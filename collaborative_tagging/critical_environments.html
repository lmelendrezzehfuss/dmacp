        Changes in the environment affect all living organisms. The reaction of biota to these changes depends 
        on both their character and scale, and on the ability of an organism or a group of organisms to tolerate them. 
        Environmental changes dramatically accelerated after the mid-twentieth century, which is a proposed starting date of 
        the Anthropocene Epoch, compared to the earlier slow-progressing changes caused solely by natural factors. Rapid human 
        population growth limits the availability of areas and resources necessary for the proper functioning of ecosystems, which 
        causes habitat fragmentation, habitat loss, and the overexploitation of populations. Contaminants emitted into the environment
        from anthropogenic sources are another example of human-induced stress on all living organisms, including humans. The reactions
        of biota to such environmental changes include shifts in population ranges, biodiversity loss, species extinctions, as well as 
        adaptive evolutionary response. In this essay we present examples of human-induced changes representing major threats to 
        ecosystems during the Anthropocene. We focus on both physical factors (land-use changes) and on different types of contaminants
        that can have adverse effects on organisms in the critical zone. The critical zone refers to the terrestrial surface and 
        near-surface environment which supports life on Earth. 
      </p>
    
      <p id="P2">
        Land-use changes, such as the conversion of forests to arable lands and urbanization, promote soil erosion and runoff, which 
             often lead to species decline and extinction through habitat fragmentation, degradation, and/or habitat loss. 
        Even if those changes do not cause immediate species extinctions, they may affect reproductive capacity, modify species 
        interactions such as food webs, and change the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Reduced habitat availability and quality 
        increases competition and predation. Modified habitats provide opportunities for colonization and expansion by new species,
        including invasive ones. It has been shown that invasive species are generally more tolerant to changes in the environment than
        non-invasive ones. The predominance of invasive species in an ecosystem causes a loss in biodiversity.
      </p>
    
      <p id="P3">
      Contaminants can be toxic and have an adverse effect on living organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. Some 
        contaminants may also react with natural substances or with other pollutants and cause more serious deterioration of the
        environment. For example, when acidifying compounds (precursors of acidity, such as sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air)
        are deposited in lakes and rivers and on land, they cause a drop in the pH of surface waters, groundwaters, and soils. Some of the 
        consequences of the acidification of soils and surface waters include the increased mobility and bioavailability of potentially toxic
        metals such as aluminum. 
      </p>

      <h3>
      Acidification in the terrestrial and marine hydrosphere
      </h3>
    
      <p id="P4">
        In many regions in the world, the acidification of poorly buffered lakes and rivers caused by a drop in the pH value of precipitation 
        led to serious environmental problems, especially in the later part of the twentieth century, such as fish kills and forest decline.
        Sulfuric and nitric acids (H2SO4, HNO3) produced in the process of chemical transformations of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in 
        the air were deposited as acid precipitation. These chemical transformations have anthropogenic sources: Livestock farming is a major 
        source of ammonia which undergoes nitrification, producing H+ ions and thus lowering the pH of rainfall. Acidification caused by NH3/NH4+ 
        is delayed in time, but it is as effective as that caused by sulfur and nitrogen dioxides. Although S and N emissions to the atmosphere have
        declined in many regions of the world, climate change acts to confound recovery from acidification. For example, increased storminess draws 
        up additional chloride ions to surface waters, reducing their acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and pH.
      </p>
    
      <p id="P5">
        Ocean acidification, caused by an increase in atmospheric CO2 emissions, changes the carbonate system which creates a risk of marine biodiversity 
        loss, especially for those organisms that build shells, tests, and skeletons of calcium carbonate, which include corals, mollusks, echinoderms, 
        crustose algae, and foraminifers. Ocean acidification events have had a profound impact on organisms during Earth’s history, and the current pH
        value of surface ocean water (8.1) is probably the lowest it has been for the last two million years.
      </p>
    
      <p id="P6">
        Reduced pH often leads to elevated metal mobilization from soils and sediments (due to desorption and dissolution), increased solubility in
        soil solutions and surface waters, and shifts to more toxic chemical species. For example, before the remediation of the abandoned Iron Mountain 
        Mine (California, USA), water concentrations of Zn, Cu, and Cd ions on site were several grams per liter; these concentrations exceed by thousands
        of times the concentrations considered safe for aquatic organisms. Measured to have a pH value below 3.0, the mine’s wastewater caused several 
        massive fish kills when discharged into the Sacramento River. Such local extinctions of acid-sensitive species also cause imbalances in the 
        biogeochemical cycles within freshwater systems. An acidic surface water pH decreases the bioavailability of nutrients and other bioessential 
        elements, such as phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. 
      </p>

      <p id="P7">
        Anthropogenic acidification occurs rapidly. Natural acidification, in contrast, is usually a long-term process, caused by carbonic acid in 
        precipitation, surface and groundwaters, and by the accumulation and dissociation of humic acids  (both of these are weak acids). These, 
        combined with a gradual decrease in the rate of soil mineral weathering, as well as the oxidation of N and S compounds, slowly lowers the pH of 
        soils over time. Thus, the response of aquatic organisms to rapid acidification is not based on long-term evolutionary adaptations, and rapid 
        acidification often leads to species decline.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Eutrophication and hypoxia in aquatic environments
      </h3>

      <p id="P8">
        Increased industrial nitrogen and phosphorus inputs recorded globally since the early 1900s cause eutrophication (an excess accumulation of nutrients) 
        in aquatic environments. Phosphorus and nitrogen are limiting factors for algal growth and their increased availability results in algal blooms. The
        growth of algae, in turn, produces a large amount of organic matter, which consumes oxygen during decomposition. This often leads to hypoxia (a 
        depletion in oxygen) or even anoxia (a lack of oxygen) in aquatic systems. Estuaries and coastal areas are especially affected by nutrient 
        overload which has resulted in a significant spread of hypoxia globally.
      </p>

      <p id="P9">
        Eutrophication leads to changes in community structure through the loss of intolerant or sensitive species and the increase of opportunistic 
        species. The loss of up to 60 percent of coral biodiversity by eutrophication has been observed in parts of Indonesia. In Australia and North
        America, complete communities of vascular plant species have disappeared due to the competitive effects of eutrophication. Anoxia resulting 
        from eutrophication causes extensive fish kills. Shallow, coastal, and estuarine areas where low oxygen levels have caused the loss of marine
        life are often referred to as “dead zones.” One of the best-known examples of a hypoxic “dead zone” is found west of the Mississippi delta,
        taking up an area of approximately 20,000 km2.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Potentially toxic trace elements
      </h3>

      <p id="P10">
        Anthropogenic pollution with metals started in prehistoric times with the development of metal ore mining and smelting. This long history of
        metal use has left a clear signal in different environmental archives. However, global-scale metal pollution accelerated in the mid-twentieth
        century not only from metal ore mining and smelting, but also from fossil-fuel combustion; this is especially true for lead, copper, mercury,
        and zinc (Table 1). Production and consumption trends for Cu, Pb, and Zn show that about 90 percent of each of these metals was used during the 
        twentieth century. The most important source of the chromium, manganese, tin, and thallium present in the environment is coal combustion which,
        along with artisanal gold mining, is also one of the major sources of environmental mercury. Emissions from oil combustion are the predominant
        industrial sources of nickel and vanadium in the atmosphere. Many metals present in environments, including Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn originate
        from non-ferrous metal production. The fluxes of copper, lead and zinc increased dramatically after World War II, and then started to decline 
        around the 1980s in industrialized countries. Lead emissions reached a peak between the 1960s to the 1980s and then decreased due to a variety 
        of measures: the implementation of air pollution control technologies, reductions in the maximum allowable concentrations of lead in gasoline 
        followed by the introduction of unleaded gasoline, and, finally, the phase-out and elimination of leaded gasoline altogether. 
      </p>

      <p id="P11">
        Metals, except for mercury, occur in the air as constituents of airborne particulates. In the form of sub-micron aerosols with long atmospheric
        residence times, they can travel thousands of kilometers from their source regions and are transported to the most remote parts of the globe. 
        Atmospheric deposition of metals in the form of aerosols is one of the most important sources of these elements in surface environments, including
        waters. The history of the changing sources and intensity of atmospheric metal deposition can be reconstructed using environmental archives such 
        as peat bogs, ice cores, and aquatic sediments. Freshwater (especially varved lakes) and anoxic marine sediments can also be used, although in some 
        instances these sites may be disturbed by complex geochemical processes or bioturbation. 
      </p>
    
      <p id="P12">
        Metals occur in the environment as different chemical species, including elemental forms, free ions, complexes, and inorganic compounds. Their 
        behavior in the environment is complex, and changes in chemical forms are common as a result of both natural processes (e.g., microbially-mediated 
        biomethylation), or anthropogenic activity (e.g., dissolution of salts in acidic waters). The mobilization of metals from polluted sites may 
        increase their bioavailability and toxicity.
      </p>

      <p id="P13">
        Some of these metals are bioessential trace elements, such as zinc, manganese, copper, and iron; others, including cadmium, lead, and mercury 
        are potentially toxic to all living organisms. There are several plant species tolerant to high concentrations of metals (metallophytes), but
        their tolerance is a result of evolutionary adaptation to soils that are naturally enriched in metals. For example, sap of the tree Pycnandra 
        acuminata growing on nickel-rich ultramafic soil in New Caledonia contains a concentration of up to 25 percent nickel. Anthropogenic metal pollution 
        creates relatively novel environments for living organisms with toxic metals as abiotic stressors. However, some organisms can easily adapt to new
        environmental conditions and even take advantage of the presence of contaminants: testate amoebae, for example, use fly ash particles for shell
        construction in a heavily polluted ombrotrophic peatland in the Izery Mountains at the border of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany. 
      </p>

      <h3>
        Organic contaminants 
      </h3>

      <p id="P14">
        Organic contaminants are compounds that occur in the environment from either natural (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) or
        anthropogenic sources (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Organic contaminants began to cause a major concern in the 1960s when
        the adverse effect of organochlorine pesticides became evident. Numerous organic compounds, with a wide range of molecular structures 
        and properties, have been released into the environment from anthropogenic sources. They are usually liquids or solids showing
        hydrophobic and semi-volatile characteristics. Their tendency to be soluble in lipids gives them their bioaccumulative properties, a 
        tendency for accumulation in sediments and soils, and for biomagnification in the food chain. Many organic contaminants are resistant 
        to microbial and oxidative degradation, and therefore have a long residence time in the environment. In the atmosphere, they are subjected 
        to long-range transport either in the gaseous phase or adsorbed onto solid particulates. Because of these properties, organic contaminants
        have been recorded in the most remote areas of the world. 
      </p>

      <p id="P15">
        Because of their toxicity, bioaccumulative properties, and very long residence time in the environment, the most important group of organic 
        pollutants are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). POPs can be divided into three classes: pesticides, industrial chemicals, and by-products. 
        Pesticides are mostly used in agriculture as insecticides and herbicides. They are also applied to control insect-borne diseases, although their
        use for this purpose has been restricted to several locations. In the 1970s many countries banned the use of organochlorine pesticides, the 
        best-known example of which is dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). The other main persistent pollutants of this class are dieldrin, endrin, 
        hexachlorophene, and hexachlorocyclohexane isomers.
      </p>

      <p id="P16">
        The POP class of industrial chemicals includes polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and per- and 
        polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs). PCBs had a number of industrial applications, mostly as liquids in capacitors and transformers. They were 
        also added to paints, lubricants, solvents, and plasticizers. The use and production of PCBs was banned in the US in the late 1970s, and in Europe 
        in the 1980s. PBDEs, produced since the 1970s and banned in Europe in the 2000s, were utilized as flame retardants, fumigants, and antifungals. PFCs 
        are mainly used as protective coatings on paper and textiles, as fire-fighting foams, and as leveling agents for paints and lubricants. They are very 
        resistant to degradation because the carbon-fluorine bond present in their molecule is one of the strongest chemical bonds—for this reason they have
        been labelled “forever chemicals.” Concentration trends of both pesticides and industrial chemicals in environmental archives usually follow their
        trends in production and use, and show sharp decline after they are banned. However, there can be a lag in reduction in concentrations of these 
        compounds in sediments due to delayed transport within catchments subsequent to deposition. 
      </p>

      <p id="P17">
        Dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are examples of the third class of POPs, the by-products, which are not intentionally 
        produced for specific applications. These compounds may also originate from natural sources under specific conditions, such as volcanic 
        emissions and wildfires. However, most come from anthropogenic sources, such as fossil fuel combustion and the combustion of organic materials
        in the presence of chlorine releasing dioxins. Various dates for maximum inputs of PAHs have been recorded in sediments worldwide. The peaks of 
        PAH concentrations were found in sediments layers from the 1950s in Europe and the US, the 1960–70s in South America, from the 1980s to the present 
        in China, and in the 1940s in Japan. Dioxins in sediment cores from Europe and the US show increasing trends from the 1940s and peak concentrations
        between the 1960s and the 1970s.
      </p>

      <p id="P18">
        POPs are toxic to humans, and chronic exposure to low doses of POPs can be carcinogenic. Some of the POPs, for example PCBs and dioxins, are endocrine
        disruptors. PCBs cause growth defects, liver damage, and may be carcinogenic to aquatic organisms. Although the levels of PCBs in the environment
        decreased after restrictions on their use in many countries, the high persistence of these pollutants often allows their presence to remain at toxic
        concentrations, and such legacy pollutants still appear to adversely affect biota. Because POPs bioaccumulate as they are transferred through the food 
        chain, their toxicity mostly affects top predators, reducing reproduction and causing long-term population decline. For example, after prolonged exposure
        to POPs, regional extinctions in predatory birds were observed. Insecticides cause regional decline in terrestrial insects, fish, and bird populations. 
        Some POPs impair physiological processes in individuals, including immune suppression. Such effects were found in seals and white-tailed eagles in the 
        Baltic Sea environment. Organometallic compounds, such as organotin compounds (e.g., tributyltin, triphenyltin) used in antifouling paints, cause 
        reproductive failure in marine gastropods.
      </p>

      <p id="P19">
        Pharmaceuticals represent another important group of biologically active chemicals in the aquatic environment. They consist of thousands of individual 
        compounds used for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases in humans and domesticated animals. These include, amongst others, antibiotics, hormonal
        contraceptives, anti-inflammatory drugs, antihypertensives, and analgesics. Some pharmaceuticals are extremely stable in the environment. For example,
        gadolinium complexes used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging are not degraded in wastewater treatment plants, and may be transported several
        kilometers after their release into rivers. Some pharmaceuticals are endocrine disruptors (e.g. 17β-estradiol); others, such as antibiotics and 
        anti-inflammatory drugs, induce oxidative stress in cells, cause changes in enzymatic processes, and are genotoxic and cytotoxic.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Microplastics  
      </h3>

      <p id="P20">
        Microplastics are polymers with dimensions <5 mm, however some authors define their size as <1 mm or even 0.06-0.5 mm. Microplastic fragments,
        microbeads, and fibers are ubiquitous in aquatic and surface environments. They have been found on the coastlines of every continent, in deep-sea 
        and remote locations, in lake and river sediments, soils, air, plants, as well as animal and human tissues. Microplastics have also been found in 
        food consumed by humans. Recent studies have documented the ingestion of 39,000-52,000 particles per year per person in North America. Considering
        other sources of microplastics in humans (inhalation and intake with drinking water) increases these estimates dramatically. 
      </p>

      <p id="P21">
        The most important sources of microplastics are residential households (with washing machines producing 100 particles/L), landfills, industrial 
        facilities, ships and marine platforms, agriculture, and tire abrasion. It has been shown that toxic organic compounds in seawater are preferentially 
        adsorbed into plastic particles. Microplastics are able to adsorb, accumulate and transport POPs in the environment; however, the potential health
        hazards from desorption of POPs from microplastics to biota or humans have not been assessed. The toxicity of microplastic can be caused by additives
        such as plasticizers, antioxidants, anti-static agents, and flame retardants. Some of these compounds interfere with metabolic processes mediated 
        by hormones (e.g., phthalates). These additives are leached directly into fresh and marine waters, and they can also be absorbed by organisms that 
        consume microplastic particles.
      </p>

      <p id="P22">
        It has been estimated that in marine environments, over 250 species are regularly ingesting plastic. Microplastics disrupt algal feeding, cause 
        a significant decline in freshwater invertebrate and amphibian populations, decrease copepod fertility, impair water filtering in sessile animals, 
        and induce an inflammatory response in a wide range of organisms. Trophic level transfer of microplastics in the marine food web is also a cause 
        for concern. Current environmental concentrations of microplastics include a considerable legacy component due to plastic durability, the recycling 
        of microplastics through food chains, and the transfers between storage and release in dynamic sedimentary systems (Bancone et al. 2020).
      </p>

      <h3>
        Other human-induced changes
      </h3>

      <p id="P23">
        Of the other factors which may have an impact on the proper function of ecosystems, the most important are light pollution and noise. Light 
        pollution in terrestrial environments is primarily caused by building and area lighting, advertising, and streetlights, whereas in marine 
        environments light pollution comes mostly from the artificial light from coastal cities. Noise pollution originates from numerous sources on land, 
        including industry and traffic. Recreational boating, shipping, and industrial activity are examples of noise pollution sources in the aquatic
        environment. Changes in environmental light levels result in shifts in the timing of living activities, which can lead to reduced foraging success, 
        such as in the case of marine turtles showing impaired seaward orientation. Noise can be considered as a factor disrupting effective communication in 
        animals. After exposure to noise levels of about 40 dBA, different responses were observed on individual, population, and ecosystem levels: The most 
        important effects of noise on animals are altered vocal behavior, avoidance of noisy habitats, and altered vigilance and foraging behavior, all of 
        which can produce changes in ecosystem structure. Acoustic pollution in the marine environment is also believed to adversely affect reproduction 
        of marine mammals.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Documenting anthropogenic changes in environmental archives
      </h3>

      <p id="P24">
        Past anthropogenic changes can be reconstructed from analyses of certain indicators such as contaminants in dateable samples. Environmental 
        archives are natural depositories of information, which happen to record the history of anthropogenic impacts on the environment. In order to 
        obtain new knowledge of temporal changes of the compounds of interest that are preserved in environmental archives (e.g., contaminant concentrations 
        during the Anthropocene), a multistep approach is needed. Five major steps in such studies are schematized in Figure 1.
      </p>

      <p id="P25">
        Both abiotic and biotic environmental archives that register emission trends over time can be used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions 
        (Figure 2). Samples are collected, divided into increments, and then split into subsamples which are subjected to age dating and all of the analyses 
        of interest (e.g. physical, chemical, mineralogical, and isotopic measurements).    
      </p>

      <p id="P26">
        Samples corresponding to the Anthropocene should be dated with a high degree of resolution, preferentially using more than one method (Figure 3). 
        Some environmental archives, such as ice cores, tree rings, and laminated lake sediments, show annual or seasonal layers which can be used for 
        high-precision dating.
      </p>

      <p id="P27">
        Natural archive samples typically require dedicated and unique sampling strategies and specific methods of sample treatment. Undisturbed cores 
        of peat and unconsolidated sediments are critical for accurate dating and precise reconstructions. Usually, two parallel cores are sampled with 
        specialized devices in order to minimize errors from sampling. Ice core sampling and analysis requires additional, special precautions: because 
        of the extremely low concentrations of contaminants and other Anthropocene signals in polar regions, the outermost layers must be careful removed 
        in a clean lab environment to allow study of the innermost, uncontaminated samples. In the case of studying microplastics as an Anthropocene signal,
        density separation in salt solutions varying in concentration is required for isolation of microplastics from the matrix.
      </p>

      <p id="P28">
        The Anthropocene signals can be measured and determined using a variety of optical methods and analytical techniques. For the determination of 
        metals, a wide variety of spectroscopic methods can be used. Persistent organic pollutants are determined with applications of chromatographic 
        methods. Stable isotopes and many radioactive isotopes are measured using a range of mass spectrometry techniques. More details about the methods 
        of the Anthropocene signal determinations in environmental archive samples can be found in Gałuszka et al., 2017.
      </p>

      <p id="P29">
        Anthropogenic changes in the environment, beyond just their character and scale, are remarkable because they affect all living organisms 
        and all environments. Numerous responses of biota to these changes have been observed, from behavioral avoidance to the adaptation to new habitats.
        Pollution with metals, persistent organic compounds, organometallic compounds and microplastics, and light and noise are new limiting factors to
        all species, especially to sensitive ones. This leads evolutionary ecologists to claim that humans have become a new evolutionary force.
        Anthropogenic changes in the environment are rapid in comparison with most natural changes and have created evolutionarily novel conditions 
        for organisms. However, not all parts of the world have been equally affected by anthropogenic activities. Spatial and temporal trends in 
        contamination show different patterns in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with greater intensity of contamination in more
        industrialized regions. However, some of the pollutants, including many pharmaceuticals and persistent organic pollutants, are biologically 
        active even at very low concentrations. Biodiversity loss as a consequence of anthropogenic activity has reached rates unprecedented in 
        the history of human civilization. 
      </p>

      <p id="P30">
        Although our knowledge on how multiple stressors might interact to affect living organisms in their habitats is still limited, the interactive
        effects of surface water acidification with toxic metals have been studied in more detail. What is clear is that changes in ecosystem structure 
        and functioning, often leading to population declines, regional extinctions, and the predominance of opportunistic, invasive species, will
        leave a signal in future fossil records which, together with historical trends in accumulation of contaminants in the environmental 
        archives, will document the history of the human impact on the environment in the Anthropocene Epoch.
