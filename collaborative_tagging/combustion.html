            According to one influential hypothesis, it might have happened early enough to help make our ancestors into big-brained humans (Wrangham 2019): cooking expanded the repertory of digestible foods, including high-quality animal proteins otherwise inedible for creatures with our teeth, jaws, and stomachs. Fire allowed our ancestors to out-source part of the digestion process.
        </p>
        <p id="P2">
            Aside from cooking, which involved tiny amounts of biomass fuel, the main purpose to which early humans put fire was landscape and ecosystem modification. Burning encouraged the growth of fresh grass and shoots, creating landscapes conducive to large herbivore herds, and thus to human hunting.

            In arid Australia, indigenous Australians (Aboriginals) relied on controlled fire known as &ldquo;firestick farming&rdquo; not only to boost populations of kangaroo and wallaby, but also of edible plants such as bush potato <em>(Ipomoea costata).</em> Human colonization of the globe also extended to high latitude landscapes where fire&rsquo;s warmth allowed Pleistocene humans to survive in Siberia and northern North America. The extent of these ancient uses of anthropogenic fire varied with climate, population size, and distribution.

            Burnt remains in the archaeological record indicate a range of social, foodstuff, and technological complexities. Stratigraphic evidence of combustion occurs as a range of prepared structures or features (hearths), stratified deposits of ash, charcoal, and charred waste, as well as fuel/foodstuffs expressed in stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (Choy et al. 2016).

            a much more useful metal than any available before, and this greatly expanded the scale of metallurgy and industrial combustion. Wood and charcoal served as fuels. The scale of metallurgy expanded once again when smiths developed the complicated procedures for making iron. Iron melts at temperatures above 1,538 degrees Celsius, beyond the range of early furnaces, and requires elaborate efforts to remove impurities.

            It may have developed independently in the Great Lakes region of Africa and in northern India.

                This period, termed &ldquo;the Great Acceleration,&rdquo; which marks the start of the proposed Anthropocene Epoch, saw an extraordinary increase in human energy use (Syvitski et al. 2020). This increase was not only for electricity generation and other industrial processes, but also from a massive increase in transport involving the combustion of gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuels.

            Combustion markers
        </h3>
        <p id="P6">
            The combustion of fossil fuels and biomass is a major driving force behind many observed impacts of the Anthropocene, and these fuels give rise to a range of particulate and gaseous products which may potentially be used as global markers. Many combustion products have been used as markers for historical reconstruction; black carbon (BC) is the most common. BC is a collective term that includes all thermally-altered carbonaceous materials generated from the burning of fossil fuels or biomass. From charred biomass to charcoal, industrial fly-ash to highly refractory &ldquo;soot,&rdquo; these materials together make up the BC &ldquo;combustion continuum&rdquo; (Masiello 2004). As there is no universally accepted definition for the term BC, many synonyms such as elemental carbon (EC), graphitic carbon, charcoal, char, SCPs, fly-ash, carbon black, and soot are also widely used. Here, we provide a summary of these terms:
        </p>
        <p id="P7">
            <strong>Soot</strong> (Figure 1) is a combustion condensate formed via gas-to-particle conversion at high temperatures. It is a secondary aerosol with a fine (sub-micron) grape-like morphology and can indicate combustion at a regional to continental scale.
        </p>
        <p id="P8">
            <strong>Charcoal</strong> is a biomass combustion residue that may retain some original biomass structure. It has been used as an indicator for wildfires (or biomass burning, both human and natural), and particle size-distributions can be used to indicate local or regional sources.
        </p>
        <p id="P9">
            <strong>Spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs),</strong> (Figure 2) a component of fly-ash, are an industrial combustion residue derived from industrial coal and oil combustion. SCPs have an unambiguous morphology and no natural sources. Particle sizes vary from micron to 75&ndash;100&#956;m, and distribution in the atmosphere varies accordingly.
        </p>
        <p id="P10">
            <strong>Brown carbon (BrC)</strong> derives mainly from biomass burning although smaller contributions come from fossil fuel emissions and secondary formation (Andreae and Gelencser 2006). As the name suggests it maybe differentiated from BC by its color, but it, too, absorbs sunlight in the atmosphere and may be placed at the lower refractory end of the combustion &ldquo;continuum.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p id="P11">
            <strong>Elemental carbon (EC)</strong> is a term often used interchangeably with BC. However, BC and EC have different usages in both aerosol and soil and sediment sciences. For example, in aerosol science, BC mainly refers to particles measured by optical methods to indicate their light-absorbing characteristics, while EC is more commonly used to indicate the refractiveness of this kind of carbon. In soil and sediment science, however, the term BC is more commonly used, while EC is used for some thermal methods, and is sometimes replaced by the term &ldquo;graphitic carbon.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p id="P12">
            <strong>Char</strong> (Figure 3) was originally thought to originate mainly from biomass burning or wildfires. It is measured as total carbon concentrations with chemical, thermal, or thermal/optical methods. Concentrations of char likely include not only the residues of biomass burning, but also emissions from fossil-fuel combustion; char can thus be considered a general term for all refractory combustion residues.
        </p>
        <p id="P13">
            In general, BC can be regarded as the sum of char (combustion residues) and soot (combustion condensates). Soot is only produced from fires with flames, and more soot is emitted as combustion efficiency increases. By contrast, char can also originate from smoldering fires, and production increases with a decrease in combustion efficiency. Therefore char and soot may be used to indicate different fire types in wildfire reconstruction, although differences in their potential transport distance in the atmosphere influences the ratio of char/soot found in the environment (Han et al. 2009). As fossil-fuel combustion generally has a high combustion efficiency, modern industrial emissions and especially those from vehicles would likely result in low char/soot ratios, which could make soot a good marker for industrial development in the Anthropocene. Stable isotopic signatures of carbon, released during combustion, may also be used to reflect the range of fuel carbon sources (geological-biological origin), the nature of the combustion process itself, and the form of carbon by-products emitted (particle or gas). Characterizing stable carbon isotope composition of BC can assist in tracing urban atmospheric pollution sources. The combination of stable isotope and radiocarbon analyses may provide more exact information on sources. This approach, which has been widely used for source appointment in aerosol studies, may also be
            applied to geological archives.
        </p>
        <p id="P14">
            Apart from refractory BC emissions, some organic compounds and thermally altered products may be used as combustion markers. For example, some magnetic parameters may be modified in combustion and wildfires (Conedera et al. 2009) while the increase in some trace elements such as lead, arsenic, and copper are related to industrial emissions and vehicle exhausts, and coal combustion is a major source of mercury emissions. Organic chemical combustion markers (summarized in Conedera et al., 2009) include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and monosaccharide anhydrides. However, due to the instability and degradation of some organic markers, their use as stratigraphic indicators may be limited. By comparison, BC records are likely to suffer less from degradation. Gaseous combustion products include CO2, CO, CH4, NO, SO2, and some volatile organic carbons (VOCs). Carbon dioxide, NO, NO2, N2O, and molecular N2 are released predominantly during flaming combustion, whereas CO, CH3, NH3, amines, and nitriles are mainly associated with smoldering fires. VOCs may be promising combustion markers as their composition can be related to specific sources. For example, coal combustion emissions may be enriched in ethylene, acetylene, ethane, propane, naphthalene, and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes), while gasoline vehicle exhausts may be enriched in light alkanes as well as iso-pentane, 2-methyl-petane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, 1,3-butadiene, and BTEX. Some ratios of VOC species have also been used in source identification: For example, the ratio of toluene to benzene (T/B) ranges from 1.5&ndash;2.0 in mobile sources, particularly in gasoline exhaust, while in biomass burning and coal combustion it ranges from 0.23&ndash;0.68 and from 0.13&ndash;0.71, respectively (Wang et al. 2009).

            Combustion stratigraphy
        </h3>
        <p id="P15">
            The definition of a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the proposed Anthropocene Epoch allows for the consideration of a wide range of natural archives including lake and marine sediments, ice cores and peat sequences, and speleothems and tree rings. Many of these have not been appropriate or available for the definition of previous geological time divisions, but a number of these do contain records of combustion products, as well as fulfilling the additional criterion of high or annual temporal resolution. One interesting and recent example is the use of accumulating baleen whale earplugs, which may be used to observe changes in the marine environment over periods of decades (Mansouri et al. 2020). Here, stable carbon isotope records with an approximate six-month resolution indicate declining trends in &#948;13C as a result of the Suess effect, i.e. the depletion of atmospheric 13CO2 due to anthropogenic fossil-fuel combustion. This example also provides a demonstration of the ubiquitous nature of combustion products in many environmental compartments.
        </p>
        <p id="P16">
            Methods employed in determining stratigraphic records of BC from environmental archives can be divided into five different categories: optical, thermal, microscopic, chemical, and indirect (e.g., molecular markers). Optical methods, usually used in atmospheric sciences, rely on the light-absorbing properties of BC; thermal methods, mainly used for analysis of sediments and soils, rely on its resistance to degradation, in particular oxidation. Chemical methods determine BC as that which resists chemical extraction (e.g., removal of organic material and inorganic minerals with acid treatments), and this may be followed by microscopic techniques for specific particle types, such as charcoal and SCPs, which are counted after the chemical extraction has removed unwanted components of the surrounding matrix. For most methods it is not possible to define with precision which components of the BC continuum are being measured. No single analytical method measures the whole range, and it is likely that overlap between particle types within the continuum results in discrepancy between analytical approaches. Such deficiency makes comparisons between studies using different analytical methods problematic, except where particle types can be more precisely defined by their morphology with specific identification criteria (e.g. SCPs).

            The particulate by-products of both natural and anthropogenic combustion are well represented in archives. The records of naturally generated char and charcoal have been used for decades as a means to reconstruct wildfire frequency and by implication, climatic change over time scales of millennia to millions of years. Due to their size, these particles are unlikely to travel long distances in the atmosphere, and so their records likely indicate local and regional combustion.

                more recently, sources in China and India have become more important (Ruppel et al. 2013).
            </span>
            As a consequence, it has been suggested that uniform records of BC at the global scale should not be expected (Han et al. 2018). Falling somewhere in between soot and char&mdash;in terms of both size and combustion temperature&mdash;are SCPs. Records of SCPs have mainly been generated from lake sediments but have also been produced from ice, peat, and marine sediments. To date, SCP records in these other archives, along with records in the Southern Hemisphere more generally, remain sparse.
            <span resource="#i11">
                <meta property="time:intervalStarts" resource="#d20" />
                However, available data indicate that a rapid increase in SCP accumulation may occur globally in the mid-twentieth century, and SCPs have been suggested as a stratigraphic marker for the Anthropocene (Rose 2015).
            </span>
        </p>
        <p id="P16">
            Like BC, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also generated by both natural and anthropogenic combustion of organic materials, and their records in natural archives have been widely used to assess changes in emissions from many sources. While &ldquo;total&rdquo; PAHs have been used to indicate historical trends in overall combustion, high- and low-molecular weight (HMW; LMW) classes have been used to distinguish anthropogenic from natural sources, and individual congeners and PAH ratios may be used to identify more specific sources and classes of combustion. For example, retene and benzo(a)pyrene are sometimes used to indicate wood combustion and vehicular emissions respectively, while the ratio between fluoranthene and the sum of fluoranthene and pyrene has been used to distinguish between the combustion of biomass, coal, and petroleum.
        </p>
        <p id="P17">
            Although not all the many gaseous and particulate products of combustion are able to provide the globally synchronous marker required for a GSSP, and while acknowledging the current geographical limitations to available data, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, combustion products can provide a clear anthropogenic signal with the potential to be of great stratigraphic utility as they represent a primary driving force of global anthropogenic change.

                Significant increases in combustion emissions have occurred since the mid-nineteenth century, 
            </span>
            <span resource="#i11">
                and especially since the mid-twentieth century Great Acceleration, as a result of fossil-fuel combustion in electricity generation and vehicle emissions.
            </span>
            However, natural archives show that records of combustion cover millennia, and so recent trends must be contextualized in the long-term human relationship with combustion. Furthermore, feedback mechanisms have the potential to exacerbate contributions to natural archives and may confound future stratigraphic interpretation. For example, the melting of glaciers and ice caps and the climatically-enhanced erosion of catchment soils is now understood to be remobilizing combustion products (mercury, SCPs, and PAHs) from long-term storage, returning them to environmental and biotic availability.
