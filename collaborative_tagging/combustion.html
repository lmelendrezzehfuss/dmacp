                The long career of fire
            </h3>
            <p>
                Since the oxygenation of the atmosphere some two billion years ago, and the evolution of terrestrial vegetation
                roughly half a billion years ago, Earth has been a fiery planet. For the last half million years or more, a growing
                proportion of fire on Earth has been caused by species of the genus Homo, in most cases Homo sapiens. Of that
                anthropogenic fire, much has been accidental, but a growing proportion has served specific human ends. The date of
                hominin harnessing of fire is uncertain but probably lies between 1.5 and 0.5 million years Before Present (BP).
                According to one influential hypothesis, it might have happened early enough to help make our ancestors into
                big-brained humans (Wrangham 2019): cooking expanded the repertory of digestible foods, including high-quality
                animal proteins otherwise inedible for creatures with our teeth, jaws, and stomachs. Fire allowed our ancestors to
                out-source part of the digestion process. Aside from cooking, which involved tiny amounts of biomass fuel, the main
                purpose to which early humans put fire was landscape and ecosystem modification. Burning encouraged the growth of
                fresh grass and shoots, creating landscapes conducive to large herbivore herds, and thus to human hunting. The use
                of combustion for these purposes began in Africa but travelled with humans as they colonized the globe after about
                100,000 years BP. In arid Australia, indigenous Australians (Aboriginals) relied on controlled fire known as
                &ldquo;firestick farming&rdquo; not only to boost populations of kangaroo and wallaby, but also of edible plants
                such as bush potato (Ipomoea costata). Human colonization of the globe also extended to high latitude landscapes
                where fire&rsquo;s warmth allowed Pleistocene humans to survive in Siberia and northern North America. The extent of
                these ancient uses of anthropogenic fire varied with climate, population size, and distribution. Sedentary societies
                around the world developed pottery, the oldest of which dates from East Asia some 20,000 years BP. Kiln-fired
                pottery, using wood and charcoal for fuel, appeared on a small scale about 8,000 years BP in Southwest Asia. Burnt
                remains in the archaeological record indicate a range of social, foodstuff, and technological complexities.
                Stratigraphic evidence of combustion occurs as a range of prepared structures or features (hearths), stratified
                deposits of ash, charcoal, and charred waste, as well as fuel/foodstuffs expressed in stable isotopes of carbon and
                nitrogen (Choy et al. 2016).
            </p>
            <p>
                The first genuinely industrial use of fire came with metallurgy. Lead, tin, and copper were smelted from rock on
                small scales in southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia from the sixth millennium BCE, although earlier finds are
                likely in future. By about 3500 BCE, smiths in Mesopotamia had figured out how to combine copper with tin to make
                bronze, a much more useful metal than any available before, and this greatly expanded the scale of metallurgy and
                industrial combustion. Wood and charcoal served as fuels. The scale of metallurgy expanded once again when smiths
                developed the complicated procedures for making iron. Iron melts at temperatures above 1,538 degrees Celsius, beyond
                the range of early furnaces, and requires elaborate efforts to remove impurities. By 2000 BCE smiths in Anatolia had
                begun iron smelting, and by 1200 BCE iron-making began on a large scale in Anatolia and adjacent lands. It may have
                developed independently in the Great Lakes region of Africa and in northern India. In any case, the abundance of
                iron ore in the Earth&rsquo;s crust allowed iron working to spread throughout large parts of Eurasia and Africa,
                marking a great leap in the scale of intentional combustion. By 300 BCE, iron forges were at work from Cameroon to
                Ireland to Korea. The global center of iron production became China, where blast furnaces were invented in the final
                centuries BCE. Charcoal, which burns hotter than wood, served as the primary fuel for iron-making. Metalworking
                peaked in the southern Andes after 1100 CE but elsewhere in the pre-Columbian Americas remained small in scale.
                Overall, fuel combustion for metal production in the Americas before 1492 stood orders of magnitude below
                China&rsquo;s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond metallurgy, combustion formed an essential step in generating heat in several other traditional industries.
                Lime, made by heating limestone to 1,000 degrees Celsius, was used in plaster by the eighth millennium BCE in what
                is now Jordan; eventually it was used in mortar, cement, tanning, and fertilizer. Brickmaking with fire developed in
                China, India, and Mesopotamia in the fifth and fourth millennia BCE. Glassmaking dates to the third millennium BCE.
                Sugar-refining, salt-making, and several other ancient industries also made use of combustion (McCray 2007). The
                scale of combustion for industrial purposes greatly increased during the era of the Roman and Han Chinese empires in
                the second century BCE to the second century CE. Airborne pollution from Roman lead smelting found in Greenland ice
                cores and lake sediment cores across Europe indicates that Roman production, and presumably combustion, peaked in
                the first and second centuries BCE. A surge in iron and other metal production took place under China&rsquo;s Song
                dynasty in the tenth and eleventh centuries CE. Here, coal was used for the first time on a large scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coal became the primary fuel for industrial purposes following James Watt&rsquo;s developments of Thomas
                Newcomen&rsquo;s pumping engine in the UK in the late eighteenth century. This inaugurated a new phase in the
                history of combustion, although the resulting &ldquo;Industrial Revolution&rdquo; took almost two hundred years to
                develop around the globe. Before coal&rsquo;s widespread use, combustion had left its mark in strata primarily in
                the form of char. After about 1900, when global coal use surpassed that of biomass, anthropogenic combustion left
                its mark increasingly in the form of soot (Han et al. 2018). A further key step for coal combustion occurred in
                London in 1882, when the first power plant generating electricity for public lighting came into operation.
                Electricity generation became, and continues to be, a major use of coal combustion. Following World War II, the
                demand for electricity escalated, resulting in the massive expansion of industrial coal burning, supplemented by the
                combustion of fuel-oils and natural gas. This period, termed &ldquo;the Great Acceleration,&rdquo; which marks the
                start of the proposed Anthropocene Epoch, saw an extraordinary increase in human energy use (Syvitski et al. 2020).
                This increase was not only for electricity generation and other industrial processes, but also from a massive
                increase in transport involving the combustion of gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuels.

            <h3>
                Combustion markers
            </h3>
            <p>
                The combustion of fossil fuels and biomass is a major driving force behind many observed impacts of the Anthropocene,
                and these fuels give rise to a range of particulate and gaseous products which may potentially be used as global
                markers. Many combustion products have been used as markers for historical reconstruction; black carbon (BC) is the
                most common. BC is a collective term that includes all thermally-altered carbonaceous materials generated from the
                burning of fossil fuels or biomass. From charred biomass to charcoal, industrial fly-ash to highly refractory
                &ldquo;soot,&rdquo; these materials together make up the BC &ldquo;combustion continuum&rdquo; (Masiello 2004). As
                there is no universally accepted definition for the term BC, many synonyms such as elemental carbon (EC), graphitic
                carbon, charcoal, char, SCPs, fly-ash, carbon black, and soot are also widely used. Here, we provide a summary of
                these terms:
            </p>
            <p>
                Soot (Figure 1) is a combustion condensate formed via gas-to-particle conversion at high temperatures. It is a
                secondary aerosol with a fine (sub-micron) grape-like morphology and can indicate combustion at a regional to
                continental scale. Charcoal is a biomass combustion residue that may retain some original biomass structure. It has
                been used as an indicator for wildfires (or biomass burning, both human and natural), and particle
                size-distributions can be used to indicate local or regional sources. Spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs),
                (Figure 2) a component of fly-ash, are an industrial combustion residue derived from industrial coal and oil
                combustion. SCPs have an unambiguous morphology and no natural sources. Particle sizes vary from micron to
                75&ndash;100&#956;m, and distribution in the atmosphere varies accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brown carbon (BrC) derives mainly from biomass burning although smaller contributions come from fossil fuel emissions
                and secondary formation (Andreae and Gelencser 2006). As the name suggests it maybe differentiated from BC by its
                color, but it, too, absorbs sunlight in the atmosphere and may be placed at the lower refractory end of the
                combustion &ldquo;continuum.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
                Elemental carbon (EC) is a term often used interchangeably with BC. However, BC and EC have different usages in both
                aerosol and soil and sediment sciences. For example, in aerosol science, BC mainly refers to particles measured by
                optical methods to indicate their light-absorbing characteristics, while EC is more commonly used to indicate the
                refractiveness of this kind of carbon. In soil and sediment science, however, the term BC is more commonly used,
                while EC is used for some thermal methods, and is sometimes replaced by the term &ldquo;graphitic carbon.&rdquo;
                Char (Figure 3) was originally thought to originate mainly from biomass burning or wildfires. It is measured as
                total carbon concentrations with chemical, thermal, or thermal/optical methods. Concentrations of char likely
                include not only the residues of biomass burning, but also emissions from fossil-fuel combustion; char can thus be
                considered a general term for all refractory combustion residues. In general, BC can be regarded as the sum of char
                (combustion residues) and soot (combustion condensates). Soot is only produced from fires with flames, and more soot
                is emitted as combustion efficiency increases. By contrast, char can also originate from smoldering fires, and
                production increases with a decrease in combustion efficiency. Therefore char and soot may be used to indicate
                different fire types in wildfire reconstruction, although differences in their potential transport distance in the
                atmosphere influences the ratio of char/soot found in the environment (Han et al. 2009). As fossil-fuel combustion
                generally has a high combustion efficiency, modern industrial emissions and especially those from vehicles would
                likely result in low char/soot ratios, which could make soot a good marker for industrial development in the
                Anthropocene. Stable isotopic signatures of carbon, released during combustion, may also be used to reflect the
                range of fuel carbon sources (geological-biological origin), the nature of the combustion process itself, and the
                form of carbon by-products emitted (particle or gas). Characterizing stable carbon isotope composition of BC can
                assist in tracing urban atmospheric pollution sources. The combination of stable isotope and radiocarbon analyses
                may provide more exact information on sources. This approach, which has been widely used for source appointment in
                aerosol studies, may also be applied to geological archives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from refractory BC emissions, some organic compounds and thermally altered products may be used as combustion
                markers. For example, some magnetic parameters may be modified in combustion and wildfires (Conedera et al. 2009)
                while the increase in some trace elements such as lead, arsenic, and copper are related to industrial emissions and
                vehicle exhausts, and coal combustion is a major source of mercury emissions. Organic chemical combustion markers
                (summarized in Conedera et al., 2009) include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and monosaccharide anhydrides.
                However, due to the instability and degradation of some organic markers, their use as stratigraphic indicators may
                be limited. By comparison, BC records are likely to suffer less from degradation. Gaseous combustion products
                include CO2, CO, CH4, NO, SO2, and some volatile organic carbons (VOCs). Carbon dioxide, NO, NO2, N2O, and molecular
                N2 are released predominantly during flaming combustion, whereas CO, CH3, NH3, amines, and nitriles are mainly
                associated with smoldering fires. VOCs may be promising combustion markers as their composition can be related to
                specific sources. For example, coal combustion emissions may be enriched in ethylene, acetylene, ethane, propane,
                naphthalene, and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes), while gasoline vehicle exhausts may be enriched
                in light alkanes as well as iso-pentane, 2-methyl-petane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, 1,3-butadiene, and BTEX. Some
                ratios of VOC species have also been used in source identification: For example, the ratio of toluene to benzene
                (T/B) ranges from 1.5&ndash;2.0 in mobile sources, particularly in gasoline exhaust, while in biomass burning and
                coal combustion it ranges from 0.23&ndash;0.68 and from 0.13&ndash;0.71, respectively (Wang et al. 2009).

            <h3>
                Combustion stratigraphy
            </h3>
            <p>
                The definition of a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the proposed Anthropocene Epoch allows
                for the consideration of a wide range of natural archives including lake and marine sediments, ice cores and peat
                sequences, and speleothems and tree rings. Many of these have not been appropriate or available for the definition
                of previous geological time divisions, but a number of these do contain records of combustion products, as well as
                fulfilling the additional criterion of high or annual temporal resolution. One interesting and recent example is the
                use of accumulating baleen whale earplugs, which may be used to observe changes in the marine environment over
                periods of decades (Mansouri et al. 2020). Here, stable carbon isotope records with an approximate six-month
                resolution indicate declining trends in &#948;13C as a result of the Suess effect, i.e. the depletion of atmospheric
                13CO2 due to anthropogenic fossil-fuel combustion. This example also provides a demonstration of the ubiquitous
                nature of combustion products in many environmental compartments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Methods employed in determining stratigraphic records of BC from environmental archives can be divided into five
                different categories: optical, thermal, microscopic, chemical, and indirect (e.g., molecular markers). Optical
                methods, usually used in atmospheric sciences, rely on the light-absorbing properties of BC; thermal methods, mainly
                used for analysis of sediments and soils, rely on its resistance to degradation, in particular oxidation. Chemical
                methods determine BC as that which resists chemical extraction (e.g., removal of organic material and inorganic
                minerals with acid treatments), and this may be followed by microscopic techniques for specific particle types, such
                as charcoal and SCPs, which are counted after the chemical extraction has removed unwanted components of the
                surrounding matrix. For most methods it is not possible to define with precision which components of the BC
                continuum are being measured. No single analytical method measures the whole range, and it is likely that overlap
                between particle types within the continuum results in discrepancy between analytical approaches. Such deficiency
                makes comparisons between studies using different analytical methods problematic, except where particle types can be
                more precisely defined by their morphology with specific identification criteria (e.g. SCPs).
            </p>
            <p>
                Gaseous products of combustion distribute easily and rapidly in the atmosphere and global changes are clearly
                identifiable. The depletion of &#948;13C in ice cores as a result of fossil-fuel combustion has been reported since
                the 1980s, and trends in depletion show a clear inverse relationship with the increasing CO2 concentrations also
                stored in these sequences, concentrations which are now known to be unprecedented over hundreds of thousands of
                years. Similarly, industrially-derived reactive nitrogen emitted into the atmosphere is depleted in 15N and
                reductions in &#948;15N, especially since the mid-twentieth century, are widely observed in natural archives
                including ice cores and lake sediments in remote locations (Holtgrieve et al. 2011). Atmospheric mercury
                concentrations are now thought to be 450 percent higher than they were in pre-industrial times. Gaseous mercury has
                an atmospheric lifetime of about a year and can thus circle the Earth many times prior to its deposition. As a
                consequence, increases in mercury concentrations and depositional fluxes since the mid-twentieth century have been
                reported from ice cores, marine sediment cores, ombrotrophic peats, and lake sediment cores, many of which also
                demonstrate a three- to five-fold increase in mercury enrichment since the pre-industrial period.
            </p>
            <p>
                The particulate by-products of both natural and anthropogenic combustion are well represented in archives. The
                records of naturally generated char and charcoal have been used for decades as a means to reconstruct wildfire
                frequency and by implication, climatic change over time scales of millennia to millions of years. Due to their size,
                these particles are unlikely to travel long distances in the atmosphere, and so their records likely indicate local
                and regional combustion. By contrast, soot from anthropogenic combustion may be transported continentally, and
                records in ice cores and lake sediments show major increases since the mid-nineteenth century with concentration
                peaks occurring through the twentieth century depending on the region (Kaspari et al. 2011). Black carbon
                inventories indicate major shifts in the geographical distribution of emissions, with sources in Europe and North
                America dominating from the mid-nineteenth century through to the latter decades of the twentieth century; more
                recently, sources in China and India have become more important (Ruppel et al. 2013). As a consequence, it has been
                suggested that uniform records of BC at the global scale should not be expected (Han et al. 2018). Falling somewhere
                in between soot and char&mdash;in terms of both size and combustion temperature&mdash;are SCPs. Records of SCPs have
                mainly been generated from lake sediments but have also been produced from ice, peat, and marine sediments. To date,
                SCP records in these other archives, along with records in the Southern Hemisphere more generally, remain sparse.
                However, available data indicate that a rapid increase in SCP accumulation may occur globally in the mid-twentieth
                century, and SCPs have been suggested as a stratigraphic marker for the Anthropocene (Rose 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
                Like BC, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also generated by both natural and anthropogenic combustion of
                organic materials, and their records in natural archives have been widely used to assess changes in emissions from
                many sources. While &ldquo;total&rdquo; PAHs have been used to indicate historical trends in overall combustion,
                high- and low-molecular weight (HMW; LMW) classes have been used to distinguish anthropogenic from natural sources,
                and individual congeners and PAH ratios may be used to identify more specific sources and classes of combustion. For
                example, retene and benzo(a)pyrene are sometimes used to indicate wood combustion and vehicular emissions
                respectively, while the ratio between fluoranthene and the sum of fluoranthene and pyrene has been used to
                distinguish between the combustion of biomass, coal, and petroleum.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although not all the many gaseous and particulate products of combustion are able to provide the globally synchronous
                marker required for a GSSP, and while acknowledging the current geographical limitations to available data,
                especially in the Southern Hemisphere, combustion products can provide a clear anthropogenic signal with the
                potential to be of great stratigraphic utility as they represent a primary driving force of global anthropogenic
                change. Significant increases in combustion emissions have occurred since the mid-nineteenth century, and especially
                since the mid-twentieth century Great Acceleration, as a result of fossil-fuel combustion in electricity generation
                and vehicle emissions. However, natural archives show that records of combustion cover millennia, and so recent
                trends must be contextualized in the long-term human relationship with combustion. Furthermore, feedback mechanisms
                have the potential to exacerbate contributions to natural archives and may confound future stratigraphic
                interpretation. For example, the melting of glaciers and ice caps and the climatically-enhanced erosion of catchment
                soils is now understood to be remobilizing combustion products (mercury, SCPs, and PAHs) from long-term storage,
                returning them to environmental and biotic availability.
