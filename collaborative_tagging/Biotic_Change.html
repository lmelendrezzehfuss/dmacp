  Extinction, coupled with many other biological signals, is a major geological indicator of the 
  Anthropocene (Barnosky et al. 2011). The introduction of non-native species, deforestation, 
  depletion of fisheries and modification of coastal environments, domestication of animals, 
  and the reconfiguration of terrestrial ecosystems are all evident in the geological record
  and are being explored by the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) and many other investigators. 
  This essay begins by outlining the geological record of life over four billion years, the calamities
  that have occasionally erased much of its diversity, and the more recent human impacts upon it. We 
  show that lakes, seas, estuaries and wetlands provide important archives of humanity’s reconfiguration 
  of life, and we speculate on the biological and paleontological signature of the near future.

<h3>The great interactions of life</h3>

<p id="P2”>
  The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and within a billion years of its formation it was alive. 
  For much of geological time life was entirely microbial, but it has grown in mass, organism size, and 
  complexity, in the process transforming the planet to allow more life to diversify. These changes are 
  visible in the geological record.
</p>


<p id="P3”>
The early Earth was a very different place. Anoxic chemistry powered the earliest life, as both the atmosphere 
  and oceans lacked breathable oxygen. By 2.5 billion years ago cyanobacteria (“blue-green algae”) had harnessed 
  the energy of light to forge biological mass from water and carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen as a “waste” by-product.
  For much of the early life oxygen was toxic, but other organisms learned to use this “waste” to release more energy
  through respiration. The ability of life to reuse “waste” is one of its enduring structures, but human ecologies 
  produce so much that Earth is once again in a phase of toxification.

</p>

<p id="P4”>
Without oxygen, the metabolic processes of life could not have evolved to allow organisms to get bigger and more
       complex. The subsequent evolution of animals, over half a billion years ago, and the development of a 
       plant-inhabited landscape from 470 million years ago, restructured life again. All our planet’s systems
       were impacted by the resulting biochemical changes, eventually producing a world in which bipedal apes
       characterized by sophisticated cognitive functions could deliberately alter the biosphere (the biosphere 
       is all life and its interactions with air, water and earth). Although geological latecomers—Homo sapiens 
       is just 300,000 years old—humans have developed practices that are highly disruptive to life and may cause 
       a sixth mass extinction. 

</p>

<p id="P5”>
Five major mass extinctions have occurred over the last 500 million years, resulting from such factors as 
  large-scale changes in the oceans and climate, volcanism, and in one case—the end-Cretaceous extinction 
  66 million years ago—the impact of a large asteroid in the Gulf of Mexico. Each time at least 75 percent 
  of species diversity was lost, and it took millions of years for the biosphere to recover.
</p>

<p id="P6">
More recent and less catastrophic events may also provide a guide to near future change. The ‘Great American 
       Interchange’ 2.7 million years ago occurred when North and South America became joined at the Isthmus 
       of Panama. Organisms moved both ways between the continents, but physical barriers in the north—a desert 
       to cross in Mexico—and the absence of placental mammals in the south informed the way that ecosystems
       responded to the exchange. Such insights, even from the remote geological past, can help us to understand
       which of Earth’s ecologies are resilient, and which—like coral reefs and the many species that are nearly
       extinct—may not be.
</p>

<h3>Human interaction with the biosphere</h3>

<p id="P7”>
For most of human history our impact on the biosphere was negligible. We lived as hunter-gatherers, subsisting 
  off what the land could provide. This lifestyle, now restricted to small groups, is thought able to support
  a few million people. The first semi-permanent human-made dwellings that were not caves appeared 30,000 years
  ago. They are part of our increasing technological sophistication that entwines with a record of widespread
  impacts on large animals during the Late Pleistocene, called the megafauna extinctions (Koch and Barnosky 2006).
</p>
<p id="P8”>
The first permanent human settlements appeared in the eastern Mediterranean and Near East towards the end of
       the Pleistocene (from about 13,000 years ago). They are tied to the development of agriculture and
       pastoralism that accelerated changes to the biosphere—the ArchaeoGLOBE Project has tracked these developments
       over the past ten millennia (Stephens et al. 2019). Six millennia before the present many parts of the world
       had already witnessed some form of agriculture, though areas of continuous farming were still small. By the
       time of the Romans, many regions of the Earth showed the imprint of agriculture, and of the exploitation 
       of animals (Bomgardner 1992).
</p>
<p id="P9”>
Continued landscape modification has left a paleontological record, for example of the exploitative mechanisms of
  colonialism. The Columbian Exchange becomes detectable in the fossil record of maize pollen in African lakes,
  as does the introduction of pine trees by European colonizer states during the early twentieth-century “Scramble 
  for Africa.” In eastern North America, European settlement was synonymous with land clearing, where settlers 
  replaced the mixed and deciduous forests with artificial grasslands. This allowed weeds like ragweed (the not-so-aptly
  named Ambrosia) to proliferate, to the ongoing dismay of allergy sufferers. Contrary to a popular misconception,
  ragweed was not introduced to North America—it is native to the grasslands in the center of the continent—but the
  abundance of its pollen grains is a marker of regional land clearing throughout eastern North America. In all, some
  95 percent of the Earth’s ice-free landscape is modified in some way by humans (Kennedy et al. 2019); more recently 
  the oceans also show significant evidence of human impact (Halpern et al. 2008).
</p>
<p id="P10”>
Profound signals of biological change are evident in the twentieth century. One catalyst for this change is the chemistry
       of the Haber-Bosch process, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen to make fertilizers and is now necessary to feed 
       approximately half the world’s human population (Smil 1999). The scale of this process has left a visible nitrogen 
       signal in the geological record as a marker of the Anthropocene (Holtgrieve et al. 2011). To this profound change 
       we can also add the land appropriated to supply increasing meat consumption, or the use of a wide range of
       agricultural products such as oil palm that find their way into everything from toothpaste to chocolate, all 
       of which brings about a rapid decrease in living space for nonhumans. 
</p>
<p id="P11”>
The dramatic increase in the combustion of petroleum in the mid-twentieth century is reflected in the microfossil
  record, as algae respond to concentrations of atmospheric CO2 not seen in over three million years. Plants flourish 
  with higher concentrations of the basic raw material of photosynthesis, and they expend less energy taking this in,
  which is reflected in the decreased number of breathing pores called stomata in the leaves of land plants.
</p>
<p id="P12”>
In the following section we examine how these human impacts play out in many different ecosystems, and how the AWG 
       can use these signals to recognize the Anthropocene.
</p>

<h3>The fossil record of rapid changes to the biosphere</h3>

<p id="P13”>
Humans have caused the extinction of other organisms for millennia, moved animals and plants beyond their native ecologies,
  and reconfigured ecosystems. Which of these provide a fossil signature for the Anthropocene?

</p>

<p id="P14”>
To define a geological boundary, a surface of equivalent time everywhere is needed—an isochronous surface that can be
       recognized in geological successions globally. Many boundaries in deep time are marked by the first appearance 
       of a particular fossil—such as the mouthparts of a species of marine vertebrates named conodonts in the case of 
       the Triassic System (252 million years ago). This marker, or index fossil, is not present in rocks everywhere, 
       but is sufficiently widespread to enable a chain of correlation with other fossil species of the same age, and 
       with geochemical or other stratigraphical markers. Similar chains of correlation will be needed to identify the 
       Anthropocene.
</p>

<p id="P15”>
The first widespread extinction where humans were a causal mechanism is the series of prominent extinctions of large
  vertebrates termed the “Late Quaternary Extinction” at the end of the last Ice Age. In North America, this coincided
  with the arrival of the Clovis people replete with sophisticated stone tools for hunting. Large mammals including 
  the magnificent Irish elk and iconic woolly mammoth disappeared from Europe and Asia, though the latter survived in
  the eastern Arctic until about 4,000 years ago. Although these extinctions are widespread, they occurred over tens 
  of thousands of years and do not identify an isochronous surface. Nevertheless, they do identify the regional effects 
  (Barnosky et al. 2014) and progressive global impacts, of the human restructuring of the biosphere. 

</p>

<p id="P16”>
Human translocation of organisms has occurred for thousands of years, but these have accelerated since the second
       half of the twentieth century. Some translocations leave little geological trace, but other invasive biological
       agents do, creating a signal of the almost simultaneous intercontinental dispersal of many marine and terrestrial 
       species in the later twentieth century. Many of these transfers are intimately linked with the local extirpation
       of native species, and they have had, and will continue to have, the net effect of homogenizing the world’s biota 
       and depleting global biodiversity. Regions that had very different species assemblages prior to human impacts are
       now looking more and more alike as the same species take over throughout the world.

</p>

<p id="P17”>
Species translocations have been facilitated by human communication networks and by extensive habitat modifications 
  that promote the influx of non-native species. Notorious examples include the Zebra mussel—an invader of European 
  rivers for two centuries before migrating to North America in the 1980s, where it rapidly dispersed through the 
  continent’s aquatic ecologies—and the Argentinian Golden Apple Snail, which has rampaged through Southeast Asian 
  rice paddies since the 1980s. Meanwhile, on the west coast of the US, organisms from East Asia invaded the estuary 
  of San Francisco Bay in the 1980s, leaving a fossil signal of their presence (McGann et al. 2000). Identified from 
  historical contexts, human encroachment on estuary ecologies produced dramatic changes, but these have accelerated 
  from the mid-twentieth century (Cearreta et al. 2002). Biological signals include the total elimination or reduced 
  biodiversity and abundance of the original biota, the replacement of indigenous species—by others more tolerant of 
  pollution, water acidification and salinity change, and competition with non-native species—and deformities in the 
  skeletons of some organisms, resulting from environmental stress. 

</p>

<p id="P18”>
Lakes are important continental ecosystems that have been cradles of evolution. Human settlements in their catchments
       were provided with freshwater, but the lakes received the waste generated by agriculture and industry, and this
       impairment is recorded by the fossil record of the entire lake ecosystems. The most commonly studied 
       lacustrine microfossils are the glassy remains of diatoms, but many other algae and their consumers—including
       microscopic invertebrates—preserve in the sediments, allowing entire food webs to be reconstructed. Pollen 
       grains and other remains of terrestrial organisms (including pathogens) that blow or wash into lakes link the
       surrounding catchment to the lake, allowing cause and effect to be shown between human activities including land
       clearing and the introduction of exotic species, and the impairment of lake ecosystems. Nutrient loading 
       (eutrophication) has several harmful effects on lakes, including the promotion of harmful algal blooms and 
       the production of anoxic “dead zones.” The associated risks to public health include those posed by harmful
       algal blooms to the municipal water supply of communities. These have drawn a great deal of attention, but
       the stresses placed on ecosystems are visible in the turnover in microfossil assemblages in lake sediments
       long before the impacts are felt directly by humans. For example, lakes in regions with little capacity to
       buffer against acid rain are stressed by mining and smelting ores and the burning of fossil fuels—especially
       sulfur-rich coal. Increased acidity mobilizes toxins, making them bioavailable, and this can be seen in deformities
       in the fossil record of aquatic organisms preserved in the sediments that accumulate in the quiet depths of lake 
       basins. In the best cases, when water does not mix to the lakebed, the past is recorded as annual or even seasonal 
       layers, so that a year-by-year chronicle can be read over thousands of years. These layers of sediment, called
       varves, can be recovered using freeze cores, hollow metal tubes filled with a slurry of dry ice and ethanol 
       that instantly freezes a rind of lake sediment into which it is pushed, and they can be subsampled and analysed
       to provide annual resolution for chemical, physical or biological constituents of the lake’s sediment archive.

Some of the most substantial evidence of human impact on life that the AWG is investigating is preserved in the 
  skeletons of corals. Coral reefs have seen massive declines in recent years following coral bleaching events triggered 
  by rapid ocean warming. Significant modifications to coral reef communities in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries
  have also been caused by damaging cyclones, spikes in predators, and increased sediment delivery to reefs (Zinke et al. 2018). 

</p>

<p id="P20”>

Knowing how reef ecologies responded to past environmental change (including past mass extinction events) might provide 
       insights to future patterns (Leinfelder 2019). Some living reefs thrive in muddy and silty conditions, often in 
       nutrient-rich shallow waters that still resemble the habitats of ancient reefs. With extensive mitigation including
       preventing overfishing, coastal pollution, and urbanization—and above all, reducing greenhouse gas emissions—coral 
       reefs can continue to grow, albeit in a different form, and possibly thrive well into the future.

</p>

<p id="P21”>
Recent coral skeletons also preserve a record of environmental change over hundreds of years, and at a resolution of weeks
  to months, which makes them the prime archive in tropical oceans. They also record nuclear fallout from weapons testing,
  pollution, sedimentation, acidification, sea surface saltiness, temperature changes, and changes in skeletal chemistry 
  attributed to the uptake of atoms of carbon derived from the burning of fossil fuels. Corals then offer a high precision 
  tool for establishing when the Anthropocene began (Waters et al. 2018). 

</p>

<p id="P22”>
Because thousands of different species both on the land and in the sea have been translocated across the Earth, and because 
       there are myriad other geological signals by which to build a chain of correlation, the fossil record of the Anthropocene
       in a coral reef can be linked with records from around the world, including those in colder and deeper waters where
       coralline algae take over as precise recorders of environmental change. Coralline algae are particularly sensitive
       proxies of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), which is important for understanding atmosphere-ocean interactions.
       Although there are no instrumental records of DIC prior to the 1970s, a coralline alga from the cold Labrador Sea 
       provides an annually resolved continuous record of DIC variability back to the year 1740 CE. This shows an 
       increasing influence of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from the 1960s (Hou et al. 2019). The specific 
       proxy measured is the relative amount of two isotopes of carbon, 12C and 13C, denoted as a ratio ‘δ13C’ within 
       the skeletal carbonate of the alga. The amount is influenced by anthropogenic emissions of CO2 that are characterized
       by isotopically light carbon (12C). Some of this isotopically distinctive CO2 having been discharged into the
       atmosphere then dissolves into the oceans where it is taken up by the algae (and by corals as well). A multiple site
       record of δ13C from coralline algae in the Arctic Ocean, meanwhile, reflects variations in sea-ice cover back to the 
       fourteenth century, with a long-term decline since the 1850s probably reflecting industrial-era warming (Halfar et al. 
       2013). In this case, the δ13C reflects changes in the primary production of photosynthetic plankton in the waters which
       are influenced by the annual duration of sea ice cover. Because photosynthetic plankton preferentially use the lighter
       isotope of carbon, the ambient waters become enriched in the heavier 13C that the coralline algae then incorporate into 
       their carbonate skeletons.

</p>

<h3>Different paths to the future</h3>

<p id="P23”>
How might the paleontological signal of the Anthropocene appear to a future geologist? In the near future, as human impacts on 
  the biosphere grow, millions of species may be lost, which would be evident as an abrupt change in the species preserved as 
  fossils in the sedimentary deposits of the Anthropocene. For humans and most of the current biosphere this record will represent 
  a catastrophe. Surviving humans, perhaps the great-grandchildren of today’s children, will live in a world with degraded 
  ecosystems, a world with dramatically diminished land- and seascapes. These patterns are already emerging. Oil palm has 
  exploded across the tropical island of Borneo, whilst the Great Barrier Reef has suffered unprecedented damage in the early 
  twenty-first century. 
</p>

<p id="P24”>
An alternative fossil record is grounded in a more harmonious relationship with the biosphere. In a world in which we act fast 
       to avert a mass extinction event, the fossil record would still preserve the basal Anthropocene horizon, already evident
       by the many species we have moved across the world, but this would soon be followed by a paleontological record of recovery
       , as ecologies repair themselves. This alternative future can become reality: some human cultures are pathfinders for 
       a more sympathetic relationship with the biosphere. They include the indigenous peoples of Haida Gwaii (British Columbia),
       who use their coastal ecosystems in a sustainable manner (Eckert et al. 2018). They live alongside their aquatic neighbors
       without exhausting them. At the global level, effective approaches to maintain biodiversity will require trans-national
       cooperation, a shift to carbon-neutral energy production, and a concerted effort to save many species on the brink. All of
       these approaches are feasible, if humans have the will.
