The Anthropocene Working Group is preparing the case for the definition of a new stratigraphic Epoch: this requires the 
  demonstration of an objective change in properties of a geological archive over time. As each property being examined for this 
  distinction can be considered as a time series, we encounter a classic scientific problem of distinguishing a signal from noise. 
  We need to understand the reasons why a signal of change should exist in order to know how to look for it—for example, in what 
  chemical form would a new pollutant emerge? We also need a theory (a model) of the noise—over time, how large are the natural 
  background fluctuations, and what are their properties? A familiar example of this challenge is the tricky problem of 
  distinguishing long-term climate change from the background of weather events. In this essay we examine these issues with 
  respect to several chemical signals of environmental change which reflect global (anthro-)(bio-)geochemical cycles. To 
  begin, we see what can be learned from the extensive measurements of sea-level change: an instructive example for a 
  high-quality source of data with considerable noise in terms of geographic variation.
</p>

<h3>Variations across time and space: Sea-level change</h3>

<p id="P2”>
Today, much of the world’s human population lives in the coastal areas at densities about three times higher than 
       the global average. As these coastal environments are extensively reclaimed for agriculture, urbanization, 
       and industry, sea-level rise is an existential threat to many communities. Systematic observations of the 
       height of water at the coastline began in Amsterdam in 1682 and computations of mean sea level became possible 
       when automatic tide gauges, which allowed continuous water height measurements, were invented in the 1930s. Sea 
       level at a given location represents the mean height of the water surface relative to the underlying geological 
       substrate. Establishing this mean requires time-averaging myriad fluctuations related to climatic and geophysical 
       factors (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). Tides, for example, display a range of variabilities on longer timescales 
       than the familiar diurnal variation, and year-to-year variations in storminess can be significant sources of noise. 
       While tide gauges provide data that is highly precise and accurate in relation to time and space, their signal is local, 
       and as we examine below, their noise is related to geographic variations. 
</p>

<p id="P3”>
To understand sea level prior to the late twentieth century when tide gauges were widespread, we must use geological data. 
  Salt marsh sediments contain microfossils whose narrow height distribution within the tidal range is delimited by modern 
  studies. The sediments can be dated by radiometric analyses (14C, 210Pb) and the use of stratigraphic markers of pollutants, 
  including metals, rare isotopes from atmospheric nuclear test measurements, and human-made pollutants. The resulting records 
  of a proxy for sea level have a precision of ±5 years in the twentieth century and a vertical resolution within ±5 cm (Summerhayes 
  and Cearreta 2019).
</p>

<p id="P4”>
The primary anthropogenic disturbance to the pre-existing long-term trends in sea level is the emission of greenhouse gases. Since 
       the mid-twentieth century, 90 percent of all carbon used to date by humans was consumed to drive the huge recent industrial development 
       (Syvitski et al. 2020). Consequently, the lower atmosphere warmed 1.2°C, the ocean increased its temperature, most mountain glaciers are 
       retreating, and both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are losing mass: accordingly, the global sea level rose 30 cm (Summerhayes 
       and Cearreta 2019). Sea-level change is one of the most important consequences of the Quaternary (last 2.6 million years) climate 
       variability, as the sea level decreases during glacial intervals and increases during interglacial phases. Comparing the tide-gauge 
       and geological records shows that the speed of recent sea-level rise in the post-glacial interval has recently increased. Relatively 
       low global rates of increase during the last 7,000 years (average <1 mm/year) transitioned upwards in the twentieth century and are 
       currently >3 mm/year (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). Global average sea levels are currently higher than at any time in the last 115,000 
       years, after the end of the previous interglacial phase. 
</p>

<p id="P5”>
We now know the direct causes of this change precisely because of the advent of satellite monitoring complemented by accurate surface 
  devices (such as autonomous floats) in the ocean. Measurements of the absolute height of the ocean surface began with the launch of 
  TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992, and were later enhanced by the GRACE satellite mission, which uses measurements of gravity to understand ice 
  mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers. The absolute contribution of melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to sea-level 
  rise has increased since the early 1990s while expansion of the surface layer of the ocean due to warming has also accelerated (IPCC 2019). 
</p>

<p id="P6”>
The timing of the measured sea-level inflections matches, with a delay of about a decade, the stepped changes in atmospheric 
       carbon dioxide concentrations (Summerhayes and Cearreta 2019). Additional noise in the time domain of the calculated global 
       mean trends of sea level is observed to coincide with volcanic eruptions (negative deviations) and the 2016 Super El Niño and 
       2011 La Niña events (positive and negative deviations, respectively), as can be seen in the Global Mean Sea Level chart provided 
       by the University of Colorado. Other processes, such as ocean dynamics, tectonics, or glacial isostatic adjustment are spatially 
       variable and cause sea-level rise to vary (usually very slowly) in rate and magnitude between different regions. Local and 
       regional changes in these climatic and geophysical factors produce significant deviations from a global average rate of 
       sea-level change (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). These dynamics are well illustrated by the interactive graphics at the Permanent 
       Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) based at the National Oceanography Centre in Liverpool.

Europe is a continent well-furnished with tide gauges since the beginning of the twentieth century. Their data reveal large 
  regional variations, primarily associated with rising land in Scandinavia where rebound effects from the last ice age are 
  still in progress. Using data from recent decades, the reduction in sea-level fall in these areas and the increase in rise 
  elsewhere is clear. By contrast, Australia’s trends in the early decades of the twentieth century cannot be reliably established
  because of the lack of monitoring sites. However, over the last three decades, the rising trend is unequivocal, including in 
  areas such as coastal South Australia which are characterized by long-term uplift of the land.
</p>

<p id="P8”>
The latest IPCC projections (2019) predict an average rise in the sea level at the end of the twenty-first century of 
       28–57 cm in a scenario of drastic reduction in greenhouse effect emissions, and of 55–140 cm if there is growth in 
       emissions (Figure 1). The spread within the forecasts reflects the uncertainties that exist about the future behaviour 
       of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.
</p>

<h3>Climate signals in ice cores: Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes</h3>

<p id="P9”>
Certain elements and their isotopes (atoms of the same element differing in mass) can be used as geochemical tracers of anthropogenic
  impact. Our understanding of the extent to which ice sheets have waxed and waned in the past has come from the geochemistry of oxygen
  isotopes, originating from the work of the chemist and Nobel laureate Harold Urey in the late 1940s. Workers have traditionally used 
  mass spectrometry to make extremely precise measurements of the ratio of abundance of a rare isotope such as 18O (spoken as oxygen-18
  ) to a common isotope such as 16O on a gas produced in the laboratory from the material (e.g. water or calcium carbonate). The ratios
  are normally expressed as the delta value, e.g. δ18O, a number in parts per thousand (‰) expressing the relative abundance of 18O to
  16O. Lower delta values mean both less 18O as seen in water vapor compared with its source water, and in a progressively greater lowering 
  of 18O in rain and snow from cooling air masses. Hence ice sheets, primarily formed from evaporation from sea water, have very low delta
  values which, during an ice age, lead to a higher δ18O value of the remaining seawater. The larger the mass of ice, the larger this
  ice-volume effect. When considering oxygen in seashells, there is also a temperature effect on the composition of precipitated calcium
  carbonate shells which reinforces the ice-volume effect, as classically demonstrated from deep ocean cores by Sir Nicholas Shackleton
  in 1967. As a result, the long-term stratigraphy of the Quaternary ice ages is framed by oxygen isotope stages which alternate between 
  cold glacial and warmer interglacial intervals, and we know that in glacial stages, the global temperature averaged 4–6°C below present
  values but was 9–11°C below present values in Antarctica.
</p>

<p id="P10”>
Although a (small) oxygen isotope (δ18O) signal does mark the base of our current interglacial period (the Holocene) in a Greenland 
       ice core, the subsequent variations are more subtle and below the 0.5–1°C sensitivity of the oxygen isotope proxy. Consequently, 
       an assemblage of temperature proxies is used, rather than just oxygen isotopes, to establish Holocene temperature archives. When
       it comes to the mid-twentieth century proposed start for the Anthropocene, there is no discrete (δ18O) signal in oxygen isotope
       archives, even in the relatively sensitive Antarctic records. In fact, the gradual increase in the rate of temperature change makes
       it difficult to define an Anthropocene boundary on the basis of any geochemical proxy for temperature. This problem is also the 
       basis for the struggle (now largely won) to convince politicians and the public of the reality of warming (also known as the 
       “boiling frog syndrome” of inattentiveness to gradual risk increases).
</p>

<p id="P11”>
The increasing rate of change in temperature in recent decades does, however, lead to measurable changes in Antarctic ice-core 
  records. Hydrogen isotopes show covariation with oxygen and with temperature, so measuring both elements provide a more robust
  measure of past temperatures. To avoid local effects, the most reliable signals are reached through the combination of multiple
  ice-core records from a given site and/or region, and through the site-specific calibration of the relationships between water-stable
  isotopes and temperature (Stenni et al., 2017), which has been carried out under an international project identifying several discrete
  regions of Antarctica that exhibit somewhat different climate signals (Figure 2). Temperature reconstructions based on the isotopic
  data showed warming in recent years in three of these regions. In each case the temperature increase began around 1920 and continued
  to the latest available measurements (ca. 2005) with rates of warming between 1 and 2°C/100 years. These increases followed substantial
  declines in temperature that lasted over the previous 2,000 years. However, relative to the variability of the climate signal in the
  rest of Antarctica for the past 2,000 years, only the rise in temperature of the Antarctic Peninsula is unusual. It seems reasonable 
  to assume that because of its more northerly aspect, the Peninsula is subject to a slightly different climatic regime than most of the 
  continent, and one that is closely connected to the global warming identified elsewhere on the planet. Close inspection of the isotopic 
  temperature signal for the Peninsula suggests greater warming after about 1970 than between 1920 and 1970, much as is found in the global
  surface temperature signal. It seems likely, then, that the Peninsula temperature signal reflects gradual warming after 1900, followed by 
  steeper warming after 1970, as on the rest of the globe.

<h3>The carbon cycle and sulphur in the atmosphere</h3>

<p id="P12”>
A primary driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels which have created a first-order change in the carbon cycle. Fluxes
       of carbon between reservoirs have increased, and carbon, mainly as carbon dioxide, is increasingly stored in the atmosphere. 
       This newly released carbon has a distinct fingerprint in terms of the ratio of the stable isotopes of carbon (13C/12C) as determined
       from mass spectrometry. Expressed in terms of the delta number (δ13C), the rare 13C is much less abundant in the biosphere (δ13C
       around -25‰), and thus in fossil fuels that stem from organic material, than in the pre-industrial atmosphere (-6.5‰). Hence 
       atmospheric CO2 trapped in ice cores shows an inverse relationship to δ13C, known as the Suess effect, with a pronounced inflection
       around 1965 CE. This signal in ice cores shows little noise because it reflects the composition of a well-mixed atmosphere. It 
       therefore compares in quality with that of radioactive species such as radiocarbon and plutonium released through atmospheric
       nuclear tests. Carbon isotopes in other archives typically show a less clear-cut relationship because of the complexities of 
       biochemical cycling. For example, this signal is masked altogether in cave carbonates (speleothems) because of large fractionations
       in carbon isotopes in cave systems. Trees provide an interesting intermediate example where, although the carbon fixed is derived 
       directly from the atmosphere, seasonal to decadal changes in tree physiology add noise to the Suess effect. However, in the dataset 
       shown below (from Loader et al., 2013) a moving average of the data reveals the underlying atmospheric signal, with an inflection 
       around 1960 CE. Marine records, such as from corals, also demonstrate a clear signal (Figure 3). 
</p>

<p id="P13”>
A contrasting example is provided by sulphur in the atmosphere. It is released naturally from volcanic eruptions, but emissions
  increased enormously because of industrial processes, particularly the burning of sulphurous coal. Because this sulphur is in 
  the form of microscopic aerosol particles, the abundance of sulphur in geological archives and its stable isotope composition
  show regional variations (Fairchild 2019). For example, trees and speleothems in Europe show a mid-twentieth century rise followed 
  by a fall reflecting changes in this industrial activity. These records rely on micro-scale analytical techniques at specialized
  facilities, such as ion probes or the fluorescence produced by X-rays in huge synchrotron facilities. Both are anthrobiogeochemical 
  records since the O and S isotopes in sulphate in rainfall become fractionated when stored in soil humic substances. This pollution
  indicator is also seen as an anthrogeochemical (i.e. non-biological) signal in Greenland ice, but is absent in Antarctic ice cores.
</p>

<h3>The nitrogen cascade</h3>

<p id="P14”>
The modern nitrogen cycle is a typical anthrobiogeochemical cycle because human activities have led to substantial changes in
       natural processes governing nitrogen fixation, its bioavailability, and its overall fate in the environment the production 
       of fertilizer through the synthesis of ammonia from atmospheric N2 (Haber-Bosch process) and its use in agriculture since 
       the beginning of the twentieth century constitute one of the most important sources of anthropogenic perturbations of 
       the nitrogen cycle, along with the burning of fossil fuels and symbiotic nitrogen fixation by bacteria hosted by cultivated plants. 
</p>

<p id="P15”>
An excess of nitrogen causes a negative impact on all environmental compartments. In surface waters it brings about eutrophication,
  leads to a deficit in oxygen (hypoxia) into the sea, and a decreased input of dissolved silica soils, excessive amounts of nitrogen 
  cause acidification and decreased biodiversity. It also diminishes the quality of air through the formation of particulate matter
  and ozone. The above examples of complex environmental impacts are often referred to as a “nitrogen cascade.” 
</p>

<p id="P16”>
Nitrogen has two stable isotopes, 14N and 15N, with 14N making up 99.63 percent of all nitrogen occurring in nature. Anthropogenic
       sources produce a change of nitrogen stable isotope ratios in different environmental archives. This change may potentially
       be used as a signal of the Anthropocene. Sample analysis is again by mass spectrometry with preparation techniques tailored 
       to create gas for analysis from materials such as organic matter or ice. The increase in concentrations of nitrogen compounds 
       in the environment, especially from fossil fuel burning, is usually accompanied by a decrease in δ15N values. For example, 
       the differences in δ15N values of nitrate recorded in a Greenland ice core in the past 150 years was as high as 12‰, decreasing
       from +11‰ to −1‰. Similar patterns of δ15N values were found in analyses of total nitrogen in organic carbon from dated
       lake sediments collected from 25 remote and nutrient-poor lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. The present δ15N value of ∼8‰ 
       recorded in North Pacific deep-sea corals is the lowest it has been during the last 5,000 years. In many environmental archives, 
       the rate of decline in the δ15N value has accelerated and become pronounced, but there are also reports of enrichment in 15N in
       natural archives during recent decades. In coral skeletons from the Pearl River estuary in China, for example, relatively stable
       δ15N values (a range of 9 to 12‰) were recorded in the skeletons dated from the mid-Holocene to the 1980s, followed by an increase
       to >13‰ during 1987–1993 CE and later a decline to the pre-1980s values. The increase observed in the late 1980s/early 1990s was
       caused by a growing input of sewage to the Pearl River estuary (Figure 4). Nitrification (oxidation of NH4+ from sewage to nitrites
       and nitrates) and subsequent denitrification (reduction of nitrates to N2O and N2) caused an increase in the δ15N values because
       the products of denitrification were enriched in the lighter N isotope, whereas the remaining inorganic N species were enriched
       in 15N. It is fortunate that despite the complexities of the biogeochemical cycling of different nitrogen species, both the 
       nitrogen isotope records of nitrate and the organic carbon fraction reflect environmental change. The observed trends in the 
       δ15N values of different environmental archives reflect a combination of natural- and human-driven processes, thus confirming 
       the usefulness of stable nitrogen isotopes for our understanding of anthrobiogeochemical nitrogen cycles. 
</p>

<h3>The legacy of lead</h3>

<p id="P17”>
Trace metals are integral parts of natural element cycles and, before human interference, came mainly from geo-/lithogenic sources via 
  the weathering of rocks. We focus here on lead (Pb), as it is relatively common in the Earth’s crust (average 14 ppm) compared to
  other trace metals, has been widely mined or formed a by-product of mining since prehistoric times, and is identified as a highly 
  toxic element, making the monitoring of Pb contamination as well as searches for its provenance a critical issue in geological, 
  environmental, and public research. Beginning as early as thousands of years BCE, the increased availability of anthropogenic trace 
  metals in the environment, and thus their involvement in anthrobiogeochemical cycles, began with the mining of ores and other raw
  materials for use in various industrial processes: initially lead was merely a by-product, and only later was mined directly. 
</p>

<p id="P18”>
Many different techniques are used to determine total Pb concentrations in samples, and the analytical precision of these techniques 
       is far less than the sample-to-sample variation. Ratios of stable isotopes such as 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb analyzed by different
       types of mass spectrometry can be used to distinguish the sources of contamination by lead in the environment, e.g. in assessing
       the relative contributions from mining against natural background values (e.g. Gałuszka and Wagreich 2019). Natural background
       fluctuations vary across orders of magnitude, driven by local high-lead sources like ores, variabilities in input from weathering,
       and sediment dilution. Remote archives such as ice sheets largely show inputs of natural dust particles, contaminated by 
       anthropogenic emissions such as those from lead in petrol. Because ice sheets are remote, background concentrations of Pb
       in Arctic and Antarctic ice cores range from a few to a few tens of parts-per thousand, whereas in other archives, such as 
       lakes and bogs, natural background concentrations are mainly around tens of parts-per million (Gałuszka and Wagreich 2019).
</p>

<p id="P19”>
The earliest regional to supra-regional peaks of aerosol Pb (a by-product of silver mining and smelting processes) can be 
  identified in Northern Hemisphere ice cores from Greenland and Arctic Canada, and are linked to Phoenician-Greek mining 
  and smelting activities some 3,000 years ago (Figure 5). This minor peak in some environmental archives of the Northern Hemisphere
  was identified as a possible stratigraphic marker for an early Anthropocene (Wagreich and Draganits 2018).
</p>

<p id="P3”>
Later, silver, and thus also lead, mining and usage increased substantially during Roman times, which lead to significant human
       health problems. This usage is recorded in archives by a widespread lead peak, more pronounced than the earlier one, and
       is recognized in ice cores, estuaries, bogs, and remote lakes of the Northern Hemisphere; a Spanish source for the lead was 
       revealed by isotope studies (Wagreich and Draganits 2018).
</p>

<p id="P20”>
Global lead production and usage only began to rise again with silver production in medieval times. This was followed by an even 
  larger rise due to silver mining and production in the New World, with abundant production and use punctuated by plagues and wars.
  The Industrial Revolution brought a major rise in lead production and left a peak in archives around 1850–1890 CE that was much 
  larger than the Roman peak. The Australian Broken Hill lead signal beginning around the 1850s onward formed the first peak in 
  Antarctic ice cores. Final peak usage and global environmental contamination was reached during the mid-twentieth century, when
  lead was used as an antiknock additive for petrol in the increasingly fossil-fuel driven transport system. This last peak, being 
  in several geological archives an order of magnitude higher than the former more regional peaks of lead usage, provides a marker 
  for the Great Acceleration. Although it was not as pronounced as are other chemical markers around the 1950s, the lead peak was 
  very distinct and globally distributed on both land and oceans. Due to the eventual recognition of its toxic behaviour, lead as 
  a petrol additive was banned in more and more countries, starting in the USA and Europe from the 1970s onwards. The recent widespread
  Pb expulsion, then, began to increase in the 1920s, peaked in the late 1960s, and declined from the late 1970s onward, arriving at 
  today’s intermediate to high values of contamination and fluxes of lead in the Earth system (Gałuszka and Wagreich 2019).
</p>

<h3>The Anthropocene signal amidst the noise</h3>

<p id="P21”>
The large amounts of industrially-produced pollutants and emissions that have been introduced, over decades and centuries, 
       into air, soil, and water have caused considerable changes to natural phenomena, such as the cycling of elements and 
       changes in sea level. However, the Anthropocene signals lie amidst noise which arises for several reasons. One is the 
       issue in making measurements with sufficient precision (easy for tide gauges, but tricky for some rare isotopes). Another 
       is the geographic variability of many parameters. A third is the presence of natural variability over time. Despite these 
       problems, many different types of anthropogenic signals have become increasingly prominent and isolatable since the middle 
       of the twentieth century.
