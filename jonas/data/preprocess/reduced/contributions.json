In the stories she tells about the place where we both grew up, the Mississippi River is not the origin of life, but a point in time and space where she narrowly escaped death.  When my mother was barely thirteen, her brothers tossed her from the riverbank into moving water.  A half-century later, she can still taste mud and feel her body being pulled by the current, moving her away from home against her will. // The Mississippi did not consume my mother. Instead, it carried her body to deadfall\u2014a tangled mass of branches washed into the river by rain. This raft gave her something to grasp, suspended her at the surface. It held her there until her limbs ran aground on a sandbar.  In her telling of this story, she then clawed her way up the bank, hanging onto the roots of a willow tree. // My mother doesn\u2019t tell her story this way: The trees saved her. The river swept her away, but it also moved her safely to shore.  Her brothers tossed her in, but it was the Mississippi that showed her how to survive. // I first learned the River as something to fear. As a girl, I was taught to leave it be. To respect how fast it moves and its unseen depths. To know the power of water to take life\u2014but not to give it. I heard stories of the ways it can flood and ruin the things we\u2019ve built\u2014but not much about the river as our reason for being here. // Be wary of muddy edges. Worry your way through change. // When I tell my mother\u2019s story to other women\u2014particularly women with roots in rural places, close to water\u2014they almost always recall a similar experience.  The time their brother or father or another man tossed them into water.  The time they nearly drowned because they did not heed a mother\u2019s advice.\u00a0 How they survived submersion, barely. What this fear meant for their path into the wider world, all the ways they learned to stand by and watch\u2014to stay safe on shore.\u00a0 // How many women are pulled into life this way? Denied the power of water to live life, and taught instead to fear it? //\u00a0 I wanted to be near the river, because the river was where I was told not to go.  It was a place of ghosts as well as our garbage.  It contained the possibility of death, and also a kind of immortality. The river was where stories had sudden endings, which meant no end at all. Young men or women, who did not survive drowning, were trapped forever in their cars, always drunk or doing something they shouldn\u2019t do.  They died of water, or of ice.  And in that way, they lived on as local legends, more real to me than the long gone men whose names were on plaques in our City Hall.",

For some, it was somewhere to dump broken appliances, old mattresses and other furniture, and farm machines that no longer served a purpose once the farms went under. It was also a place for women who did not know theirs. They haunted us with their warnings: Stay out of trouble.\u00a0 //\u00a0 But I knew that away was where I wanted to go, so the River was my favorite place. It was the place where I went the night I drank alcohol for the first time, sitting on the bank with my cousin\u2014both of us retelling stories our mothers had told us about the drown girls. It was where I went the first time I kissed a boy, under the river bridge, where mosquitos bit every place our skin was bare. I went swimming in the river too, once I\u2019d learned how. First with cousins, then with cabin boys from the Cities. I felt the thrill of being carried away\u2014cool mud between my toes, crawling back up the same way as my mother\u2014except I had chosen this. // Palisade, the town where we grew up, was only home to 113 people by the time I knew it. It\u2019s not far from the headwaters in northern Minnesota, and about 1,000 miles from the river\u2019s mouth. The name Palisade refers to an embankment and, for some people, this conjures the vistas of Palisade Head on the north shore of Lake Superior, a place people go to view the expanse of that inland sea. If you look up the town of Palisade on Instagram, you\u2019ll find countless photos mistakenly geotagged, smiling people at the edge of a cliff, the horizon fading behind them. \u00a0 The Palisade where I grew up had no vistas. It was a riverine swamp, with a small rise in the land imperceptible to most people, where a railroad could make a water crossing. // The origin of the town of Palisade is a railroad bridge. It\u2019s a place that was built so the Soo Line could cross the Mississippi.  This crossing made it possible to move things that were being extracted from surrounding land (timber, iron ore) not only north to south by water, but east and west by rail. Those industries of extraction are also what made it possible for my family to settle there.  Today, Palisade is also where the Canadian oil company Enbridge is seeking permits to cross beneath the river, so they can move oil from the Alberta tar sands to a refinry on the shores of Lake Superior.  //\u00a0 I was born in 1982, the year before the railroad stopped running through town. By the time I arrived, the population had declined significantly. Most of the buildings my mother and grandmother had known were vacant or torn down. \u00a0 In the 1980s, Aitkin County was the poorest county in the state of Minnesota. Many families here did not have indoor plumbing. //  My mom and her family were among a handful of settlers who stayed in Palisade after the busts of the timber industry and the mines on the Cuyuna Range. After the county stopped clearing ditches. After the farms flooded back to swamp. After the railroad stopped running and no one used the river to move things anymore. Growing up here, I always had the sense I was living \u201cafter\u201d a place had stopped. I knew from the stories we were told that for a time this was a real town.  I had no sense of what came before that. // I knew native people, had cousins who were \u201cChippewa\u201d\u2019 from nearby reservations\u2014but never understood that this was Anishinaabe or Ojibwe land we were occupying. The place I knew as a \u201cpalisade\u201d for the Soo Line Railroad was written on birchbark scrolls as the confluence of two rivers, what we call the Mississippi and the Willow. According to Ojibwe tribal attorney Frank Bibeau,Frank Bibeau, Presentation at the Kickoff of the Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project. it was the place between places\u2014a portage connecting the headwaters region to Gigchigami (Lake Superior) and beyond. The entire area where I grew up is subsumed in treaties that predate the State of Minnesota, a territory that remains for Ojibwe people to hunt, fish, and gather in perpetuity.Great Lakes Indian Fish &amp; Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC): https://www.glifwc.org/TreatyRights/treaties.html // In the Palisade Fire Hall there is a glass case they call the town\u2019s Museum. In it, photographs and newspaper clippings from the past century tell the stories of settler families\u2014including mine\u2014and how we occupied that wet and remote place. Among them are stories of floods, frequent inundations that happened each time the river remembered that its current course is always temporary.  The nature of that river is to whip and wind. //\u00a0 Several articles in the Museum feature photographs of the time Palisade was completely surrounded by water, a temporary island.  All of the groceries had to be brought in by boat. Sick people, and those working elsewhere in the forest or the mines, had to be moved in and out the same way. For months, the families that lived here were living in the movement of water, river people after all.\u00a0 //\u00a0 There is also a story from that same era, when the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in Palisade.  Thousands of people came from across Northeastern Minnesota to hear a man from Duluth equate white supremacy\u2014over black people, Jewish people, and darker-skinned Eastern Europeans\u2014with patriotism and economic security. The article mentions how many cars lined the river road. It says nothing about the Indigenous peoples who\u2019d been displaced here, and yet were still living; or the fact that at the time, my grandfather, and others like him, who had recently migrated here to work in the mines, were not considered \u201cwhite\u201d either. They were in the process of becoming white.  // There are no stories in this Museum about the Ojibwe people who have and still reside on this river, or about what the riparian landscape was like before there was a town here. Before the railroad. Before us.\u00a0 // In the 1990s, when the rights of Ojibwe people to hunt, fish, and gather here were being reaffirmed in court, white hunters and fishermen put up signs on their land warning that they would shoot \u201cIndians\u201d if they trespassed, calling them \u201cspear-chuckers\u201d and much worse. I remember hearing these slurs around my grandparents\u2019 dinner table. I imagined my uncles with guns chasing \u201cIndians\u201d through the woods, or bringing a human body home the way they brought home the animals they\u2019d killed, which hung from trees to bleed. // Today, these memories, and the way they seemed so normal at that time, are horrifying to me, yet it seems wrong to pretend they were not part of our universe\u2014the way we made sense of this river and this place. Our river, the world as we knew it, was only possible because of the ones we displaced, denied, or erased\u2014violently. That we displace, deny, and erase still\u2014violently. On that point, most of the white people I grew up with still maintain that we could not have learned racism living in this small town all of those years, because everyone was white.\u00a0 // My mother\u2019s story, about being thrown into the river by her brothers, and surviving on a tangle of tree branches, is also nowhere in the Museum of our river town.  Her story survives, as most do, in the space between people who whisper to one another: This is who we are.\u00a0 This is what we fear the most. This is how we have survived. //",

                "text": "I eventually learned how to swim. I wasn\u2019t thrown into water, but was given an inner tube from an old tractor, and pushed gently from the sloping side of a gravel pit into the middle of a deep quarry lake. My mom thought it was safer to swim here, because the water didn\u2019t move. You couldn\u2019t see the bottom, but at least it was still. At least it was a hole we\u2019d made. That water was clear, and though we didn\u2019t know it, it connected directly to an underground river, the very aquifer we tapped for our drinking water. All along there was a river under the river. // I\u2019ve come to think of the place I grew up as a place where, if you\u2019re paying attention to the right stories, you can see the way different universes converge, with a turbulence that has a lot to teach us. There are many different rivers, all running over and under each other. // There is the river of our settler imagination: The one that begins at the railroad crossing and goes by the name and logic of a small embankment, as well as a fortress.Another definition for Palisade is a fortress: Outside of town, a group of Vietnam Veterans, calling themselves the Palisade Mountain Men has built a fortress and gathers here to reenact a romanticized version of \u201cfrontier times.\u201d That river is one of desire for control and conquest. A place to dredge and drain wetlands for farms. A place to take what we want, and to move it to where it can turn a profit. To draw maps that divide the county into saleable squares, giving each of them a name and owner. This is not exactly my grandfather\u2019s or my uncles\u2019 river. It belongs to the families \u201cout east\u201d who were the beneficiaries of this imagination, memorialized in historical museums by the sheer volume of what was extracted for profit. This is the river women like my mother are thrown into by force, and where so many bodies never surface. // That is the river of our mothers and grandmothers who never learned to swim, but who survived in spite of the violence into which they were plunged. The river of our fear. The river we are part of imagining, in our submersion into movement\u2014all that is unseen and cannot be controlled, as well as what we hold onto, and the grace life gives us. Somehow, we feel our way back to standing. We learn how to tend to changing relationships, to know the moods of water and other bodies, and we meet the river under the river. // And of course, there is the Ojibwe universe, or many. These are not for me to tell. // At the Kickoff to the Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project, Frank Bibeau, Dawn Goodwin, and others shared stories about the migration of Ojibwe people to and through this territory in canoes made of birch; and of the birchbark scrolls on which the rivers were threads connecting each body of water, not just lakes with names, but centers of a universe. Some of them, including the one many of us think of as \u201cthe source\u201d of the Mississippi, are known as false rivers. They do not begin where we might think, and are not easily traveled. // Frank laughed when we asked about the source of the river. How we seemed obsessed with beginnings and endings. // We trace routes that double as political borders or economic corridors, and draw those same boundaries on maps as well as on our hearts. What is the origin of our desire for a linear story? What is it about edges and crossings? // What if the submersions we\u2019ve survived are not about knowing beginnings and endings at all, but about finding meaning in the muck we meet between those worlds? Remembering that this moment is one source, unnameable. Learning to swim is movement within movement. What can you learn at the murky edge of a living river? // During the Kickoff to the Anthropocene River Journey, I explained to others what I believe it means to be Riverine: A riverine place, or a riverine person, is defined not by borders and boundaries, but by the mud she\u2019s wading into, all the water that moves through her, all the life that flourishes (or doesn\u2019t) there. A mud lark is someone who scavenges in river mud for things of value, which might be shards of porcelain, mussel shells, or her own life story. // When I\u2019m looking for meaning in my mother\u2019s stories\u2014the stories I was steeped in, which became my own, however incomplete\u2014I like to give them a quarter-turn, looking at them like a mud lark might look at glass that\u2019s been polished by the flow of water and what it carries: What does this piece mean? What can I make of this? What? // In the car, near the headwaters of the Mississippi, as we crossed that river several times without even noticing, I told JamieJamie Allen, &#8220;Head Waters at the Headwaters&#8221;: https://anthropocene-curriculum.org/contribution/head-waters-at-the-headwaters  and others who were with us about all the women I\u2019ve known who\u2019ve been thrown into rivers. I thought this might be a river story worth retelling. Sadie said, \u201cThose are really stories about turning against ourselves.\u201dSadie Lutmer, who was along to help document our journey, contributed much to my thinking about this. // How do we turn back? //\u00a0 What if, instead of crawling out and surviving, holding all the heavy lessons of fear and control\u2026 we return to the water, because it also contains life and pleasure.  What if it turns out we belong there?  What if we learn how to love letting ourselves go?",

When a strong wind blows, small things, like sand, can become airborne and travel huge distances.I learnt this fact from Bronislaw Szerszynski during the seminar, and, in the communication that followed after he had read a draft of this essay, he offered many suggestions concerning the distinction between floating and flying. He also indicated another couple of concepts similar to floating/flying like gliding/soaring. I learnt many other things about the mechanisms of floating and flying from an article he introduced me to: Jasper F. Kok, Eric J. R. Parteli, Timothy I. Michaels, and Diana Bou Karam, \u201cThe Physics of Wind-blown Sand and Dust,\u201d Reports on Progress in Physics, vol. 75, no. 10, 106901 (2012). The article is interesting; it deals not only with the phenomena of things that fly on Earth, but also things on Mars and the other planets that fly (or float). Imagine flying in Mars! I was reminded of Szerszynski\u2019s marvelous essay about the possible religion (Mangalayana Buddhism) in Mars in the twenty-second century. See Bronislaw Szerszynski, \u201cLiberation through Hearing in the Planetary Transition: Funerary practices in twenty-second-century Mangalayana Buddhism,\u201d in: Katrin Klingan, Ashkan Sepahvand, Christoph Rosol, and Bernd M. Scherer (eds), Grain Vapor Ray: Textures of the Anthropocene. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2015. I thank him for all of this. They splash when strong wind hits them and the aerodynamic lift exceeds the gravitational and inter-particle forces. Some small grains of sand move from the Sahara desert and reach the South American continent. Recent research points out that this kind of immigration of the sands enriches the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the sand particles fall back to the Earth before they can reach the continent. When sand drops into the Atlantic Ocean, it provides nutrition to the sea in that area. Sands of the deserts contain minerals, especially bio-available iron and phosphorus, and the fallen sand particles with minerals are the origins of the richness of the ocean. But such flying is only possible for small particles. I cannot take off in the wind (in normal conditions).",

Viviparous animals, animals with a womb, appeared in the Permian period of the Paleozoic era, 298.9\u2012252.2 million years ago, in which the Earth became gradually dry.

        "abstract": "This model, proposed by the economist Thomas Schelling in 1971, at the time addressed a very important, and current, political issue: how to explain racial segregation in American cities. Specifically, Schelling wondered whether segregation was necessarily the result of racism\u2014the prejudice of individuals of one race against those of another. Indeed, a frequently adopted mental model is that the overall state of segregation merely translates, by aggregation, the racism of individuals. If people actively wanted to live with others of a different color, or did not care at all about their race, then we should find that, globally, neighborhoods mix the different colors. Is this implicit model correct? In other words, does a global segregated state necessarily imply an individual preference for segregation?",

Each house can be occupied by a green or a red person, or be empty. As is usual in economics, we translate the preferences of people to their neighborhoods by a utility function, which can be arbitrarily chosen. In this example, I will use a function that reflects the fact that people have a strong preference (maximum value taken as one) for a mixed neighborhood\u2014that is to say in which as many reds as greens live. If there are more people of the same color, the value decreases to a value equal to 1/2 (half the maximum). If they find themselves in a neighborhood inhabited by a majority of people of another color, their utility becomes zero (reflecting strong displeasure). It is necessary to specify a last ingredient to determine fully the model, one that will give it its dynamics. We will assume that at every turn, say every day that passes, a resident is chosen at random, and we suggest that he moves into an empty place also chosen at random. This inhabitant then calculates, using his satisfaction function, if this move increases his satisfaction. If this is the case, he will agree to move; otherwise, he refuses and stays in place. Once the choice is made, another resident and another empty box are chosen, always randomly, and the procedure starts again. Our intuition tells us that, as everyone moves to improve their satisfaction, and this is maximal when neighborhoods are mixed, the city should become increasingly racially mixed. The interest of Schelling\u2019s model is to contradict this implicit modeling. Indeed, starting from a city in which people are randomly distributed and rolling out the simulation, we see that gradually the city becomes increasingly segregated, and this result is robust. With other physicists, we have managed to show mathematically that after a number of moves, for the satisfaction function presented here and for many other similar functions, it is certain that the city, in the end, will be segregated. To simplify, the explanation of the paradox is that when a person chooses to move, she considers only the variation of her own satisfaction, and does not consider that of her neighbors. Do the other residents she leaves or joins see their satisfaction increase or decrease? We show that, overall, average satisfaction decreases, because the loss of many agents affected by the move of one person does not offset the gain experienced by the person who moved. Yet, in this model governed by the individualism that is the norm in economics, the individual gain that dominates the dynamics inevitably leads to a disadvantageous social situation for everyone. What is the relevance of this simple model to real urban segregation\u2014which is a far more complex phenomenon than the model implies, of course, not least because it results from the preferences of individuals, but also because many other factors come into play, such as house prices, locality of schools, additional characteristics of people such as age or wealth, etc.? To answer this question, we must examine modeling in general. There are two essential steps for modeling. The first, which is the most difficult and the most important, is to adopt a perspective, a simplification of reality that allows you to tame it and turn it into a formal model that can then (and this is the second step) be solved with digital tools (the computer) or mathematics. The first step is always more or less arbitrary. Which entities are important, and with what characteristics, and, therefore, which variables are considered negligible? For example, Thomas Schelling has chosen to keep only the individual characteristics (the satisfaction of each person) that are supposed to depend solely on the ethnic composition of the area, assuming the function of satisfaction is immutable, and leaving aside many other factors, as seen above. We should realize that this step toward simplification is not a stopgap: the models are of interest only by way of the accuracy with which they choose the less important elements. We must forget the fantasy of the perfect model, which completely reproduces reality. It would be as useless as the famous map that is as great in size as the territory it depicts, described by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges in \u201cDel rigor en la ciencia.\u201d This is the price we pay in order for the model to become formally manipulable, and allow for predictions (realistic models) or to clarify our ideas (simplistic models). This is true of social models as well as for models of natural systems. What, then, is the interest of modeling? For realistic models, the answer is well known. It is about building a model, a prototype system, which is under study in order to manipulate it easily and make predictions. For social models, it is often helpful for policymakers to base their decisions on robust models that provide reliable predictions. Pushed to the limit, the idea would be to reach a rational policy at the last, freed from endless discussions. This idea is not new. We could go back to Plato and his Republic ruled by surveyors. However, what is the point of simple models that do not claim the ability to predict anything? There are two major advantages to this type of modeling: the obligation to explain the models that would otherwise remain implicit, and then their conceptual clarity, which enables us to understand what we do. To understand these two points, I shall go back to Schelling\u2019s segregation model. You might have in mind an implicit model that links the segregation observed at neighborhood level to individual preference for segregation. To put it simply: intuitively, the observation of racial segregation involves individual racism. By modeling formally, we have to specify this fuzzy idea, studying the effect of individual preferences on the choice of residence. We learn that this intuition is not reliable, that the overall effects of individual decisions are not always intuitive. More generally, this model shows rigorously that it is not enough to let economic agents pursue their own interests selfishly, to achieve, inevitably, by the grace of the free market, an optimal situation. Of course, the model says nothing about what is going on in the real economy. It just says (but it is interesting nonetheless) that, logically, individual profit does not necessarily mean social welfare. The educational interest of simple models is that, thanks to the small number of ingredients they contain, we can understand their results in detail, the causalities at work, without feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of realistic models. Thus, in Schelling\u2019s model, we understand that if the result of accumulated selfishness is bad socially, it is because the movements of individuals are made without considering their effect on their neighbors. We can study these effects in detail and show why they are stronger than the additional satisfaction obtained by the person who moves, leading to an overall negative effect. This ability to understand the causalities at work contrasts with the \u201cblack-box\u201d character of realistic models, where the complexity of the processes often prevents us from understanding the origin of specific results.",

In late November of 2014 over one hundred people gathered at the Anthropocene Campus at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) in Berlin to wrestle with all of this. The aspiration was to experiment with approaches that might help make novel sense of this novel moment. It was a multifarious, and at times frenetic, event. In a makeshift effort to capture something of its closing momentum I conducted in-person microinterviews with over 35 participants on the last day of the Campus, of which this zine is a selection.

Occasionally the river floods these places. \u2018Floods&#8217; is the word they use, but in fact it is not flooding; it is remembering. \u2014 Toni Morrison What is that, a river? On the map it is just a snaking blue line which connects the northern USA with the ocean in the south, and written alongside it in small letters: Mississippi. The Mississippi is one of the largest river systems on earth. However, the river, once the epitome of the vast wilderness of the North American continent is now just a shadow of its former self. Its banks have been built on and straightened, the wild beauty has disappeared behind dikes. Its water is polluted. The region around the mouth of the river is occupied by huge oxygen-less death zones. Man treats the Mississippi like thousands of other rivers, forests, mountains, lakes, and coasts throughout the world. Unfortunately, the fate of the Mississippi is nothing special. However, what is unusual is that it also tells a different story, one of hope and a new departure. While the water flows from its source in Lake Itasca down to the Gulf of Mexico, as it has done for many millennia, people on its banks have taken up the struggle. They are fighting with new weapons. What they want is no less than a revolution for nature. It is not just classic environmental activists protesting against pollution and the building of new pipelines (that too), but scientists, lawyers, philosophers, and above all Native Americans who are fighting for an idea: They want to give the Mississippi rights. A legal status like a person, a company, or an association. Then it would be possible to call to account all those that exploit, pollute, abuse, and damage the Mississippi. The idea of defining rights for the world around us is just a few decades old. However, the idea of treating nature respectfully is as old as humanity itself. In the words of Nancy Beaulieu from the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, who live close to the source: \u201cThe Mississippi is alive like all of us. And it belongs to all of us.\u201d She is fighting, along with Robert Blake, a member of the Red Lake Nation, who says: \u201cLet us begin to protect the Mississippi and to take care of him,\u00a0 as he looked after us all these years.\u201d The activists call on the 3,700 kilometer long river to be understood as a living whole, with the right to exist, to grow and develop. As it is not just a collection of ecosystem services but a general good worthy of preservation. They want to anchor these rights in law. The protection of the Mississippi should be enforceable before a court. The idea is revolutionary because it provides a fundamentally different definition of the relationship between man and nature compared to all other legal texts on the planet. The movement that demands rights for nature does not ask what humans can demand of a river. Instead it is about what people can achieve for a river, a forest, or a lake.",

It flows through the middle of the million-strong conurbations, restrained by bank walls, spanned by bridges. Where the Mississippi touches downtown Minneapolis its subjugation is total. In the middle of the city are the Saint Anthony Falls. Once they used to wander upstream from year to year as the current slowly eroded the soft substratum. For the Native Americans, who first settled here 9,000 years ago, the waterfalls were a sacred site, for the whites, just an obstruction. They built their mills beside the river to grind wheat. For this they needed a strong, even current\u2014not shifting rapids. They concreted the river bed, built dams and locks, erected dikes, and robbed the Mississippi of its wild freedom. The subjugation of the city made the city rich. Natural destruction is a crime Up until now, nature, in terms of the law, has only been an object, not a subject. Once can view it as property and exploit and destroy it almost at one\u2019s discretion\u2014not just in the United States but also in Europe, in fact everywhere throughout the world. There are environmental laws, but they only regulate the permitted level of destruction. However, in the first instance, rivers, forests, lakes and the atmosphere are fundamentally without rights. As unusual as the plan of giving nature rights may sound, there are precedents. The most well-known example is the Whanganui River in New Zealand. 140 years ago the Maoris and the whites signed a contract which recognized that the river was essential for the dignity and spirituality of the Maori. It was not until a few years ago that it was finally honored. Now two men, serving as guardians and sentinels, oversee the river and speak on its behalf should it prove necessary. In India the Yamuna and the Ganges have special rights. Both rivers are extremely polluted, and their status as legal subjects is designed to help improve their condition. In Ecuador mother earth, Pachamama, even appears in the constitution. And now the Mississippi too? In the headwater region the water is still crystal clear; a quiet river that leisurely meanders through the thick reeds. It is still unaware of the vast size to which it will swell before reaching the ocean. If Ol\u2019 Man River was to obtain the status of a legal person, like the rivers in New Zealand and India, this would be more than just another example. It would be a paradigm shift, the beginning of something big. Without rights of its own, it is hard to defend nature. When the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro came to power in 2019 he opened up the Amazon, the largest rainforest on earth, to destruction. A short while later the forest burned. The shocked world community threatened sanctions and donated money to nature conservationists. However, in principle, one was condemned to be a mere bystander while chain saws and fires consumed hectare upon hectare of irreplaceable forest. It was an ecological declaration of war, a crime against nature, under which the whole of humanity will suffer, in fact all living creatures on earth. Nevertheless, the UN Security Council was not convened, the arsonists were not stopped, Bolsonaro did not have to fear being called before a criminal court. Why not? Part of the answer: because there is no legal basis for this, because in the Western world there is no precedent for this, no example where the rights of nature have been formulated and their violation punished. Nevertheless, over recent years there has been an accumulation of scientific reports on the emotional depth of other living creatures and their ability to reason. Elephants can mourn, dolphins experience happiness, chimpanzees jealousy. The increasing evidence of the complexity and emotional sensitivity of animals also has legal consequences. Not for the whole of nature, but at least for the fauna. In Switzerland it is now illegal to cook lobsters live. Austria, Holland, and New Zealand have banned animal testing on apes. In Germany animals ceased to be mere objects in 2002. They are now fellow creatures and enjoy a legal status that limits the \u201cfreedoms\u201d of their owners. In particular, senseless cruelty is now prohibited and can be punished by up to three years in prison. According to animal welfare activists, such punishment shows that animals also possess the basic right to physical integrity. And consequently, according to the legal logic, they are also in possession of individual rights In short: They can file a lawsuit. Pigs against Germany This is precisely what German piglets are now doing. They are filing a lawsuit at the Federal Constitutional Court. The lawsuit was submitted by the animal protection organization PETA. The piglets, declared their lawyer, want a ban on the practice of ripping their testicles out without anesthetic. Millions of piglets every year are subjected to castration without anesthetic. In the words of the PETA lawyer, as the legal order protects animals in their own right, then they must also be recognized as \u201cnon-human legal persons.\u201d At the moment the majority of judges clearly see things differently: they are of the opinion that only people can possess rights. In 1988 a court in Hamburg refused to even accept a law suit from seals filed against the pollution of the North Sea. In 2010 the European Court of Justice refused to recognize an ape as a legal person. And it is still uncertain whether the pigs will have more luck in front of the Constitutional Court. However, ever since Christopher D. Stone caused a sensation in 1972 with his essay \u201cShould Trees Have Standing?\u201d, jurisprudence has been in a constant state of turmoil concerning rights for nature. Ultimately, the forest which formed its subject was not granted the right to go to court, but since then there has been the so-called class action. It enables nature conservation organizations to take court action in the name of nature. Rights for nature have developed. Maybe it will also work for the Mississippi. In order to understand the idea behind it one was to grasp the river as a whole: as a geological system composed of water and earth, as the lifeline of a hyper-productive agriculture, as a trade route of global importance, as a dynamic ecosystem with innumerable species, as the home of Native Americans. The Mississippi flows through the heartland of American extraction capitalism, which is based on the exploitation of resources. There are perhaps few places on earth where the destruction of nature and the massive predatory exploitation of her resources are so conspicuous and crass as here. Along her banks streets, oil pipelines, rail lines, and shipping routes cross like roots in a pot that has become too small for the plant. It constitutes one of the landscapes most radically altered by the human hand anywhere. 70 percent of the area of the state of Iowa is covered with corn monoculture. The Mississippi flows through the pulsating heart of American consumer society whose beat can be felt throughout the world. Ships, loaded with oil, raw plastic, deep frozen chicken parts, and neoprene suits disgorge their cargoes in the ports of Shanghai, Abidjan, Rotterdam, Itaqui, and Bremerhaven. In this respect, the Mississippi is a global river. If it had the right to protection this would set an example for the whole world. However, until now, anyone traveling down the river primarily sees two things: how ruthlessly it is exploited, and how much more a river is than just a highway for ships, an irrigation channel, a sewer and a rubbish dump, or a blue line on the map. A river and 4,000 dikes What is that, a river? First of all it is dynamic, movement, continual change. Over the course of time the Mississippi has repeatedly taken new paths. Abandoned channels were cut off, bends sanded up, natural dikes, created through deposited sediment, broke, opening up new paths for the water. Heraclitus called this continual change \u201cpanta rhei\u201d \u2013 everything flows, however one often forgets that in the case of a river such as the Mississippi everything really means everything: not just the water itself but the bank, the animals, humans and plants on its shores, even the river bed is in continual movement. For many people this dynamic is irritating, above all for those who see the river as a source of money. The Mississippi generates around 600 billion dollars annually through shipping, tourism, or water power. In order for the money to flow unobstructed, the Mississippi can only be where people want it to be. 29 dams and locks have been built along its course, plus 40,000 dikes and dozens of harbors. The Mississippi carries enormous quantities of sediment from its headwaters to the estuary where, over thousands of years, it has formed a branching delta, shaping the entire coastline of Louisiana. There is no more powerful engineer in the country than the Mississippi. However, it has a human competitor. The US Army Corps of Engineers is a sub-division of the military. The Corps operates the locks, builds and maintains the dams, it calculates the height of the dikes and dredges sediment. The Corps have been assigned the task of breaking the Mississippi\u2019s will.",

It has disappeared\u2014and along with it the original population. That is the first lesson on this journey: Violence against man and violence against nature are not the same, however, they often go hand in hand. And the closer one looks, the more blurred the distinction becomes. The second lesson: Natural systems are a finely balanced interplay of climatic, geological, biological, and human influences which have developed over millennia. Every change has consequences at another point, and the more radical the intervention then the more dramatic they are. \u201cNo effect without side effects,\u201d is a medical saying, and this also applies to ecosystems. Up until now, the side effects of industrialization and domestication have been viewed with indifference as the collateral damage of modernity. The people who now demand rights for nature want to change this, proposing a new contractual basis for our society. What is at stake is no less than a newly negotiated world contract between ourselves and all the other life who we share this planet with, and who we are dependent on. Saving the world in court In recent times judges have done more for environmental protection than governments. Courts ordered a stop to the clearance of the Hambach Forest in Germany, courts pronounced bans on motorized traffic in inner cities, courts ordered the Polish government to stop the deforestation of the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest. In the USA young people have taken their case to the courts as they see the climate crisis as robbing them of their right to life, freedom, and property. In Germany young people have submitted a constitutional complaint due to the government\u2019s climate policy. They are supported by a growing group of professional environmental lawyers, and the most successful of them can be found in the Hackney district of London. Located behind a caf\u00e9 are the offices of Client Earth. Seventy lawyers, many of them from elite universities, are giving Chinese judges lessons in environmental law, confronting the fishing lobby, and advising other environmental organizations. They are green alchemists who want to brew a magic potion. An elixir that could provide politicians and environmental activists with the power they have lacked until now in their struggle with financially well-endowed lobbyists and international concerns. The power of the law. Anyone who wants to force companies and governments to comply with laws, must wield the instrument that everyone fears: money. Money, as the lawyers from Client Earth continually emphasize, is the only language that their opponents understand. As soon as they have to pay for the environmental damage, everything will change. This is proven by the list of successes. The balance sheet of a single year, 2019, in Europe alone: The Polish government is forced to bury plans for the building of a 1.6 gigawatt coal-fired power plant. The European Union bans single-use plastic. The use of diesel vehicles is banned in many places in Germany. BP is impeached for greenwashing. The European Commission is forced to pass stricter regulations on the handling of hazardous chemicals. None of this is solely the result of classical environmental work, it required neither petitions nor protests. All this could be achieved on the basis of existing legislation, simply through the enforcement of applicable law by ecological law firms in the face of opposition from the well-resourced legal departments of associations, authorities, and businesses. By threatening them with action for damages, with fines and cuts in financing. A new front in battle for the protection of nature has opened up in the courts. An old fish and its problem A good example for studying the current relationship between man and nature is Acipenser fulvescens, the Lake Sturgeon that lives in the rivers and lakes of North America, including the Mississippi. The fish look like relics from a past geological era, and that\u2019s what they actually are. They swam in our planet\u2019s waters during the Triassic, more than 245 million years ago. They have been on earth over 800 times longer than we humans. However, we show no sign of respect for these elders. A sign at the side of the road reads \u201cGenoa National Fish Hatchery,&#8221; immediately beside it one can see a dozen geometrically arranged ponds. The hatchery is a breeding facility for engendered species of fish and mussels. There are seventy such facilities in the USA, and the star in Genoa is the Lake Sturgeon. In an oblong building there are a handful of water tanks the size of garden ponds. Bubbles ascend from the pipes, and between them hundreds of young sturgeon can be seen swimming, each the size of a child\u2019s hand. Bone plates protect the sturgeon from predators, their heads narrowing to a pointed mouth from which hang four little barbels. As the white settlers began to cast their nets here a few hundred years ago they repeatedly caught sturgeon. The fishermen killed the animals out of anger at the destruction they had caused to their nets, as sturgeon can grow old, and sturgeon can get big.",

                "text": "The settlers buried the bycatch fish in their fields as fertilizer, dried them to use as fuel for the boilers of the steam ships, or fed them to pigs. Then word got around how valuable their caviar is. The plague became a delicacy, and then really an endangered species. An employee of the American Fish and Wildlife Service, which operates the breeding facility, is standing next to one of the tanks and explains: \u201cThis was a pretty good year, we produced 180,000 sturgeon. We ship them everywhere, New Mexico, New York, Tennessee, Georgia, Maine. It\u2019s not that simple. First they are fed on brine shrimp, later bloodworms, then krill. Look,&#8221; he says, and lifts the lid of a polystyrene box. It contains blood worms, frozen into a block and blood red. \u201cWe get this stuff from China.\u201d The history of the breeding facility began in the 1930s, at the same time as the majority of the dams and locks were built along the river. Shipping on the Mississippi was booming, and like many other species, the river became an insurmountable barrier for the sturgeon. A brochure from the Fish and Wildlife Service tells the story so: \u201cFish populations in the lakes, streams, rivers, and coastal waters throughout the USA have shrunk or disappeared. The problems have increased with the growth of the human population, and it is down to all of us to solve them. With the aid of partners, the national breeding facilities are working towards ensuring a bright future for America\u2019s fish and other water creatures.\u201d It is an incredible quote, remarkable with respect to both its diagnosis as well as its refusal to draw the right conclusions. The brochure identifies population growth as the trigger (and not the even greater increase in the level of consumption, which is higher in the USA than almost anywhere), and it refuses to see that the breeding facility, as the supposed solution, is born from the same spirit as the problem: One cannot expect a revolution where nature is produced on an industrial scale. Whoever wants to protect people must protect nature A rigorous approach would involve seeing the river as something indivisible, as an organism which one can only preserve from destruction in its totality, not looking at species in isolation and breeding sturgeon in artificial ponds. The discussion is not about whether a river can be navigated or a tree felled. Such things are will still be permitted and no one wants to prohibit them. However there must be an awareness that the river has river rights, the sturgeon sturgeon rights, and the tree tree rights. The nature that surrounds us is not just a pile of inanimate matter, it also has an inner life. It is so radically different to our own that it is hard to find words for it. However, experiments have shown that honey bees can be pessimistic and crayfish can be frightened of the dark, that plants communicate with each other via networks of roots and fungi. We are slowly comprehending that increasing numbers of living creatures around us don\u2019t simply exist, they also feel. For many indigenous people such ideas are not revolutionary, but have been part of their culture for millennia. They also think about mountains, forests, and rivers in this manner. It is no coincidence that the decisive impulse in the movement for nature rights has come from indigenous communities, whose ideas have not been over-influenced by the Western value system. Within this system man defines his role\u2014as owner of the biosphere. He does not concede that nature itself can be the bearer of rights. \u201cThe idea that nature is merely a collection of things intended for human use is one of the most universal and unquestioned concepts in contemporary society,\u201d wrote the lawyer and environmental expert David Boyd in his book The Rights of Nature. Boyd is not just a law professor, he is also the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment. He is convinced that the protection of nature has also always been a question of the protection of people. That is why he fights for their preservation. Near Minneapolis the Minnesota River flows into the Mississippi, which at this point is reminiscent of black tea. In contrast the Minnesota is milky as it is full of nutrients and sediment. Much of it originates from the fields of the industrial agriculture in its drainage basin. Above all it is the phosphorus and nitrogen which are applied as artificial fertilizer and manure to the fields in the form of slurry. Where the two rivers meet a clearly visible dividing line proceeds in the water for some distance: It is as if they repelled one another. What happens here has consequences half a continent further southwards at the mouth of the river. The Gulf of Mexico does not just have the largest oil and gas reserves in the USA, it is also home to the country\u2019s largest fishing industry.",

                "text": "If one looks at a map of the Mississippi basin, the river resembles a gnarled tree which stretches its twisted branches in all directions. Its roots are formed by the bird foot-shaped delta which the river has created by depositing billions of tons of sediment over tens of thousands of years. Thus the river wrests land from the sea, and for a long time it was a conveyor belt for life in the Gulf, bringing the rare nutrients which everything in the area was hungry for. Today it is different. Every plant needs phosphorus and nitrogen, and in the soil both elements are only present in small quantities. However, the Mississippi now transports astronomical quantities of them into the Gulf. Above all they originate from the fields of the agro industry, which, almost exclusively, cultivates corn and soya on an enormous scale in the Midwest. This is then processed to make animal feed. Downstream are the buyers: CAFO \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operations\u201d, huge feedlots for pigs, cattle, and chickens, some with tens of thousands of animals. In the United States almost thirteen times more animal feces than human feces are produced, and the excrement has to land somewhere. The disposal methods are adventurous: Part of the pig muck, which is relatively runny, is projected into the air and dispersed by the wind, landing somewhere. However, the majority of the slurry ends up on the fields as fertilizer. There are no restrictions on the quantity. The plants can absorb some of it, but not all. The large rest is washed into the Mississippi by the rain and carried into the Gulf of Mexico. Here algae delight in the abundance of nutrients. Similar to the diatoms in the Antarctic, the algae grow and grow and grow to form huge carpets which after dying and sinking to the sea floor produce low-oxygen dead zones in which hardly any living\u00a0 creature can exist. The ocean suffocates. A desert on the seafloor, created by the industrial agriculture 1,500 kilometers away. In some years the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico extends across an area of more than 2,000,000 hectares. Ultimately, humans also suffer, as the fishermen increasingly pull empty nets from the depths. One calls such regions \u201csacrifice zones.\u201d The prosperity of the rich farmers in the north is paid for by the fishermen in the south. The third lesson that the Mississippi teaches us: If no one is called to account for their actions, then nothing changes. If the Mississippi was a person then one could sue the people responsible on its behalf. Not because they violate environmental regulations, but because too much fertilizer is poisonous, and that contravenes the river\u2019s right to physical integrity. Farmers would then have to pay fines, along with the operators of feedlots or oil refineries, because they violate the river\u2019s health and dignity. The trick in the activists\u2019 demands: As a legal person the Mississippi itself would be the recipient of the fines and penalty fees. The money would no longer simply flow into the coffers of the State of Louisiana, instead it could be used for rewilding measures such as dike relocation or the dismantling of dams. It would make the river healthier. Crime: ecocide To state things clearly: Environmental crimes are crimes against humans. Always. Whoever feeds wastewater into a river or pollutes the air, poisons plants, animals, and ultimately people too. Whoever knowingly accepts the release of large quantities of climate-damaging gases into the atmosphere, negligently accepts the suffering of people. Ecocide, the large-scale destruction of biodiversity, is a crime against humanity, and it should be treated as such. However, this is not the case. An attempt to include the destruction of nature in the International Criminal Court\u2019s Rome Statute in 1996 proved unsuccessful. However, thanks to the organization Ecological Defence Integrity, the idea is being discussed again. \u201cWe need an extension of our collective responsibility, we need to take care of the whole living world,\u201d said the now deceased founder, Polly Higgins, \u201cThe earth needs a good lawyer.\u201d In actual fact, personal liability could shift power structures. If managers or heads of government could actually be held accountable for the natural destruction caused by their companies or administrations, if they faced fines or even imprisonment, this would be a game changer. Up until now no one needs to fear being called to responsibility for the forest fires in Australia or the destruction of fishing grounds in the Atlantic. The destruction of the foundations of human life is not a crime and therefore cannot be punished. Tragedy of the Commons Farmers are not evil people. Many of them are under enormous economic pressure. In order to survive they have to squeeze as much profit from their fields and animals as possible. If slurry ends up in the Mississippi and is washed into the Gulf, then that is aggravating\u2014however, the farmers are neither legally responsible, nor liable to pay damages for the environmental destruction. The same applies to the huge, publicly listed meat and animal feed concerns. They rake in the profits and pass on the consequential costs to the general public, future generations, and nature. It is the \u201cTragedy of the Commons,&#8221; of communal property, as described by Garrett Hardin in the magazine Science in 1968. Put briefly, the tragedy proceeds as follows: A couple of farmers share a communal pasture, the common. Each of them herds the same number of cattle onto it, however the total number remains below the threshold that would lead to overgrazing. Then a framer doubles the number of his cattle. Now the grass on the pasture doesn\u2019t grow quite as well. But now one of the farmers is twice as rich as the others. They all know that a meadow can die if too many animals trample over it. However, they are also egotistical, and so each one of them asks why they in particular should stick to the rules when the meadow is already overused. So all the famers herd more cattle onto the common. The green meadow is quickly transformed into a muddy field on which no cattle can graze anymore. Everyone saw it coming. However, everyone knew that it is no use being the only one who is modest, as the meadow would be destroyed by the others anyway. And on top of that he would have earned even less than all the others. At the end everyone lost everything. A tragedy. Does the story sound familiar? The \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d is now a global story which repeats itself a thousand fold. In the overfished seas, in the atmosphere enriched with greenhouse gases, in the Mississippi contaminated with slurry. Every person uses the common property of nature\u2014until it is lost to all. However, the tragedy need not have a sad ending, as proven by the research of the Nobel Prize winner for economics, Elinor Ostrom. She has shown that self-managed communal property can even produce the highest yields on a sustained basis. The precondition: There are rules, prohibitions, laws. As in the past. As the Italian law professor Ugo Mattei argues, one can read economic history since the Middle Ages as capital\u2019s assault on the established commons structures. Step for step ever more land and water, one lake and one forest after the other, has been privatized. What used to belong to everyone is now a business for the few. It is here, at the latest, that we arrive at the Mississippi again. As a few people profit considerably from its exploitation, it is treated ruthlessly. The general public are left to pay the ecological and social costs. If there were strong rights for nature, it would be different. The philosopher Daniele Dell\u2019Agli even fundamentally questions our right of ownership: \u201cYes, lease, cultivate, and use according to strict rules oriented towards the common welfare\u2014but without a property title, without the right and the power to sell humanity\u2019s property, raise interest on it, utilize it, or employ it as an extortionary deposit.\u201d Capitalism was first able to develop its destructive power over nature and humans with the backing of a liberalized property law.\u00a0 As in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, 173.6 miles upriver, where a factory is located and a pipeline ends. Donaldsonville is situated between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. There is hardly anywhere else in the USA with a higher concentration of petrochemical industry plants. The residents have a nickname for their region, they call it \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d In some municipalities the probability of contracting cancer is 700 times higher than the national average. More than seventy oil refineries, fertilizer, plastic, and neoprene factories, steel and aluminum works are closely congregated along this stretch of the Mississippi. What is manufactured here is distributed throughout the world. However, the buyers in Hamburg, Hanoi, or Hurghada have no idea of the toxic waste that is generated during their production. In Donaldsonville, every man, woman, and child breathes in the poison. The region in which 75 percent of the population is Afro-American, and whose income is significantly below the national average, is a \u201csacrifice zone.\u201d One could describe the whole of Cancer Alley as such. Human and ecological collateral damage, which unfortunately cannot be avoided if one wants to do business.",

                "text": "A drop of water in the Mississippi takes ninety day to flow from the source to the river mouth. Here the many drops combined are unbelievably powerful\u2014and the hubris of those who believe they have tamed the great old river becomes visible. For with every centimeter deeper the river bed is dredged, with every meter that the dikes are raised, the energy of the water mass increases. More water in less space means more violence. One of its victims: New Orleans. From here it is not far to the mouth of the river. And in order to shorten the distance for the large freighters, tankers, and container ships , the Army Corps of Engineers built a canal in the 1960s. The Mississippi River Grand Outlet, for short Mr. Go, devoured billions. It was advertised with the slogan: \u201cThe Mississippi built a good connection to the sea. We are building a better one.\u201d It was a megalomaniacal statement, and one with a bitter punchline. Far fewer ships than expected used Mr. Go. Instead, hurricanes could took the shortcut to New Orleans. On two occasions destructive storms have carried flood waves into the city via Mr. Go, tearing down houses and killing people. The last one to reap destruction was Katrina in 2005. Today 250,000 less people live in New Orleans than before the storm as so many lost their houses. Above all it was the poor, without insurance, savings account, or share portfolio, who had to pay for this megalomania. At some point a lake disappears, dries out, becomes overgrown. In contrast a river doesn\u2019t die so easily, the Mississippi has a long life. It is stronger than the human art of engineering, stronger than the dams and dikes. It is more patient than concrete, it thinks in millennia. Mark Twain wrote of the Mississippi that one: \u201ccannot tame that lawless stream, cannot curb it or confine it, cannot say to it, go here, or go there, and make it obey; cannot save a shore that it has sentenced; cannot bar its path with an obstruction which it cannot tear down, dance over and laugh at.\u201d What is a river then: a highway? A blue line on the map? A spiritual source? A habitat and a pantry? A place of hubris? A technical challenge? All that and more. However, the Mississippi is mute, it cannot speak for itself. But that is true for companies, foundations, people suffering from dementia, cities, states, and children too. And they have rights despite this. For very good reasons. This protects them from exploitation and destruction. This was not always the case. In The Descent of Man, Charles Darwin describes how our morality has expanded its scope throughout the history of our species. At the beginning it just encompassed ourselves and our close family members. Step by step, Homo sapiens began to take an interest in the \u201chappiness of all his fellow men,\u201d later \u201chis sympathies became more tender\u201d and also included people with disabilities, the injured, and finally animals. It is time for even more tender sympathy. When we realized that the sun did not revolve around us, the Middle Ages came to an end. Today we are learning that we are not the only creatures with feelings, thoughts, and an inner life. Our legal understanding still rigorously suppresses this insight. In order to do it justice we must extend our morality. And if stock corporations can have rights, then there is no reason to deny them to the Mississippi.

We found a host of connections and associations by comparing two of the objects we produced: an oak gall and a square of silk. While writing about, drawing, and diagramming those relationships over the course of the workshop, we had a rich conversation around the entanglement of humans, history, ecology, and technology. Our conversation led us to draw out the following unifying concepts: Unity and diversity of codes: ink to write, holes in Jacquard looms, punch cards and oak galls, algorithms and computers, text as stories and binary codes Multiscale weaving: from cellulose \ufb01ber synthesis in leaves (nanometric scale) to textile weaving (metric scale) The question of domestication\u2014from the domesticated silkworm to the domestication of humans via textiles and computers Nonhuman intelligence: plants as solar energy converters, insects as transformers and converters of plant material Resource use: human dependency on plants as a resource base, the cyclical tendencies of the biosphere versus the noncyclical tendencies of the technosphere How to approach this exercise Facilitator directs the group to sit in a circle around several large sheets of paper. Each group member empties their pockets/purse/backpack and selects several objects to present to the group. Participants introduce themselves and the objects they have selected. The facilitator leads the group in asking a series of questions about each of the objects. The facilitator takes notes on one of the pieces of paper in the center of the group (or on a whiteboard). Working with each other and with the facilitator, the group selects two objects to contrast and compare as a group. The facilitator guides the process of creating a drawing (on a fresh piece of paper, referring to the notes from step 3), combining text, objects, and lines to create a mind-map showing how the objects relate to each other, to humans, and to other lifeforms. The facilitator may choose to ask for or assign a scribe(s), or do the writing or drawing her- or himself. Questions around the objects Who made this object? When was this object made? What is the object made of? Where did the materials to make this object come from? How long will this object last? Will it turn into something else once it is no longer in its current form? Who uses this object? Does it have more than one use? What speed does this object have? Is this object domesticated, wild, or domesticating? Any other questions you like\u2026 Making sense of the conversation and the connections The group analyzes their collective drawings. The analysis considers how the pair of objects are connected (in many ways). What stories can these connected objects tell about the Anthropocene? The group \ufb01nishes the process by adding a title to their drawing relating to the themes or ideas they explored.",

                "text": "The Mississippi River has long invited human tinkering to improve the productivity that humans can derive from its inherent powers. Compared to a car\u2019s engine however, a river is shockingly inefficient. It is estimated that as much as 98 percent of a river&#8217;s potential energy is lost to friction and dissipated as heat.Richard White, The Organic Machine: The Remaking of The Columbia River. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996, p. 6. For good or ill, along the Mississippi, attempts have been made to improve this ratio and other forms of riverine productivity through both small- and large-scale engineering projects. Today, it is increasingly recognized that the effects of these attempts at hydrological control have proven of both local and planetary consequence. This short essay is part of a longer work which sets out the long history of attempts to put not just the river but the entire Mississippi watershed to work. These visions of a productive basin, realized or not, demonstrate the limits of human intentionality when faced with the complex cascades of relations set into motion by flowing water. Here the idea of a working watershed is explored via observations made in October 2019 during the fourth leg of the Anthropocene River Journey, and the consultation of both paper and sedimentary archives. Foremost a basin Bisecting the continent, the distinct energy geography of the Mississippi River has long influenced patterns of settlement, trade, and industry in North America and beyond. The various names it has been known by, from the \u201cMisi-ziibi,\u201d to \u201cMother of Rivers\u201d or \u201cFather of the Waters,\u201d \u201cBig Muddy,\u201d to the \u201cstrong brown god,\u201d also demonstrate its deep cultural resonances. Moreover, its unstoppable flow has inspired myriad plans for a more productive watershed. But before getting to this point, one might ask, why think in terms of basins at all? The Anthropocene denotes a new earth historical era, in which the planetary appears to be the scale at which human actions reach their most urgent conclusion. In response, this essay suggests that rather than immediately scaling up our thinking to such an all-encompassing perspective, we should consider the transformative capacities of the Earth system\u2019s component regions. Less-easily defined, these planetary provinces are distinguished by shared dynamic properties.According to this definition, the planet is of course also region. The archetypal region is the river basin, a site in which the hydrological cycle offers an observable degree of holism. But regions defy abstraction and can only be discussed in specific terms. A belief in regionalism testifies to the belief that true descriptions of earthly processes can be understood only as an outcome of the interaction between physical laws, ecology, and human interventions manifest in specific places, a structure of relations from which myriad possibilities emerge.For a clear articulation of regionalism, see Richard Hartshorne, The Nature of Geography: a critical survey of current thought in the light of the past, Lancaster, PA: Association of American Geographers, 1935, p. 289. Regions might be thought of as meaningful components of a prohibitively complex Earth system which can only be understood via abstraction. Regionalism heads in the other direction, toward the specific and the local. Moreover, rather than working with computational abstractions, geographers have long argued that regions can only truly be understood via fieldwork: by direct engagement with place. So it was that in October 2019 I joined a venerable group of paddlers who have sought to understand the Mississippi by entering its flow. In travelling by canoe, environmental historian Richard White has written, you get to know nature through labor. You become intimately acquainted with a river\u2019s unique energy geography, be it through paddling, or negotiating its currents, eddies, whorls, and boils. You can also become aware of the labor-saving potentialities of its flow, the shifting velocities of its meanders, and the smoothing or roughening effects of riverbed topography; a variety of propulsive means that require more experience than brawn.",

Less than half the length of the Mississippi, and with a greater elevation, at 820 meters versus the Mississippi at 450, the Columbia is a far more obviously turbulent river.Richard White, The Organic Machine: The Remaking of the Columbia River. New York, NY: Hill and Wang, 1995, p. 10. But though seemingly more languid, the Mississippi is in fact far more powerful. The Columbia expels just 7,500 cubic meters of water per second, while the Mississippi releases 16,790 cubic meters per second into Gulf of Mexico. Vast quantities of water are amassed as it passes through a landmass of 3.2-million-kilometres, a gently banked watershed more than five times larger than that of the Columbia. Given this distinctive profile, what if White\u2019s immersive approach to understanding a river\u2019s energy is applied to the Mississippi?",

Considered in this way, it was clear that our line of travel had been predetermined by energy; specifically the law of energy conservation, which over millennia has caused the river and its sediment to carve a path of least resistance through a landscape, minimizing its expenditure of energy in accordance with this inescapable principle.White, p. 12.  Moreover, like the tangles of a trees\u2019 roots and leaves, the very landscapes through which we would travel, from the dendritic fractals of the river\u2019s many tributaries to the spidery deltaic outlets at its mouth, can be explained as an outcome of the structuring effects of the second law of thermodynamics, that of energy dissipation.Axel Kleidon, Thermodynamic Foundations of the Earth System. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2016, p. 118. Riding an archive On a balmy October day, the fourth leg of the canoe journey began in the small town of Cairo (pronounced Kay-ro) at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi. Nervously loading the boats, it was easy to forget that 337 years earlier Frenchman Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier Sieur de La Salle and his crew had made a similar journey. Their route had also ended at the Gulf of Mexico, where, amid alluvial mud, La Salle had declared all upriver land, water, people, and resources the possession of his King Louis XIV. Returning to Paris from the newly named \u201cLouisiane,\u201d La Salle had been appointed Viceroy of this new territory. Two years later, looking to consolidate his rule, he set sail from La Rochelle with four ships loaded with enough priests, guns, soldiers, and women to establish a colony. However, his fleet mistakenly landed in Texas. Forced to continue overland, they dragged their canons and supplies, and subsisted on alligator flesh. Perhaps unsurprisingly, La Salle was eventually murdered by his mutinous crew.Isaac Joslin Cox, The Journeys of R\u00e9n\u00e9 Robert Cavelier Sieur de la Salle as Related by His Faithful lieutenant, Henri De Tonnt. New Haven, CT: A.S. Barnes &amp; Company, 1905. Though ending in failure, the notion that this new world should be governed as a watershed would assume and retain a hold over the imagination of Francophone colonialists, not least diplomat-historian Alexander de Tocqueville, who saw the Mississippi Valley, with its surface area six times greater than that of the Kingdom of France, as potentially the \u201cmost magnificent dwelling-place prepared by God for man\u2019s abode.\u201dAlexis de Tocqueville, \u201cExterior Form of North America\u201d, Democracy in America, Trans. 1841. Vol. 1, New York, NY: J. and H.G. Langley, p. 20. Even a century later, the memory of La Salle\u2019s declaration would help support a belief that it was the demarcations of its river basins which offered an appropriate unit over which North American sovereignty should be administered.Benton Mackaye, From Geography to Geotechnics. Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1968, p. 60. Of course, the region\u2019s history did not begin with this colonial expropriation. Nor were colonialists distinguished by their reverence for watersheds. Water held, and continues to hold a sacred role for Indigenous Americans. Its availability and wise-use were, and are still, worshipped as a precondition of continued human existence and means of cosmological distinction between the secular and spiritual realms. Craig Colten, \u201cMeaning of water in the American South: Transatlantic Encounters\u201d, Atlantic Studies, Vol. 5, No. 2 (2008): pp. 203-222. 207. Moreover, a veneration for the spatial cohesion of river valleys was far from just a European idea. Remaining place names in and around New Orleans suggest that, if not strictly demarcated by watersheds, indigenous political geography was also strongly associated with these obvious markers of spatial coherence.Ibid. In the 1680s, La Salle\u2019s crew had come into contact with Indigenous peoples from the Natchez, Koroa, Taensa, Chickasaw, and Choctaw tribes. These peoples had long recognized the productive capacities of the watershed. Settled on or near bluffs, the river provided fresh water, clay, and fish, as well as acting as a lure for bison and a conduit for transport, trade, raids, and inter-tribal enslavement.Patricia Galloway, LaSalle and His Legacy: Frenchmen and Indians in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 1982. These were the survivors of a more centralized society that had developed for at least one thousand years across the lower-section of the river, united by a shared religion and a tendency to build monumental mounds, of the kind found at Cahokia, just outside of St. Louis.Jennifer Colten and Jesse Vogler, \u201cSignificant and Insignificant Mounds: An Essay,\u201d\u00a0Anthropocene Curriculum\u00a0(blog), Aug 28, 2019: https://www.anthropocene-curriculum.org/contribution/significant-and-insignificant-moundsHere, the ability to intensively cultivate maize, nourished by the river\u2019s gift of rich alluvial soil, allowed society to grow in size and organizational complexity. In recognition of the centrality of the river to this civilization, archaeologists termed this age and its people the \u201cMississippian.\u201dJennifer Ross, Sharon Steadman., eds.

An array of fine matter, minerals, particles, clays, microbiota, and more novel sediments such as plastic were suspended within its flow. Marine biologist Rachel Carson poetically described the deposition of this cavalcade of material as the \u201cthe most stupendous \u2018snowfall\u2019 the earth has ever seen.\u201dRachel Carson, The Sea Around Us, New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1951. Ground down by heat, cold, wind, rain, and motion, these minute entities incessantly enter into planetary circulation.Peter Haff, \u201cTechnology and Human Purpose: The Problem of Solids Transport on the Earth\u2019s Surface,\u201d Earth Systems Dynamics, 3 (2012): pp. 149-156. Though initially buoyed by the hydrological cycle, each particle gradually loses its fight against gravity and settles somewhere on Earth\u2019s surface. The resulting layers, or laminations, Carson suggested, offer a \u201csort of epic poem of the earth\u201d for those able to decipher their meaning.Op. Cit., note 18. Today, advances in radiocarbon dating mean cores of sediment drilled from riverbeds can tell rich sagas. The nature inhabited by Indigenous Americans was far from untouched. They harvested timber, farmed maize, drained swamps, maintained flood plains, and built dams to redirect flows and trap fish. Though small scale, these Earthly recalibrations resulted in subtle but distinguishable changes in a river\u2019s sedimentation processes, reflected in the shifting composition of laminations.E. Stinchcomb, T. C. Messner, S. G Driese., L. C. Nordt, and R. M. Stewart, \u201cPre-colonial (A.D. 1,100\u20131,600) sedimentation related to prehistoric maize agriculture and climate change in eastern North America\u201d, Geology 39 (2011): pp. 363-366. Assuming such practices were widespread, a belief in the Mississippi basin as a pre-colonial \u201cnatural\u201d flood plain would be as mistaken as a belief in \u201cprehistory.\u201d These granular witnesses also tell of a dramatic shift in North American history. The arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century and the intensified agriculture and deforestation which followed, caused a marked increase in erosion, leaving a thicker legacy of sedimentary layers an order of magnitude higher than those formed by Indigenous Americans.James Knox. \u201cPlain Sedimentation in the Upper Mississippi Valley: Natural Versus Human Accelerated\u201d, Geomorphology, 79 (2006): pp. 286-310. It was clear that as sedimentologists have become more attuned to reading earth\u2019s signals, the distinction between field and archive dissolves. Our canoe rode atop of not just layers of water travelling at different velocities but also a thick repository of interactions between Earth and human history which all-the-while the river was busily archiving.",

                "text": "Working water The greatest shift to the river\u2019s sediment load has come from a sequence of efforts to put its flow to work. Damming, levees, and dredging have created a sediment starved river, a lightened load which denies the Louisiana coast sufficient means of regeneration.Tyler Priest, Jason Theriot. \u201cWho Destroyed the Marsh? Oil field Canals, Coastal Ecology, and the Debate over Louisiana\u2019s Shrinking Wetlands\u201d, Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Wirtschaftsgeschichte/Economic History Yearbook, 2. (2009): pp. 69-80. Despite this ambitious re-engineering, the Mississippi remains a river largely unsuited to the derivation of hydrological power. Sitting in a canoe demonstrates why. The river\u2019s flow does a large part of the work of transporting you downstream, particularly where it narrows, but even so, you won\u2019t travel faster than about five miles an hour.Thanks to John Kim, our canoes carried sensors to record various parameters, from geolocation to acceleration. Over the five legs of the journey, the canoes averaged 4.5 miles per hour. https://github.com/grahamammal/miss_river_data The interaction between topography and gravity has imparted a subtle power upon the river\u2019s main branch which is not easily harnessed. From source to sink the river descends just 450 meters over its 2,350-mile length, averaging a mere 20 centimeters per mile. In the words of water-power historian of technology Louis Hunter, the river\u2019s its main trunk was \u201cunable to power much more than a country mill.\u201dLouis Hunter, A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1780-1939. Vol. 1., Waterpower in the Century of the Steam Engine. Charlottesville, VA: University of Virginia Press, 1979, p. 133. Despite this lack of tractable vitality, upstream lakes and reservoirs have been used as means of accumulating water power, providing an enviable form of energy storage exploited by dams such as that developed at Keokuk, Iowa (otherwise known as Lock and Dam No. 19).Hunter, 1979, p. 509. In fact, the main trunk of the lower river better serves as a moving reservoir, a body of water able to diffuse the power of more dynamic tributaries such as the Missouri, Arkansas, Red, Ohio, Minnesota, Saint Croix, Chippewa, and Wisconsin rivers, as well as the powerful upper river.Hunter, 1979, p. 134. Like a power plant\u2019s coolant pond, in normal conditions, the lower river redistributes the energy of these dynamic inputs, safely conveying their power out to sea.Of course, when rainfall overloads the system, devastating flooding occurs, as was the case in 1927. See John Barry, Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America. Riverside, NJ: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2007. From the 1880s onward, entrepreneurial Europeans began to generate electricity by using water to rotate vast coils of wire within a magnetic field. The problem was that the resulting electricity could only be conveyed short distances. It took a decade, and the invention of alternating current\u2014the intermittent reversal in current\u2019s direction of travel\u2014to allow electricity be transmitted over far longer distances without prohibitive losses in voltage.Thomas Hughes, Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins, 1983, pp. 93-94, and White, p. 49.Suspended with sufficient tension, transmission lines could now carry water-derived energy over vast distances, allowing flows of electrons to bypass the constraints of a river\u2019s geography. However, due to its shallow descent, the main-branch Mississippi remained as unsuited to the derivation of hydro-electricity as hydropower. Besides the Keokuk dam, St. Anthony Falls provides another site of energy derivation. There in 1882, the Minnesota Brush Electric Company built the first central hydroelectrical station in the U.S. To demonstrate the wonders of electrification to a skeptical public, eight arc-lights were hung from a 257-meter tower in the center of Minneapolis. The result was a Mississippi-powered \u201cman-made moon\u201d intended to cast a shadow over a mile away: the river seemingly disagreed with such exhibitionism, and the underwhelming result cast its light in a radius of just one-hundred feet.Larry Millet, Lost Twin Cities. St Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society, 1992, p. 109. Thanks to Joe Underhill and Jacqui DeVries from Augsburg University for hunting down the following reference. Joseph Zalusky, \u201cBridge Square: Going, Going, Gone,\u201d Hennepin County History, 21 1 (1961): p. 5-7. The watershed also does plenty of logistical work. Its main branch provides a means of low-friction transport for vast quantities of goods. The regularized channel we all smoothly traversed was the result of a series of initiatives that had begun after the Civil War. With Congressional support, the US Army Corps of Engineers had begun, in the words of historian of the Mississippi John Anfinson a \u201cmassive if disjointed Earth engineering project\u201d aimed at turning the river basin from a diffuse wetland into an concentrated channel of a uniform 4\u00bd foot depth at low-tide.John Anfinson, \u201cPerfecting and Recreating Nature on the Upper Mississippi River\u201d, in Brunn Stanley ed. Engineering Earth: The Impacts of Megaengineering Projects. Springer, 2011. The Corps other major intervention, the levee system, built to constrain the river\u2019s propensity to flood, and which limits its depositional propensities, generally lay out of sight beyond the treeline.Martin Reuss, \u201cAndrew A. Humphreys and the Development of Hydraulic Engineering: Politics and Technology in the Army Corps of Engineers, 1850-1950\u201d, Technology and Culture, 26 1 (1985) pp. 1-33. Around 1905, the Inland Waterways Commission, a group of entrepreneurs and idealists, had hoped to continue this process of enhancement by persuading President Theodore Roosevelt of the need to widen and deepen the river\u2019s channel further to allow for the passage of larger and heavier towboats. Their spokesperson, geologist-ethnologist William McGee environed a fourteen-foot wide channel stretching from Chicago to New Orleans, which he hoped would act as a vast conduit for steel ships packed with coal, wheat, timber and iron. Costs, he argued, could be recouped by developing a large hydro-electrical plant, possibly in St. Louis.Ian Tyrell, Crisis of the Wasteful Nation: Empire and Conservation in Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s America, Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2015, p. 120. It was the partial achievement of this vision through which we travelled. The submerged wing dams we dodged as we canoed the outer edges of the river acted as sentinels to the past\u2019s logistical ambitions, their chicane-like structure maintaining a concentrated flow and ensuring sediment incessantly scours the riverbed. Deepened by the river\u2019s work, the passage of towboats and their improbably large retinues of barges is assured. On our stretch, we saw wind turbine blades heading to the Midwest and refinery components, like a floating chemistry set, headed to Texas via the Gulf Intracoastal waterway. Though deceptively wild at points, the intermittent traffic reminded us that this was less a river than an industrial archaeology.",

Our collective will to consume, move, and grow\u2014and the fossilized carbon we enrolled to do so\u2014have seemingly altered the dynamics of an oceanic river whose volumetric flow is three-thousand times greater than that which we had just travelled.Damien Carrington, \u201cGulf Stream current at its weakest in 1,600 years, studies show,\u201d The Guardian, April 11, 2018: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/11/critical-gulf-stream-current-weakest-for-1600-years-research-finds; Voituriez, Bruno. The Gulf Stream. Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. 2006. In this all enveloping context, it was impossible to ignore that attempts to tame the river, to transform the watershed into a tractable and productive \u201corganic machine,\u201d to use White\u2019s term, had in fact played a contributing role in unleashing a far wider set of relations whose outcomes exceeded human intentionality. We had learnt first-hand, as White had known, that rivers are \u201ctied to larger organic cycles beyond our control.\u201dRichard White, The Organic Machine: The Remaking of The Columbia River.

It gathered seventy students from fourteen disciplines (from philosophy, art, history, geography to geology, biology, physics, and mathematics).

                "text": "After an inaugural introduction by ENS president Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pinton, Confluence Museum director H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lafont-Couturier, and Lyon\u2019s deputy mayor Georges K\u00e9p\u00e9n\u00e9kian, four keynote panels explored four key themes: The question of agriculture and food in the Anthropocene with a deep historical and prospective view (Matthieu Calame, fondation pour le progr\u00e8s de l\u2019Homme, Paris) Aesthetics in the Anthropocene with a survey of the practices and psychological implications of our perception of the environment and its degradation (Nathalie Blanc, CNRS Paris) War and strategy in the Anthropocene, building on key examples from contemporary conflicts as well as the very root of the Great Acceleration in the two world wars (Jean-Michel Valantin, the (red) team analysis, Paris) How algorithms and platforms reshape not only the economy, but also our relation to territories and governance (St\u00e9phane Grumbach, INRIA Lyon). All four panels were followed by lively debate with participants, fueled by a number of provocative statements such as \u201cthe Sahara may be a product of humanity and agricultural practices\u201d; \u201cSomali fishermen became pirates and then competent hackers in a few years as a consequence of a failed state and exploitation of sea resources by opportunistic countries\u201d; \u201cNegative pleasure is a subliminal overarching theme in Anthropocene aesthetics\u201d; and \u201cHorizontalization through algorithmic intermediation is a way of replacing legality by legitimacy, and thus a way of reframing democracy.\u201d The afternoons centered around group work, with a strong creative twist. On day one, participants proposed their representations of the Anthropocene in a variety of media, including paint, drawing, and video, allowing them to confront their ideas and express themselves across disciplines. On day two, participants interacted with project leaders from civil society (didactics of global warming, urban gardens, landscape archeology, documentary realization, social and sustainable accommodation, artistic practice) and learnt how to shape a project as well as how to develop their own views on the Anthropocene from a more concrete perspective. On day three, they reflected on their recent experience in the Curriculum to identify key themes and questions to put forward in their own projects (see below). Students prepared two cultural evenings: biologists and geologists organized an anthropocenic tour of the Confluence Museum, which holds an impressive natural sciences and ethnographic collection. Each Student presented an object from the Museum and an associated keyword (e.g. an aboriginal painting and the word \u201cpigment\u201d or \u201cselfish\u201d) to fuel group debate. The following night, Paul-Etienne Pini, a geography student, presented the question of nuclear waste and introduced Michael Madsen\u2019s 2010 documentary Into Eternity with a critical view on its form. A debate followed, with all participants contributing their point of view, in a true interdisciplinary synthesis. The last afternoon was dedicated to the design of students\u2019 projects (to achieve within the academic year, 2016\u201217). Ten projects emerged, among them: educational tools (video games on strategy including the randomness of nature and human decisions; events in schools to generate awareness of our epoch and the origins of our everyday products); artistic performances (\u201ctechnofossils\u201d to disperse in the city of Lyon, juggling as a metaphoric way to represent the Anthropocene, theatrical conferences); textual/sociological analysis of the current generation of students facing the challenges of the Anthropocene, practical tools (digital platform to improve access to sustainable practices, urban agriculture, renewable energy prototypes at ENS); prospective essays (ideal cities from the Renaissance to the near future with focus on Lyon, building on history and philosophy but also comic books and mathematics). The Curriculum ended with a seminal talk by Ioan Negrutiu (director of the Michel Serres Institute) on how to shape a \u201cslow Anthropocene.\u201d Overall, the feedback from students and conveners has been very positive, and a follow-up edition is already envisioned from 2017 onwards, with additional academics partners (i.e. the National conservatory of music in Lyon, the political science school) and cultural institutions (i.e. Contemporary Art Institute, other museums), as well as contributions from participants of the 2016 Curriculum.",

                "text": "The first stirring indicates life. The first gesture indicates meaning. The first word indicates intention. Language is a point of departure for the values we hold. Does a language have a beginning and end, like those we assign to a river? The mouth of this \u201criver\u201d is where we approach language, but, like the unclear headwaters, the story begins much earlier. A river begins inside of the heart of a mountain\u2014inside the moan of thunder\u2014spun from headwaters, an almost-silent pond spiraling with a whispering thread of water disappearing into the forest to flow and flow and flow. The song of a whale echoes through ocean waters\u2014that were indeed once the beginning of rivers\u2014anthems of aliveness and companions to those like the salmon who return to their natal waters, traveling upstream, their memory feasts digested inside the bellies of some of the ancient swimming makers of milk. A river begins on the edges of stories. We travel to the depths of the beginnings of the river when we ask our grandmothers to share something from their childhood. A river begins inside the grief of forgetting. A river begins in the fingertips of a weaver. Maureen Walrath The Language of Responsible Care\u2122 It is through the remoteness of words that so many of us manifest our relationships to place\u2014conjuring the significance of an environment through borrowed assumptions, locating ourselves within some predetermined coordinates, inhabiting a place only after we have already decided on its limits. We are obedient to politicized terminologies, vocabularies shaped by curricula that are afforded to the few, ephemeral hashtags that accumulate social capital. If so much of our experience and sense of responsibility toward land is shaped by the most profitable of words, what do we find behind these terms? Landscapes are deeply personal. I find that there is great incongruence between how fast technologies change landscapes and how slow we are to culturally absorb or adopt to those changes. Our identities are often connected to a very static rendering of a place\u2014we often haven\u2019t seen what it was before \u201cus,\u201d or what it might be. That limited vision often means we fear landscape change because we fear losing that which defines us. Roopali Phadke Line 3 Debate and the Anthropocene\u00a0is an essay by Bianca Acevedo Gonzalez, shared in John Kim\u2019s\u00a0Anthropocene and the Media\u00a0seminar. Gonzalez explores the contrasting discourse around Canadian energy multinational Enbridge\u2019s Line 3 pipeline replacement project\u2014between the ways in which Dakota and Lakota peoples, and extractive companies, each relate to the land. \u201cThrough my analysis of the videos,\u201d\u00a0Gonzalez writes, referring to a collection of videos that encompasses work produced by the non-profit organization Honor the Earth, by Native activists, and in turn by Enbridge, \u201cI found that Enbridge focused on the economic benefits of the construction of the new Line 3 while activists focused on the environmental, cultural and spiritual impacts of the pipeline project.\u201d On one hand, there is what the land can provide for us. The agency we have to take what we need from it for monetary profit\u2014where development is permitted because it promises capital gains, and value is immediate. In this imagining, there is no such thing as\u00a0free\u00a0space\u2014you might even say there are no more landscapes. Every place is limited by borders and a specific use; privatized, exploited for its potential value, and in this way imprisoned within itself. On the other hand, there are the teachings of elders. The requirements of wild rice. The beauty of places associated with human spirituality and ritual, or tended to by non-human beings. The imagining of a time far beyond the present moment. The respect given to a place that can exist only for itself. The justification of these qualities is challenging for legal systems that demand a linear message of growth, development, capital. The seductive term of progress is defined by return-on-investment, by the ability of companies to perpetuate their own businesses. What other effects does this numbing have on us? The best developments are community driven processes. The challenge is time and patience. Community processes are slow and often circuitous. Developers are challenged to respond to many and competing voices, and lean on committees and officials to mediate. The other challenge is the investment landscape, which privileges placeless development and quick turn-around times. Roopali Phadke Placeless development leaves us with locations determined by the value we find in them\u2014speculative value, mineral deposits, strategic territory design. Our plans and maps are not illustrations of emotional networks, but deeply divisive contracts of ownership over resources. Gonzalez focuses on Enbridge and the specific issue of the Line 3 project in Minnesota, but such branding that centers on sustainability through the lens of \u201cEconomic Benefits\u201d is widely adopted by oil and gas companies, mining giants, and chemical conglomerates to justify their projects. Defining sustainability ultimately means owning the words to shape this definition. These proprietary definitions can then be used to create smokescreens around corporate strategy as, for example, with the Canadian-initiated Responsible Care\u2122 \u201cglobal product strategy\u201d that was adopted in 1985 by the International Council of Chemical Associations. The Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC)\u00a0describes this Ethic: \u201cThrough Responsible Care\u00ae, CIAC member-companies strive to &#8216;do the right thing and be seen to do the right thing&#8217;.\u201d Such value statements are frequently trademarked. A marketing sleight of hand, a slogan for charitable programs, awards, and children\u2019s educational activities on Earth Day, or World Water Day. Today\u2019s crisis is tomorrow\u2019s woke image management campaign. A curious glance at what\u2019s trending for\u00a0#sustainability\u00a0on Twitter yields a number of companies using the \u201cfindability\u201d of the word to position themselves as thought-leaders and drive traffic to their content. Zurich Insurance introduces carbon-emissions measures for its offices. A Brand Contributor for Bayer writes a think-piece on \u201csustainable agriculture\u201d for\u00a0Forbes\u2019 BRANDVOICE Paid Program. A bottled water company is promoted on finance.yahoo for using aluminum \u201ccustom branded bottles\u201d in which to sell its premium water. This will be a battle of vision. There are many who are quite happy with the status quo and the way they know and enjoy the river. Change is both frightening and seems unnecessary. It\u2019s hard to imagine returning the river to a pre-industrial path. Yet, for many in our communities, especially for native peoples, the built river today is an embodiment of a settler colonial vision that is full of pain. Removing some of the river\u2019s shackles might be an important part of healing our relationships with each other. Roopali Phadke",

On their Sustainability page, Barrick Gold Corp. declares, \u201cBarrick\u2019s sustainability vision is to create long-term value for all our stakeholders\u201d. In the 2018\u00a0Enbridge Sustainability Report, President and CEO Al Monaco defines sustainability as: \u201cfocused on delivering long-term value for our stakeholders\u2014an approach that\u2019s essentially our definition of sustainability in our business.\u201d After defining to whom the definition of sustainability belongs, another question is posed: who belongs in this vision of sustainability? \u201cMy point is,\u201d Al Monaco (or his Communications Manager) writes, \u201cthat this is not an entirely altruistic view. While Enbridge believes that building sustainable relationships with Indigenous Nations connects directly to each of our core values\u2014Integrity, Safety and Respect\u2014we also believe that it is integral to our business case.\u201d Elsewhere,\u00a0Al Monaco writes, \u201cOur relationships with landowners, communities and Indigenous groups are essential to our long-term success\u201d. Of course these relationships are essential to a company\u2019s business case; dissent poses an investment risk, threatens to slow down or cancel projects. Sustainability is the imperative of companies to make superficial adjustments that enable them to influence policy on their terms, and continue making their profits. The supposed rights of Indigenous nations, and the \u201csustainable relationships\u201d that companies like Enbridge build, are seemingly based on a version of collaboration that does not challenge colonial sovereignty, and which does not impede corporate entitlement to profit. In this version, those who are permitted a voice can speak so long as they concede to the economic priorities of big business, so long as their value as workers contributes to the continued exploitation of resources. Such an \u201cimagined future\u201d simply does not permit a world without the Enbridges or Bayers. But what if these businesses and their shareable commitments to sustainability are not welcome? Weaving and Listening In an article titled\u00a0The Environment as Freedom: A Decolonial Reimagining, Malini Ranganathan describes the importance of making atypical connections between environmental justice, and race, class, and gender politics, as an act of decentering white settler narratives and ethical paradigms around land use. \u201cTo remember history is not to lament it,\u201d she writes. \u201cRather, it is to purposefully take stock of the magnitude of damage wrought by various forms of discrimination and to devise interventions that redress the source of that discrimination.\u201d There is a deeply embedded form of violence in the reductive ways in which we perceive and speak about our environments. Binary views place us, as humans, at odds with the intelligence and agency of land. Along with human relations, it is also important to see how the damage of capitalist, colonial extractivism extends to all beings. When they are seen as one vast and singular \u201cland,\u201d plants are made to disappear. They are denied the individuality that is so luxuriously afforded to humanity. When a blade of grass is invisible, rather than uniquely present, it is easier to trample on it.",

Time changes shape and beginnings and endings are remembered in the ancestral memory within my hands and the willow\u2014the willow keeps the time. In this process I am asking the willow to become a basket to hold all kinds of space, life, and death. Each time I weave I feel I am being asked to change form, grow more courageous, emulate the strength and resilience of the willow. The weaving is a prayer for the wildly complex world we are part of. The burial vessels are seeds of beauty and story, woven up and planted as a dream remembering relationships to death and dying, old songs, the way we let our tears overflow and become the waters that also surround our days in rivers, creeks, oceans, estuaries. Soul boats\u2014sailing with the waters the willow soak in, through my hands, and into the hearts, homes, lives of the ones who will fill them. I contemplate the ecology of death and dying and all of the life birthed from the beautifully woven patterns in the baskets. How we as humans participate in the ongoing story of this life and how our tending and transforming in craft/art/beauty strengthens and brings vitality to our human communities and the ecosystems we are a part of. I wonder how my body vessel can be as intricately woven as these baskets and wonder what a human culture would be like that had in its daily rhythm the weaving hands and filling up of such vessels. I continue to ask the question of how the weaving wants to live in these times and how these vessels can be vessels of healing and not perpetuate the same extractive, exploitative, hungry greed within capitalism. I\u2019ve started naming this work post-capitalist cradle and coffin weaving, the work and exchange all within a watershed. I consider how a living weaving practice can bring empowerment and crucial information to the humans around me in relation to the way we come in and the way we go out of this life. Maureen Walrath As a basket-maker, Maureen Walrath\u2019s practice challenges the role of objects we take for granted in a culture of mass-production. Our most vulnerable states, of birth and death\u2014even these are doused with a petrochemical opulence, a lush extractivism. Caskets made of granite and marble, cradles made of plastic, glues made of animals, ancients who buried themselves with trinkets and money. Even at the very edges of our humanity, we are obsessed with consumption. Baskets are symbols of optimism and promise, implying that they can be filled. But this same potential also implies a limit: a basket is only capable of being filled to its specific capacity. The promise of abundance is bound to the vessel\u2019s ability to contain it.",

To\u00a0disappear\u00a0land, as if\u00a0to disappear someone, alluding to a politically motivated crime, a secret execution. By removing land, what is left underfoot? How do we rebuild relationships with something that we are actively disappearing? What part of ourselves do we give back to the land? By seeing extractive methods as criminal acts, by aligning with ethics that see capitalist extraction as a form of environmental genocide, what possibility does this open for human responsibility to the land we inhabit? In her book entitled\u00a0Braiding Sweetgrass, Robin Wall Kimmerer writes about what we can learn from observing lichen. \u201cTheir success is measured not by consumption and growth,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut by graceful longevity and simplicity, by persistence when the world changed around them.\u201d Do we dare give power to plants? To see objects not as products of materials or resources, but composed of many bodies of knowledge? \u201cOur indigenous herbalists say pay attention when plants come to you,\u201d writes Kimmerer, \u201cthey\u2019re bringing you something you need to learn.\u201d In a culture that listens to the non-human, art becomes a form of quoting their wisdom. I am continually forming and reforming answers to this question and how it relates to colonization, supremacy, and the intergenerational trauma living in this place, the so-called United States of America; and how my daily life choices and movements potentially contribute to the perpetuation of settler mentality, or work to dismantle settler mentality and heal. How to be in place, part of a place, to be a place? I\u2019ve been asking, what does it mean to be fully alive in a place, to move with and learn from the rhythms of the seasons among and with other humans, and within the lives of all beings. In A Wizard of Earthsea, Ursula K. Le Guin speaks to the intimate relationship with plants, fictional or not: \u2018When you know the fourfoil in all its seasons root and leaf and flower, by sight and scent and seed, then you may learn its true name, knowing its being: which is more than its use.\u2019 Being in a place means learning its true name. Being in a place means listening to the language that has been there and is there\u2014human and non-human. Learn the names of the rivers and creeks, and the names they had before those names. To be in a place is to be a part of the body of a place; slow down and quiet long enough to form a relationship with fully embodied sensual awareness. As a human, to be in a place means we can listen for what is needed and respond\u2014whether in song, stillness, planting seeds, cooking, making art, weaving, making love, expressing anger, grieving, showing up, or coming together. Maureen Walrath What if we are to radically change the way we see space\u2014relating to an environment not as a demarcated location, but an aggregated presence of a multitude of individuals? Not a lifeless combination of coordinates, but a moving, breathing, sensing crowd that we encounter, attune to, interact with? Not as a territory to be owned, but as a living and sensing being, or plenitude of beings? Then, as with any consensual relationship, we cannot assume that we can take; we must seek permission from these multitudes. And perhaps, they will say to us,\u00a0no. Re-wilding depends on perspective\u2014are we referring to large ecosystems with/without humans or the act of rewilding one\u2019s self. I think the answer creates a different sensibility. Since so much has been written about rewilding landscapes, like reintroducing predators, I\u2019ll make it more personal. For me, rewilding is about seeing where wildness already exists within and around us and cultivating the wildness you seek in the world. This can be tending a surly garden or adventuring beyond one\u2019s creature comforts. In the case of the Mississippi, it can mean imagining a river without walls and then helping bring that into being again. Roopali Phadke We may not be prepared for this. It would require of us to collaborate, bond, and make friendship with our environments. We already know that plants respond to touch, to singing and music, to animate and lively spaces\u2014brushed and misted, moving with the movement of the world. There is trauma buried into generations of plants, from the rumbling of heavy machinery, the automated blades of ploughs, the choking exhaust, and leaking contaminants. As if having learned the burden of a friend, we must struggle with what do with this information. But is this not also a science? This spring of curiosity and responsibility is the very beginning of science. This root of empathy muddies the headwaters, mystifying the terms with which we can create our coming beginnings.",

Another approach to modeling\u2014again from the 1970s\u2014not only seems to acknowledge the criticism that has been provoked by these world models, but also appears as a reaction to some general \u201cneo-catastrophic\u201dJon Agar, Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond. Cambridge: Polity Press, 2012, p. 429. trends in scientific theory of the 1960s. For example in evolutionary biology, paleontology, astronomy, or the climate sciences, theories were proposed that featured violent change and shock, or emphasized unexpected surprises and fundamental uncertainties in relation to complex dynamic systems. Edwards Lorenz\u2019 Chaos Theory or Ren\u00e9 Thom\u2019s Catastrophe Theory are just two examples with broad applications across different disciplines. One conclusion drawn from these theoretical foundations was the recognition of some general limits to planning and prediction and the \u201cwicked\u201d nature of some problems. The Canadian ecologist Crawford S. Holling explicitly acknowledged this situation both in his theoretical approach to ecosystems as well as in his methods to manage them. In his widely cited paper \u201cResilience and Stability of Ecosystems\u201d he developed a perspective that no longer focused on notions of \u201cequilibrium\u201d or \u201cbalance of nature,\u201d but in which, instead, he defined the complex measure of resilience that can account for the ability of an ecosystem to remain cohesive even while undergoing strong perturbations. In Holling\u2019s systems thinking, \u201cthe constancy of [the systems\u2019] behavior becomes less important than the persistence of the relationships.\u201dC. S. Holling, \u201cResilience and Stability of Ecosystems,\u201d Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, vol. 4 (1973): pp. 1\u201223. Within such a framework, the primary objective is not the maintenance of either a certain status quo or the adherence to global goals but, in line with other pioneers of the Anthropocene, Holling understood development as arising from the coevolutionary interplay of environmental and social systems. Thus, while previous models and environmental assessments have provided mainly static \u201csnapshots\u201d of the world, modeling, in contrast, should enable actors to actively engage with (eco)systems to allow for coevolutionary development. As professor and director of the Institute of Animal Resource Ecology at the University of British Columbia, and especially as head of the Ecology Project at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Holling invented processes of adaptive environmental assessment and management, which earned him a wide professional following beyond that of the environmental sciences. The adaptive management process consists of a carefully designed series of alternating workshops and research periods in which scientists from different disciplines, policymakers, and other stakeholders come together. Systems analysts helped to identify the various aspects of a problem, translated them into variables and integrated them into a model, with which the participants play in order to explore the potential impacts of different policy options, the sensitivity of the system under observation, and the sensitivity of the simulation model itself. Models used to foster such learning experience were understood as evolving devices of self-instruction. The value of the model \u201cis not so much to give answers as to generate better questions,\u201d Holling and his colleague wrote.C. S. Holling and A. D. Chambers, \u201cResource Science. The Nurture of an Infant,\u201d\u00a0BioScience, vol. 23, no. 1 (1973): pp. 13\u201220. During the 1970s, adaptive management was tested in numerous different case studies addressing complexities that systems analysts tended to ignore by then\u2014multiple conflicting decision-makers, multiple conflicting objectives, intertemporal and intergenerational trade-offs, and the design of strategies that deal with the irreducible uncertainty of the real world, for example by avoiding premature foreclosure of options and by developing policies that are as robust, viz. resilient, as ecosystems. One study was conducted in cooperation with the Alpine Research Center of Innsbruck University, the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the inhabitants of Obergurgl, a Tyrolean Alpine village that the researchers presented as a microcosm for the problem of economic growth in relation to limited ecological and social resources.",

The model structured the workshop series and stood at the center of negotiations between the different stakeholders. Holling summarized the process: \u201cIts purpose was to examine the likely consequences of several options available for this high alpine region of Austria: zoning changes, building subsidy or taxation, ski-lift construction. In a 5-day workshop a model was built, and the alternative futures under the different options were examined. The results of this exercise became a topic of major consideration in the region, and we believe they made a significant impact on decision-making. After a 1-day planning meeting, a core group of 5 methodologists and 15 participants met for a 1-week workshop. [. . .] Several important problems were defined and clarified by the Obergurgl model. The initial concerns about environmental quality receded to minor significance. Of more concern was the obvious inability of the village to maintain its current style of life, which is associated with continued growth of the hotel industry. The land will run out; subsidization, taxation, and zoning changes can only alter the date. When the Obergurglers returned to their village after the workshop, they initiated a series of public discussions about the future of the village. [\u2026] The need for a change in lifestyle and expectations became obvious to many of the villagers; the search for a solution began.\u201dC. S. Holling (ed.),\u00a0Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management. Chichester: John Wiley, 1978, pp. 43\u20124. In this participatory approach to adaptive local management, models are essentially embedded in a collective process. Models are not just representations of the world, but platforms for an adaptive engagement with changing environments and understood as tools of self-instruction and collective learning about complex systems and their possible future trajectories. They structure language, coordinate people, and help to make robust decisions that help ecosystems to retain resilience.",

The one constant presence since the glaciers retreated some 12,000 years ago, the Mississippi River that courses by the former barge shipping terminal, out of use since 2014, has been part of the river\u2019s migratory bird flyway from the earliest of days. It has borne countless American Indian canoes and hosted their encampments along its banks. It guided the earliest European explorers upstream above St. Anthony Falls to lay claim to the lands of the Dakota and Ojibwe peoples. Little evidence remains of the log booms, sawmills, and other early businesses that once crowded the river above the falls. With commercial barge shipping now ceased, the UHT and other barge terminals are being demolished. The river remains, waiting for the next episode of human occupation. Many different development plans and approaches have been proposals, vying with one another to shape this next instalment. In considering any of them, we should ask what will our relationship to the one constant\u2014the Mississippi River\u2014look like in the twenty-first century era of the Anthropocene? The Mississippi River has been both a professional and personal passion of mine for more than three decades. One of my great frustrations is the disconnect between what people say about the Mississippi River and how they treat it. Nearly everyone who writes about the Mississippi or who has plans for the land along it, refers to it as an \u201cicon,\u201d the \u201cMighty Mississippi,\u201d the \u201cGreat River,\u201d one of the world\u2019s greatest rivers. But if asked to revise or adapt their plans to be worthy of such a treasure, too often they would prefer that it be great, mighty, or iconic \u2026somewhere else. My vision is for a development that truly embraces the river\u2019s significance. I believe such a vision could serve everyone, although everyone may not get everything they want. Many see the UHT site as a blank slate. In my experience, such opportunities lead to the most contested of places, as people with competing interests see an opportunity to implement or promote their vision of the river\u2019s future place in society, whether for their own profit or for some greater social good.",

Recognizing the Mississippi River\u2019s importance to the Twin Cities\u2019 local and national identity, river advocates convinced Governor Wendell Anderson to designate 72 miles of the river flowing through the Twin Cities as a State Critical Area in 1976. They won even greater recognition in 1988, when Congress added those 72 miles to the National Park System as the Mississippi NRRA. The NPS preserves America\u2019s greatest and most significant places, and the Mississippi NRRA is the only national park whose mission is protecting and enhancing the Mississippi River. The Mississippi NRRA has various stories and landscapes, but those of the Mississippi River around the UHT contribute to our national narrative and to America\u2019s national identity, which is why it was established by congress. With 48 acres and one mile of riverfront, the development opportunity presented by the UHT\u2019s closing will have profound implications for the Mississippi River and the national park. That is why the NPS is engaged in the conversation about its future. Unlike rural sites such as the larger, western national parks or eastern national battlefields, the Mississippi NRRA must define its own identity as a national park. One way of doing so is to become a model of world-class river development. Cities along the Mississippi NRRA\u2019s corridor have an opportunity to exhibit the highest and best practices of planning, design, and civic engagement, with the NPS demanding the excellence it expects of developments within its network\u2014such as those at the National Mall and Memorials, the Grand Canyon, Gettysburg, Mesa Verde, and Yellowstone. We will continue to expect excellence of our newest park units, like the monuments to Stonewall, C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez, and Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers, as well as here along the Mississippi. The Mississippi NRRA runs through one of the most unique reaches of the entire Mississippi River. Nowhere along its 2,350-mile course does it change more dramatically over such a short distance. The Mississippi enters from the north as a prairie river. Throughout this reach, the land runs up to the river\u2019s banks, not bluffs. It has a couple dozen islands and little floodplain. At St. Anthony Falls, the Mississippi dives into a narrow 8.5-mile gorge, dropping more than 110 feet. The large-floodplain river begins at the mouth of the Minnesota River and extends far to the south. This is the river made renowned by Mark Twain, characterized by a broad valley and a wide floodplain, with many side channels, backwater lakes, wetlands, and wooded islands. The UHT lies along the prairie river, and so site and building design should flow from the prairie river and the history the place has seen.",

                "text": "Future plans and the future of planning Despite objections from neighborhood residents and local organizations, the City of Minneapolis unanimously approved a concept plan that calls for three structures: a Community Performing Arts Center (CPAC), an innovation hub, and a hospitality center or hotel. Other than for the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board\u2019s plans, none of the designs or presentations have shown any intentional inspiration or interest related to the Mississippi River. Instead, each of the CPAC, innovation hub, and hospitality center could be located on any street or boulevard. Everyone wants North Minneapolis to thrive, but success will bring change to the adjoining neighborhoods. Planning must consider the community\u2019s needs while knowing that the community will likely change over the coming decades. Whatever gets built will inevitably shape the neighborhoods and their relationship to the river, which means the city needs to plan not only for the current neighborhoods, but for those of tomorrow. RiverFirst\u2014the city\u2019s master plan for the Mississippi River above St. Anthony Falls\u2014insists that \u201cour community will redefine our region\u2019s relationship to the river and transform the Upper Mississippi Riverfront into a regional economic engine and world-class cultural and recreational destination.\u201d\u201cRiverFirst.\u201d Minneapolis Parks Foundation, Aug 23, 2019: mplsparksfoundation.org/riverfirst/ But a strip of parkland, buffering the river from a development indifferent to the Mississippi River, does not redefine the city\u2019s or the region\u2019s relationship to the river. It speaks more of the twentieth century than the twenty-first. Some elements of the concept plan are not inherently problematic. A performing arts venue could draw thousands of visitors; a community innovation hub could be a catalyst for positive cultural and economic connections in adjoining neighborhoods; a hospitality center, when and if needed, could be an economic boon to the area; affordable housing and business offices located on the site\u2019s west side reduce impacts to the areas nearest the river and are critical to north Minneapolis\u2019s economic and social well-being; the parkland running along the Mississippi and woven into the site will connect people to the river; and the City and Park and Recreation Board have formed citizen advisory committees to gather more community input. However, RiverFirst\u2019s vision begs defining what constitutes an economic engine. Prior economic engines that drove commerce above the falls are gone or going. Beginning in the 1860s, timber fueled the first era, based on the fiction of an inexhaustible supply of timber, but that timber ran out. The boom was good while it lasted, propelling Minneapolis to the forefront of lumber production in the United States, providing jobs for many and great wealth for a few. No lumber mills remain, their presence erased by the early 1920s. Opening in 1968, the UHT was also based on a fiction: the idea that Minneapolis could be the commercial navigation bookend to New Orleans. This dream ignored the physical reality of the Mississippi River above its confluence with the Minnesota River. The river through Minneapolis is too narrow and the locks too small to achieve the economies of scale needed to vie with other modes of shipping. Unlike lumber, commercial navigation never flourished in the 52 years between the opening of the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and the lock\u2019s closure by an Act of Congress in 2015. City officials and developers see the performing arts center as the new economic engine\u2014the new main attraction\u2014but what is the foundation for this thinking? Timber and barge terminals needed the river, though they demanded substantial sacrifices from it. The CPAC, innovation hub, and hospitality center as currently proposed do not need the Mississippi River, although the new developments could leverage the river\u2019s presence to sell their plans more easily and profitably.",

The US Army Corps of Engineers no longer dredges the channel; massive, diesel-powered towboat propellers no longer tear up the river bottom; the river\u2019s bed is returning to a more natural landscape, creating new habitats for mussels, aquatic vegetation, fish, and other species. The hope is that any new development brings recovery and resilience to the adjoining neighborhoods and introduces local residents and visitors to a twenty-first-century relationship with America\u2019s greatest river. Such a relationship would include: a design that considers the health of the river and its adjoining lands above any given development; planning sensitive to the impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, socially, economically, and environmentally; and architectural and landscape design flowing from the location on the river and its history. Addressing the problems of the Anthropocene is about scale. Positive individual actions, at specific sites, can only make a difference if repeated across large landscapes. With what it does at the UHT site, Minneapolis has a chance to export a new relationship with the Mississippi River to other sites along this river and to rivers around the world.",

For this reason, the most challenging aspects of doing Anthropocene research require engaging with local situations and communities; learning from on-site realities and how they might inform broader global issues rather than flattening out place, position, or power from what is being studied. Exploring this relational asymmetry, the first conversation of The Shape of a Practice took place between two very different regions that are experiencing transformations in social and political life, prompted by the multiple disasters that are the Anthropocene. These include changing landscapes, a reckoning with the legacies of colonialism and racial inequality, the effects of deindustrialization, and the asymmetries of risk and equity they produce. These thoughts bring the conversation to two very different places where the effects of each of these transformations on the global stage produce poly-crisis which play out in radically different ways, first in the Lausitz region of Germany and second in the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota in the US. In this archived stream, artist and researcher John Kim opens a portal on site in the city of Minneapolis, US, with a discussion about From Emergency to Emergence, a series of workshops and conversations in the aftermath of the recent uprisings and protests that concern the poly-crisis of racial inequality, a global pandemic, and ecological destruction, which have laid bare the failures of US governance to provide for the basic human need to ensure life. Focused on activist practices of solidarity and mutual aid, the series seeks to reveal how such activities offer new models and modes of self-governance and political autonomy. Back in Berlin, sociologist Jeremias Herberg discusses the coal region of Lausitz in Germany, which has a long history of post-socialist change, coal extraction and populist mobilization. In light of the governments\u2019 plan to phase out coal by 2038, his team at IASS Potsdam has engaged in a critical, facilitative and catalytic role to discuss and collectively transform those legacies in close collaboration with local partners.",

The change of climatic dynamics has caused, for instance, an increase in bushfires in Queensland, the northern tropical part of Australia. The cause for this rise in temperatures and droughts underpinning this anthropocenic phenomenon is the increasing emissions of carbon that have altered the climate itself. The main activities of ACM18 have not only taken place in Deakin University\u2019s downtown Burwood Campus, but also led us to the so-called Docklands.

With respect to its philosophical meaning, the elemental signifies categories from which every other material derives, but which are not derivatives themselves. Neale made explicit reference to Aristotle, who used the same four elements which have shaped the core of ACM18. The theme Elemental captures something tangible about the world and yet, at the same time, remains excessive to human agency. Indeed, human agency often has had to chase after the elemental. In other words, equating humans in the Anthropocene to a geological force means that the natural elements cannot be under the direct control of our species.",

The prospect of increasingly frequent droughts, higher temperatures, and windier seasonal weather are the climatic characteristics that have determined the rate of fire emergence in Australia. Given by professionals who directly handle the challenges the Anthropocene has brought, the presentations on fire illustrated the impact of climate change on Australian lands. After Neale\u2019s opening speech, Professor Lesley Head, who leads the School of Geography at Melbourne University, took to the floor to tell the story of \u201cTypha, the Once and Future Planty Companion.\u201d Lesley Head invoked a new appraisal of both Typha as a sustainable crop and of the knowledge and practices of the indigenous people of Australia, mainly by focusing on the relationship between the Typha plant\u2014also known as Cattail\u2014and the Aborigines who use it for many purposes. Typha can indeed adapt well in wetlands and, at the same time, be used both as a food and as a weaving material for ropes and clothes. Further, it serves as a building material due to its compressive strength and its heat-, fire-, and noise insulation abilities. Another key lecture titled \u201cThe Anthropocene In and Within the Cell,\u201d given by Professor Hannah Landecker\u2014head of the Institute for Society and Genetics at University of California Los Angeles\u2014took place in the Library at The Dock, one of Melbourne\u2019s public libraries. Landecker suggested that, similar to paleontologists\u2019 treatment of rock strata\u2014where researchers can \u201cread\u201d major climatic changes that have happened over the course of millennia\u2014the metabolism, observable from within the cells of organisms, can be considered a record of what has happened in the environment. The lecture was a proposal for metabolic strata and metabolic ethics. Landecker\u2019s main insight with regard to the Anthropocene concerns the logics beyond the production and use of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics by the agribusiness industry. This is rooted in a deterministic take on genetics, which runs counter to the logics developed in the biological, environmental, and epidemiologic sciences since at least a century ago, as exemplified by the research field of epigenetics.",

In contrast to other scholars at the ACM18 who have been hesitant to point to the political and economic roots of scientific institutions, Rickard openly acknowledges the geopolitical context and the political premises, such as merchant capitalism, that have allowed the emergence of a new calculative, risk-taking attitude toward the future. Analyses like the one proposed by Rickards are especially useful for understanding the Anthropocene in its longue dur\u00e9e and, at the same time, are fruitful to developing solutions of a social and political nature. Professor David Turnbull, head of the Science and Technology Studies (STS) program at Deakin University, gave a lecture titled \u201cOut of Africa and into the Amazonas: Nonlinear Anthropocene Narratives of Movement and territorialization.\u201d He has shown the need to conceive the Anthropocene in a different way by taking into consideration the many agencies represented by the various autochthone populations: For instance, those in the Amazonas, which guarantee climatic equilibrium at a global scale through their adaption of specific values and practices of land management. On a theoretical level, Turnbull pointed to the \u201cOut of Africa\u201d hypothesis of the African multiregionalists. According to this theory, the competing model of the \u201ctree of life\u201d that suggests that all living beings descended from one type of cell or organism (as proposed by Darwin) must be changed. Specifically, Turnbull analyzed this subject matter through the scholarship of American microbiologist Carl Woese and evolutionary and molecular biologist Ford Doolittle, both of whose theories were underpinned by the mechanism of horizontal gene transfer. Professor Margaret Jolly\u2014from the Australian National University (ANU) College of Asia and the Pacific\u2014delivered one of the ACM18\u2019s final key lectures titled \u201cEngendering the Anthropocene,\u201d which showed evidence that the effects of the Anthropocene are more devastating in the Pacific than in other places. Jolly has developed a critique concerning the big institutions of capitalist countries, which she argues have placed responsibility for solving the problems of the Anthropocene on the shoulders of women without considering other structural aspects. She pointed out how the United Nations\u2019 entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women\u2014UN Women\u2014considers women\u2019s distinctive role in society as a resource for the adaptation to and management of the effects of climate change. In this context, Jolly referred to the work of Bernadette Resurrecci\u00f3n, who has shown how Eurocentric conceptions of women as being closer to nature than men, occludes an analysis of the distant causes of the Anthropocene, such as fossil-fueled economies. In effect, women are assigned the dual role of climate victims and powerful agents of change.",

                "text": "Another occasion to witness the scope of the Anthropocene was the public conversation led by professor of Anthropology Eben Kirksey with artist Patricia Piccinini and synthetic biologist Claudia Vickers. The tension between the positions of Piccinini and Vickers concerned, on the one hand, the aims of technology and on the other, the aesthetics of art, which veer into opposite directions. Indeed, the fact that technology cares neither for the environment nor for the survival of organisms is an ever-present issue in most of Piccinini\u2019s work. One of her pieces, titled Bootflower, featured in the exhibition M/Others and Future Humans at the Testing Grounds space. The closing lecture of ACM18 was by Karen Barad\u2014Professor of Feminist Studies, Philosophy, and History of Consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In her talk titled \u201cAfter the End of the World: Transmutation of the Elements, Radioactive Refugeeism, and Alchemical Wonderism,\u201d Barad told the story of the nuclear and thermonuclear blasts operated by the United States Government and authorized by the United Nations in the Pacific islands. What she demonstrated was that the nucleus of the atom holds an implosion of multilayered violent legacies, those of colonialism, racism, extractive capitalism, militarism, and neocolonialism. These elements have disrupted the lives of people who still live and have lived on the Pacific islands and who have repeatedly experienced the undoing of atomic power and its related legacies. The diverse activities of ACM18 have demonstrated the controversial \u201cnature\u201d of the Anthropocene. For some, its inception is marked through the onset of industrial, capitalist activities rooted in the extraction and use of fossil fuels or in the beginnings of the agribusiness industry and the related mass-use of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. Then again, for others the Anthropocene began with the nuclear fallout produced by the militaries during the Cold War or with the colonial extermination of autochthon civilizations that, for centuries and through specific practices of land management, have allowed stable patterns of climatic equilibrium. As an occasion to gather different and informed points of view from the public, activists, experts, and artists, ACM18 consolidated the debate on the Anthropocene in locations often outside academia. ACM18 facilitated the public sharing, extension, and enrichment of imaginaries and highlighted the concerns, controversies, experiences, reflections, and sustainable futures in order that we are better able to face the growing disruption of the elemental we are currently witnessing.",

The social history turn of the 1960s still remains at the center of the discipline, although reconfigured by the linguistic and cultural turns. The gender turn has also dramatically reshaped the core of the discipline, as has the post-colonial. More recently the imperial and global turns have had a profound and widespread impact. Environmental history has not had a similar impact because, in contrast to other recent turns , the environmental has not produced a powerful theoretical statement on the centrality of its perspective for making sense of history as a whole. This lecture provides a way out of this impasse. It presents a framework for putting the natural world at the center of the writing of history for it argues that without nature historians cannot understand time. And where is history without time?",

The advent of the environmental sciences secularized those histories, postulating new causal and consequential connections between nature and humanity. The Anthropocene is but the latest of the narratives that tie the laws of the Earth to the activities of nature\u2019s most interventionist offspring: the human species. In this talk, Sheila Jasanoff traces the modern scientific narratives of human-nature relationships through the parallel lens of environmental law. She asks what difference the concept of the Anthropocene\u2014in particular, its embrace of the geologic timescale\u2014makes to our notions of responsibility toward a planet that we not only inhabit but also consume and transform through human enterprise.",

In 1965, however, hope appeared on the horizon in the form of Hurricane Betsy, a Gulf Coast-leveling storm that set the standard as the world\u2019s first billion-dollar weather event. Today, a billion-dollar storm might not even make the headlines. Since 2000, the minimum annual cost of disaster losses globally has been $62 billion. In 2011, the 3/11 Japanese Triple Disaster cost $105 billion bringing the total cost of disasters for the year to an eye-popping $463 billion. Emergency managers, the UN, and relief agencies look at these numbers and rightfully see the increasing misery of the world\u2019s disaster-affected populations.

A QUICK primer: insurance is a financial in-strument, purchased by both private and public actors, designed to provide financial reimbursement in the event of a loss. Reinsurance is a financial instrument that provides insurance for insurers \u2012 allowing institutions that broker large quantities of risk to minimize their exposure in the event of high-loss years. Reinsurance companies make up some of the largest financial services players in the world today: firms like Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, and Willis Re are solid fixtures in the reinsurance market, selling reinsurance to governments and to retail insurance companies. Anthro-Re markets to these traditional customers; in addition, it allows the private consumer the opportunity to get in on the exciting and lucrative market in global disaster-risk speculation.",

But once in a while academics come up with something applicable in the insurance world, and the recent scholarship on the \u201cAnthropocene\u201d is one of those. If you think it sounds like a geological term, well, you\u2019re right. The Anthropocene, put simply, is a new geological epoch: a period marked out by the imprint of human activity on the Earth. Humans have been around for 200,000 years, but in the last sixty years, we have managed to become the most dominant force in the global ecosystem. We have altered the carbon cycle, the water cycle, the nitrogen cycle, and the phosphorus cycle. We are making the oceans more acidic. We are driving the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth. The fifth, 65 million years ago, killed the dinosaurs. These facts in and of themselves are interesting to all of those people who are locked in ivory towers, but they are hardly marketable. The crucial insight comes when we think about the risk-creation mechanisms of the Anthropocene. To take climate change as only one example; the Anthropocene is an era of unpredictability and volatility in global systems \u2012 driven by our economic choices. Weather and climate, infrastructure and energy, human health and migration \u2012 in each of these areas the Anthropocene will see disasters on a scale unprecedented prior to this point in human history.",

Human activity has now dissolved the line between the natural and the man-made. The economic impacts are startling, and worth our attention. In 2013, disasters globally cost $198 billion. Out of these direct economic losses, insured losses reached $48 billion. Insured losses over the past 15 years range between a quarter and one-third of the total economic losses from global disasters. Notice from these statistics that there is a vast difference between the cost of disasters and the insured losses from disasters. This gap offers two types of opportunity. First, risk is increasing! In the aggregate, actual loss-amounts indicate a global trend towards spiraling disaster costs. Infrastructure damage, crop losses, personal injury, and death: each of these is an area where consumers in every sector feel fear, and this fear motivates the purchase of insurance. But, there is another, more subtle factor here. In the space between real losses and insured losses, we also see the real chance for market success, as most disaster losses will never be reimbursed through Insurance. In other words, the desire for insurance is rising, and yet the global-risk system is too complex for the average consumer, or even the average treasury, to understand. Global-disaster anxiety provides the basis for the market. To capitalize, reinsurance keeps one foot in this realm of anxiety, while the other foot leaps boldly ahead into scientific risk avoidance. Successful reinsurance companies effectively anticipate disaster anxiety, while using our scientific knowledge of risk probability to avoid (to the greatest extent possible) getting caught in the \u201creimbursement zone.\u201d",

The fact is that the big reinsurance companies, like the governments and insurance companies they insure, are trapped in pre-Anthropocene thinking. Their risk models look at climate change as a black box. They have not yet considered the new financial instruments (instruments that will be risky and will need reinsurance) that could help reduce risk for dryland farmers, to take one example. They have not looked closely at the possibilities for monetizing mass migrations of people as the result of drought and drought-induced warfare. They have no capacity to think of disasters as compound occurrences \u2012 like the earthquake\u2012tsunami\u2012nuclear disaster experienced in Japan in 2011. And, most importantly, they see disasters as \u201cevents,\u201d with a beginning, middle, and end. The reality is that disaster is now a permanent condition \u2012 a slow and steady accumulation of financial losses that will unfold over centuries. By shifting our business model to meet this new environmental reality, Anthro-Re is an innovator. The Anthropocene is real, so let\u2019s monetize it.

                "text": "Emerging and Submerging Markets It has become clear that sea levels are rising as the result of climate change and glacial melt. This rise is slow but perceptible, occurring at an average rate of about 0.14 inches (3.5 mm) per year since the early 1990s. As sea levels change, some parts of the world will find themselves submerged. Others will acquire new territory as the result of glacial melt, or new oceanfront property as the result of changing sea levels. Populations will move away from submerging markets and toward emerging ones. Anthro-Re offers reinsurance for submerging and emerging markets. + Coastal Cities \u2012 Submerging The first sign of a submerging market is frequent or more intense flooding. In 2008, Venice experienced its worst flood in twenty years, with water nearly waist-deep in St Mark\u2019s Square. With rising temperatures and sea levels and increasing storm intensity it won\u2019t be long until this record is surpassed. Miami Beach has become notorious for flooding during high tide, even in the absence of storms, and this flooding is only getting worse. Flooding in coastal cities increases risk for residents and industry alike, and the tourist industry stands to be particularly hard hit as many of these cities stand to lose their status as prime vacation spots. Currently, governments are the main providers of flood insurance, as traditionally this area has been seen as too risky for the private insurance market. By offering reinsurance for coastal city flood policies, Anthro-Re seeks to both monetize this growing risk and increase the availability of coverage. + Coastal Cities \u2012 Emerging As sea levels continue to rise, the old coastal cities will submerge and new ones will emerge. For example, when Santa Monica goes under, Pasadena may find itself with a new coastline, and national and local governments and business interests will want to quickly develop and monetize newly created oceanfront properties. Anthro-Re offers a product to governments in regions that may experience the emergence of new coastal cities. When the time comes, wealthy populations and tourist industries will move from submerging to emerging coastal cities. In other cases, governments will build coastal economies from scratch if the country currently has no coastline. These movements and associated construction will require insurance. The long and uncertain time horizon on sea-level change means that investors could be collecting money on these insurance products for decades before reimbursement becomes a possibility. + Immigration Insurance While many large coastal cities can be insured against flooding, most small island states cannot, and will soon be underwater. However, Anthro-Re offers a product to insure other governments against the risks and costs of the growing number of climate refugees who it is predicted will seek settlement as their countries are submerged. Europe has already been inundated with refugees from Syria, Eritrea, and elsewhere as the result of ongoing climate-induced warfare. Climate change will only exacerbate this problem as refugees from small island states join the stream of migration, not only to Europe, but also to North America and particularly Australia. Settling refugees is costly and potentially dangerous, yet turning them away is also costly, both financially and politically. With immigration insurance from Anthro-Re, governments can rest assured that when the masses arrive, they will have the resources to deal with them, one way or another. + Post-Glacier Settlement As glaciers melt and global temperatures rise, land currently covered by ice will become available for human settlement, and may prove to be prime farmland as the aridity line moves farther north. Governments will want to be prepared to take advantage of these lands as soon as they come available, both to resettle coastal or refugee populations and to build new agricultural economies as our current agricultural lands become desert. Anthro-Re\u2019s post-glacier settlement product will provide governments with the resources they need to develop these markets as they emerge.",

                "text": "+ The Drought Opportunity Zone Farmers and pastoralists, especially those engaged in dryland farming and herding, are understandably risk averse. Such farmers plant the most reliable crops \u2012 and for that reason, while they may not starve, nor are they earning as much from their land as might be possible were they willing to accept more risk of crop failure. The same holds true for the more conservative pastoralists. According to the World Bank, \u201cagricultural insurance could complement mitigation and coping mechanisms by both reducing vulnerability and providing a foundation for production-boosting investments in agriculture. This scheme could help to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty.\u201d Over recent years, there have been many pilot agricultural and pastoral insurance projects in East Africa, but success has proven limited. Dryland insurance in such economically challenged zones relies on successful public\u2012private partnerships. What has been missing thus far is the presence of a competent institution in the middle providing data and financial resources \u2012 and this is where the Anthro-Re Dryland Reinsurance Product comes into play. Governments, the UN, retail insurers, and private agricultural mutual associations could use this product to bolster their agricultural insurance investments.

In the Anthropocene, \u201ccats\u201d are catastrophes and \u201ccat lovers\u201d are reinsurance companies that bond with them through financial instruments called CAT bonds. CAT bonds are a mechanism through which financial markets can provide high returns \u2012 in the order of 9% \u2012 by speculating on large-scale natural catastrophes. This is becoming big business. In April 2014, Florida\u2019s insurer of last resort issued the largest ever CAT bond for a cool $1.5 billion. In the same year, the African Union issued a $1 billion CAT bond covering climate-related extreme events. In 2013, New York shut the stable door after the proverbial horse had bolted when it issued a $200 million CAT bond following Hurricane Sandy. So how does a CAT bond work? Imagine you are a large Asian city, let\u2019s say Manila. Let\u2019s say for the fifth year in a row the strongest typhoon in the history of meteorology is about to crush you. In the past, you\u2019d have had to deal with it. Not now. With Anthro-Re, you could issue a CAT bond; let\u2019s say for $1 billion. You sell your bonds up to $1 billion on the international market. Investors can buy the bonds on the promise of a whopping annual return on investment. If the typhoon decides to cruise by Manila, investors cash in. But if the typhoon crashes through Manila, the CAT bond helps deal with the insurance claims (and investors lose). + CAT Gambling CAT bonds can be issued for earthquakes, hurricanes, droughts, floods, you name it. They are purchased by pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and wealthy individuals, eager for high returns, and willing to take a chance. We\u2019re looking at you Warren Buffet. We establish stringent parameters for our CAT bonds. If certain pre-agreed conditions are met, if the typhoon reaches a specific wind speed, if the area affected is specified in the terms of the agreement, if the typhoon hits within the specified period, then an investor loses. If these conditions are not met and the typhoon causes no insurable losses, then the investor wins. The more Anthro-Re knows about the weather (and we know a LOT) the more likely we can offer investors betting opportunities such as these, without Anthro-Re coming up on the wrong side of the catastrophe.",

In this image, we try to move away from the Romantic ideal\u2014represented here by an emblematic image of Loweswater in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England\u2014which is iconic of a conceptualization of nature as benign, harmonious, and beautiful. This interpretation, which in part can be traced back to the eighteenth-century \u201cLake Poets\u201d such as William Wordsworth or Thomas De Quincey, is today perpetuated through the Lake District tourism industry as well as nature-conservation strategies.One might even see this type of \u201cperfect nature\u201d indirectly or unintentionally invoked in certain types of imaginations of low-carbon futures. See Leigh Martindale, \u201cUnderstanding Humans in the Anthropocene: Finding answers in geoengineering and transition towns,\u201d Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, vol. 33, no. 5 (2015): pp. 907\u201224. Moving away from nature and the wild as picturesque and smooth, we engage with the geological and the processes of formation that have contributed to making the Lake District what it is today, but which are missing from the Romantic frame. Examples include the Ordovician supervolcano that produced eruptions on a scale to rival Toba and shaped many of its current hills and rock formations, the now nonexistent glaciers that carved its valleys, the Neolithic stone-axe factory that tapped a particular layer of volcanic ash, the graphite mineral discovered in the sixteenth century that led to the eventual globalization of the pencil and, indirectly, towards development of the new \u201cwonder material\u201d graphene, and the agricultural imprint left on the landscape through the clearing of the forests and the impact this has had on responses to climate change, particularly increased flooding. Contrary to the popular notion of the Lakes as a \u201cnatural\u201d landscape, George Monbiot introduced an ecological perspective when he reacted to the Lake District\u2019s nomination as a World Heritage Site by coining the area a \u201cwildlife desert.\u201dGeorge Monbiot, \u201cClimate change? Try catastrophic climate breakdown,\u201d\u00a0The Guardian (September 27, 2013), online (accessed 11/07/2015).\u00a0In a similar way, this picture takes up Kathryn Yusoff\u2019sKathryn Yusoff, \u201cGeologic Life: Prehistory, climate, futures in the Anthropocene,\u201d\u00a0Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, vol. 31, no. 5 (2013): pp. 779\u201295.\u00a0invitation in which she, among others, recommends thinking of the Anthropocene as a \u201cgeological turn,\u201d recognizing Anthropos\u2019 indebtedness to earthly and nonhuman processes. The background image, representing \u201cdeep time\u201d and the interconnectedness of the Earth\u2019s processes, is the \u201cgolden spike\u201d in Zumaia (the Basque country, northern Spain), one of only a few places on Earth where the K-T Boundary is visible.An iridium spike represents the catastrophic event caused by collision with a meteorite: the \u201cnuclear winter,\u201d provoked by the ash and debris of the impact, brought about extinction of the dominant land animal of the time, the dinosaurs.\u00a0The image also depicts Milankovitch cycles recorded in rhythmic sedimentary layering in the flysch. While the K-T Boundary can be seen as an analogy of the crisis unfolding as the result of human engagement with Earth, Milankovitch cycles remind us that we should not consider nature and our place within it without also considering the geological and the cosmic.Nigel Clark,\u00a0Inhuman Nature: Sociable life on a dynamic planet. London: Sage Publications, 2011.\u00a0Therefore, the actual golden spike only becomes visible when Loweswater fades away, just as only when we discard the now-obsolete Romantic model will we really be able to confront planetary catastrophe. While Milankovitch cycles are smooth and gradational, the meteorite impact is sudden and unexpected. But both of these seem to be excluded from the Romantic image of Loweswater. The picture prompts the question: What happens to our idea of nature when we take into account all of these excluded agents, interconnections, and processes? Now, with the geological brought to the foreground in Loweswater, it is up to the observer to take up the challenge of working out what that means for human\u2012nature relations.",

Yet, this spot in the North is a powerful tool in politics, economy, scientific exploration, and the war of the Anthropocene.

With climate change and the melting of Arctic ice, that status is questioned by five states with sea borders in the Arctic: Canada, Denmark (with Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Russia, Norway, and the United States (with Alaska). Each shifts its Arctic borders through remapping the continental shelf of the Arctic in order to expand territorial claims. The economic lures of new sea passages, as well as oil and gas resources, tempted the Kingdom of Denmark to go so far as to include the cartographic North Pole in its claim in December 2014 before the United Nations, with arguments based on histories of the past and visions of a sustainable North for human and nonhuman agencies.Ministry of Foreign Affairs et al., Kingdom of Denmark: Strategy for the Arctic 2011\u20132020.

From experiencing unseasonably warm autumnal days on Australia\u2019s east coast I\u2019ve been transported to a cool spring in eastern Germany where the daytime highs are half the nighttime lows where I\u2019ve come from. Just before dawn the air temperature is a little above freezing, and I\u2019m now wearing all the clothes I\u2019m traveling with, standing on an old airfield just south of central Berlin. The sun has not long risen and its rays are only just beginning to find their way over the tops of buildings and trees. Huddling with others, also gathered here on the field, we intuitively position ourselves in patches of growing sunlight, warming ourselves from the early morning chill. I\u2019ve come to Berlin to be a part of an extended workshop bringing together some 120 or more scholars, researchers, and artists interested in issues that the Anthropocene concept exposes. This is the second \u201ccampus\u201d that the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (House of World Cultures) in Berlin has organized, with this one focused on investigating the idea of the \u201cTechnosphere.\u201d As part of a workshop we have been invited here, to Tempelhofer Feld, an airfield used until only recently and now a recreational reserve, to participate in the launching of some artistic sculptures by Berlin-based artist Tom\u00e1s Saraceno. Saraceno\u2019s work grapples with anthropocenic issues and today we will have first-hand experience with some of this work\u2014large sun-powered lighter-than-air membranes\u2014what he terms aerosolar sculptures. Put more simply, these are large balloons fuelled only by the warmth of the sun, which, warming the internal air of the structures, has the potential to power them indefinitely. This removes the device from the grip of petrochemical power\u2014both physically and politically. And for Saraceno these sculptures\u2014indeed, the wider aerosolar project\u2014provoke a rethinking of our engagement with energy, elemental forces, space, and each other.",

Indeed, by taking the simple idea out into the world\u2014into communities\u2014and inviting people to engage with the making process (the materials required are in their basic form plastic bags, sticking tape, and sunshine), the project engages people with the concept in more everyday ways. And at the same time\u2014in its simplicity\u2014it is an iteration of the sociality it calls attention to: a networked, social, and ultimately less hierarchical model that might operate both spatially and politically. At its core, the project is one of reimagining: reimagining how we might do things differently in light of the intractable problems we face at the seeming culmination of the modern project. In anthropocenic terms, if we consider the technosphere to be the assemblage of material and immaterial technologies that envelop the surface of the planet, this project inserts a wedge into this to open up other ways of configuring technology and, as a result, our relationships with other entities\u2014both human and other.",

Working with these simple and abundant elements\u2014air and sunlight\u2014calls for a close attentiveness to conditions. The weather, of course, is a key determinant. Having sunlight is necessarily determined by the presence\u2014or absence\u2014of clouds. The amount of wind also impacts on the viability of the launch\u2014as well as determining trajectories of travel; and the reason for the dawn scheduling is because this time of day often best provides still atmospheric conditions. Indeed, we have been blessed with a clear and still morning for this launch. The impact of such attentiveness has two particular outcomes. Firstly, it is an ongoing attunement to elemental conditions; and enhanced awareness of environmental conditions\u2014weather in relation to season, also geography, but also an understanding of how different elemental conditions impact on the activity. What comes with this reliance on environmental conditions is the requirement for patience and timing. One has to wait for the right conditions; there is no guarantee that they will occur when you want them\u2014and, indeed, no way to induce them. They require you to wait, to have an understanding that your own desire to act must yield to agencies beyond human control. In a sense, you must learn to be humble, to relinquish the ability to control. And, as we wait in the warming sun there is a bustling of activity on this now disused runway. The conditions have been deemed suitable for launch, and two nylon membranes are unpacked and the process of inflating these takes place. The procedure for filling these with air appears to be\u2014rather simply\u2014trailing them behind someone running. If nothing else, it is effective. Once inflated, these structures have the appearance of gigantic otherworldly creatures. They sit, after their initial expansion, grounded. As the surrounding air begins to warm, it gently stirs these creatures, making them seem somehow alive. And over the next hour I\u2019m interested to watch the amount of attention these gentle structures require in being nursed to life. They are well attended\u2014inspected and adjusted\u2014as they prepare for activity. The process is highly tactile. There is much touching, stroking, prodding, and adjusting, and I assume the provision of feedback on things like temperature and pressure. This technology, with its relationship to elemental forces and its sensitivity to conditions, calls for a nurturing disposition, and a continued attentiveness to conditions as they change.",

One has to be able to let go thoughts of expectation, to be patient, to let go of a certain human desire to control. Critical Anthropocene scholarship points to fundamental flaws in modernist thinking, and suggests this needs serious rethinking. Simply, we need new and different models for understanding and engaging with the world\u2014quite differently, and less on our own terms. The Aerocene project makes some wild suggestions: aerosolar travel, aerosolar communities, aerosolar space exploration. These are best not taken as practical proposals. Rather, I read them as design fictions: imaginative proposals which aid us in thinking more wildly about future possibilities. What makes these proposals slightly more intriguing is that the technology they employ is actually simple, practical, and real\u2014it\u2019s not based on some yet-to-be-invented configuration. But, rather than seeing these as end points, the real point is in experimenting with the ideas that these technologies and ideas open up. For example, there has been a recent collaboration with the Red Cross/Red Crescent which is exploring the use of aersolar technology to launch camera payloads to map disaster-affected areas. My designer mind appreciates seeing artistic ideas taken into the world and finding distinctly practical application. At its heart the Aerocene project shows that simple ideas have the potential to have large impacts, and these can be driven by different kinds of sensibilities than those we are used to. In the same vein, it avoids the trap of trying to offer solutions. Rather, its proposals open up possibilities and stimuli for novel thinking about how it might well be applied. In the context of considering the implications of the Anthropocene and navigating new and different pathways through this, the provocations of the aerocene help spur us to consider the possibilities provided by the potential of the very air around us.",

The Adivasi (indigenous communities) have played a significant role in managing/conserving natural resources sustainably for hundreds of years. Their culture, symbols, and ritualistic practices have emerged over centuries as part of their belief in the integration and nurturing of all living beings and the cyclical processes of nature. According to the Adivasi: \u201cif humans do not cooperate and respect the environment and their relationship with the soil their existence will be in danger [\u2026]\u201d; I see this as a process of communication and listening, being mobile with the possibilities of exposing oneself and exploring all the way around \u2026 a continual (self)-transformation \u2026 I associate my experience in Chhattisgarh with the \u201cAnthropocene.\u201d My being there has sensitized me to tacit knowledge. Oral cultures, encouraging the participatory life of the senses, are linked to the concept of the relationship between the human and the nonhuman world and its potential to create experiences at both conscious and subconscious levels. My concern, as an artist, observer, and researcher working with a feminist consciousness, has been to learn in what ways social intervention opens up social spaces and encourages ways which sustain dialogue and discourses, and to understand different knowledge systems in order to produce knowledge and to share knowledge \u2026 I am interested in the issues of eco-feminist praxis such as cross-cultural sharing and eco-feminist philosophy, which stresses notions of care and relationships with all life, as the neglected law pertaining to these areas, both in the southern and in the northern central part of India, is causing the destruction of forests, soil, and rivers. The agenda\u2019s single-minded focus is on faster growth through human-driven/anthropogenic environmental interruptions, where the intersection of regional and national politics is entangled with the imperatives of development and the power of national and global capital. These mineral-rich, heavily forested areas in Chhattisgarh have large indigenous populations whose existence and livelihoods link closely with the forest. The discovery of minerals in the region has led to questions about the legality of their exploitation by state and non-state actors \u2026 The process of land acquisition by private/national and multinational industries for mining and power plants ignores the existence, identity, and knowledge systems of the Adivasi and the laws pertaining to these areas to prevent the kind of destruction and injustice that have followed. Such development projects have led ultimately to the undesired displacement of local habitants \u2026     Local people are encouraged to believe that the radical acceleration in the flows of capital has brought this remote corner of the world under a common umbrella of the global village that signifies the growing of global interconnectedness, whereas in fact the delusion of rapid economic growth has increased conflict and resentment within and among local communities. The hazardous damage to the natural environment is endangering the history, cultural heritage, and creative spirit as well as the perception of culture locally, in which both sensorial experience and philosophical reflection have been part of their being. Here I quote some of the people with whom I have been engaged in these mining areas: \u201cMining may be an economic development for industry but not for our soil and soul.\u201d The local people think it is the end of \u201clife,\u201d as their relationship to the land, as I mentioned above, centers around a belief in nature\u2019s cyclical processes. The \u201crule of law\u201d has remained weak even though indigenous culture and land-holding patterns have been disrupted over the years. These days land assessments are carried out on the basis of development and enterprise to increase GDP. It is difficult to understand, within the commonly accepted Western notions of ownership or property, the Adivasi\u2019s relationship to land, forest, animals, and water as it is rooted in very different conceptual frameworks. They have associations with nature that explain how the natural world offers an insight into the maintenance of being. Belief in both interconnectedness and interdependence has been part of the wisdom of these peoples for centuries, transmitted orally across generations. I would like to share my experience of discovering a dance performance, Kokerenge (cock-like walk), performed by the Muria Gond community in the Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh in 1998, which for me produced unforgettable moments of sensorial intimacy and reciprocity with more than the human terrain. This is both a ritual and an artistic expression, with an emphasis on costumes, makeup, and accessories, but not performed for an audience as such. My research on the Kokerenge in Bastar\u2014whereby after the annual harvest performers travel from village to village to pay tribute to the Lingopen (head of all deities), who symbolizes the entire Earth\u2014has further stimulated my belief in how the arts could enhance the coming together of the senses and how the body and mind interact and collaborate. It is from such experiences that I have come to understand that \u201cartistic and creative productions are expressions opening oneself to a range of visionary experiences in a culture, where the aesthetic experience is not only an individual but also a cultural phenomenon.\u201dJohn Dewey,\u00a0Art as Experience. New York: Perigee Trade, 1959, p. 24. In the\u00a0Kokerenge, the participants gradually form a circle by coordinating the sound of the bells attached to leather belts that each performer wears. That moment of coordination is a poetic experience. The circle is a common form in many indigenous cultures and signifies transformation, movement, and continuity. It is a way of understanding and expressing interconnectedness.     The\u00a0Kokerenge in its cultural context reminds me of John Dewey\u2019s insistence on \u201cartistic expressions as articulating the significance of life for a certain culture [\u2026] a manifestation, and celebration of the life [\u2026] [a] means of promoting its development, the ultimate, their judgment upon the quality of a civilization and what a society considers as a meaningful and satisfying life.\u201dibid., p.36 I have witnessed how communities are forced to lose touch with the Earth, their senses; how the\u00a0Kokerenge performance, which takes place between midnight and dawn, is being relegated by the local authorities and the state police because of a fear of (anticipated) violence caused by forces from the extreme left. It is difficult to watch the process of destruction among cultures that have developed aesthetics or expressions based on their experiential knowledge, the functioning of social systems, and recognition of the significance of interrelatedness. The complexity of interdependencies has stimulated my interest in ecological aesthetics: the aesthetics of integration on the one hand and the probing into the historical roots of the culture of unsustainability on the other. My interest lies in understanding the anthropogenic environmental degradation of the planet that is leading to a culture of unsustainability. I do this by engaging with people as they confront conflict; and through artistic expressions, such as that described, one tries to understand the broader issues. It makes sense to me more than ever now to try to understand the significance of ecological perceptions of indigenous ways of life in different parts of the world and to look at how this wisdom has played a part in sustaining natural resources for thousands of years. How and why that wisdom has not been integrated into modern science and how the need to respect and practice the basic laws of planet Earth are now sensed by science, to protect its existence. Science informs us that the Earth transmits continuous sound frequencies but, unlike animals, we do not hear them \u2026",

These four case studies present research that finds ways of moving between these spaces and the lines that connect them. As is evident in discussions on climate policy and other matters, scientific knowledge is increasingly mismatched with actions upon global issues. As part of The Shape of a Practice, data analyst St\u00e9phane Grumbach and biologist Olivier Hamant took this problem to task by delving into the concept of \u201csuboptimality\u201d in ecological, academic, and political systems to sketch out how better models and better responses to climate issues can become possible at a system scale. Moving between Germany and Panama, Estudio Nuboso attempts to connect scientific and artistic discourses around ecology between the two places while confronting the challenges presented with working in two radically different contexts. The Mont P\u00e8lerin Rewrite is a performative and collective effort to imagine a different world, and a different future, through the creative re-writing and re-interpreting of central economic policy documents written nearly 70 years ago in Switzerland that encode neoliberal ideologies in the present. The Living Room is an ongoing experiment using living rooms as a space for self representation; a space which has the potential to subvert the role of guest and host and give a different socio-political meaning to the act of hospitality as it concerns the experience of refugees in Europe.",

As organizers of Anthropocene Drift, we believed it was necessary to acknowledge that we were gathering on Indigenous land. On Ho-Chunk land. However, we chose not to begin our program, Over the Levee, Under the Plow, with a formal land acknowledgment. Rather, we viewed the five-day seminar\u2014itself building on eighteen months of focused research and planning\u2014as a prolonged land acknowledgment, and also a concerted attempt to move beyond acknowledgment. That is to say, we need to move from words to actions as we grapple with what it means to live and work as settlers on Indigenous land. On Ho-Chunk land, in this case. Land acknowledgments are necessary but insufficient gestures of accountability to Indigenous peoples in the colonial present. Chelsea Vowel, a M\u00e9tis writer and teacher from manitow-s\u00e2kahikan (Lac Ste. Anne) in Alberta, Canada, invites us \u201cto start imagining a constellation of relationships that must be entered into beyond territorial acknowledgments.\u201dChelsea Vowel, \u201cBeyond Territorial Acknowledgments,\u201d \u00e2pihtawikosis\u00e2n (blog), Sep 23, 2016: http://apihtawikosisan.com/2016/09/beyond-territorial-acknowledgments/ She encourages settlers to \u201cstart learning about [their] obligations as a guest in this territory.\u201d One of the very first obligations as a guest is to know the names of your hosts, and to listen closely to them. In the case of our seminar, doing so elevated homelands and places of belonging instead of field stations, a perspectival shift suggested by Ojibwe artist Andrea Carlson.Andrea Carlson, \u201cThe Mississippi River Is the Opposite of the Anthropocene,\u201d Anthropocene Curriculum (blog), Feb 10, 2020: https://www.anthropocene-curriculum.org/contribution/the-mississippi-river-is-the-opposite-of-the-anthropocene \u201cMoving beyond territorial acknowledgments,\u201d Vowell continues, \u201cmeans asking hard questions about what needs to be done once we\u2019re \u2018aware of Indigenous presence.\u2019 It requires that we remain uncomfortable, and it means making concrete, disruptive change.\u201d Acknowledgment is therefore not an end itself but a provocation to disrupt, to \u201cunsettle\u201d\u2014figuratively and literally\u2014our relationships to the land, to history, and to one another. As three white settlers, artists, and academics, we welcomed participants to lands that are not rightfully ours and spoke with voices authorized and amplified by white supremacy. Ours is the white, middle-class subjectivity\u2014already a complicated assemblage of varying identities\u2014that the anthropologist Heather Anne Swanson describes as \u201cpredicated on not noticing. [\u2026] on structural blindness: on a refusal to acknowledge the histories we inherit.\u201dHeather Anne Swanson, \u201cThe Banality of the Anthropocene,\u201d Member Voices, Fieldsights, Feb 22, 2017: https://culanth.org/fieldsights/1074-the-banality-of-the-anthropocene So we began Over the Levee, Under the Plow by unsettling the very land on which we gathered\u2014acknowledging our complicity in the violence that secured our place there. Here and Now Anthropocene Drift began in a place usually marked as an ending. Not far from where we gathered in Blackhawk Park, a massacre took place. On the first and second days of August 1832, the US Army and Illinois militia fired on a group of starving, exhausted Native Americans\u2014mostly Sauk and Meskwaki, but also Kickapoo, Ho-Chunk, and Potawatomi\u2014as they tried to cross the Mississippi River to safety. Their leader, Black Hawk, had already tried to surrender several times during the so-called war that bears his name, and the massacre began even after he once again waved a flag of truce. When soldiers began firing, Black Hawk\u2019s band had little choice but to provide cover for those trying to cross. Soldiers on the bluffs streamed down to shoot at closer range, while a military riverboat fired on retreating families with cannons. Although some made it to safety, many of those who crossed the river were soon captured by the US-allied Dakota. Militiamen gleefully mutilated corpses; sharpshooters deliberately targeted babies. When reproached for these actions, one volunteer soldier coldly replied, \u201cKill the nits, and you\u2019ll have no lice.\u201dWilliam Henry Perrin, History of Crawford and Clark Counties, Illinois. Chicago: O. L. Baskin, 1883, p. 232. Officially called the Battle of Bad Axe, the event produced carnage so one-sided that it has been described as a massacre since the 1850s. Of the nearly 2,000 people who had joined Black Hawk in April to contest the terms of a fraudulent treaty and return to their ancestral village of Saukenuk to farm, only thirty-nine survivors were captured at the conclusion of the massacre. Many had died on the journey before reaching the Mississippi, while others no doubt managed to escape during the fighting. Black Hawk surrendered himself to American authorities a few days after the massacre and was imprisoned just down the river in Prairie du Chien.",

A newsletter from the Dane County Historical Society summed it up: \u201cWithout an Indian war threat, Wisconsin Territory was created just four years later and rapid settlement produced statehood in 1848.\u201dDane County Historical Society Newsletter, Summer 2007, p. 2. The genocidal war unleashed a new phase of regional settler colonization and justified an aggressive campaign of removal of the northern Indigenous peoples, including the Ho-Chunk, Meskwaki, Iowa, and Kickapoo Nations. Historian Jeffrey Ostler argues, \u201cAfter the Bad Axe Massacre, federal officials seized the moment to separate Indians from their lands. Whether they had supported Black Hawk, remained neutral, or assisted the United States government made no difference.\u201dJeffrey Ostler, Surviving Genocide: Native Nations and the United States from the American Revolution to Bleeding Kansas. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2019, p. 307. Beginning in 1832, the Ho-Chunk suffered multiple removals\u2014from Wisconsin to Iowa, Minnesota, Dakota Territory, and Nebraska. Of course, some Ho-Chunk refused to be removed, and remained in or returned to each of these places. The Bad Axe Massacre has a prehistory, a context. A land cession treaty had been signed in St. Louis in 1804 by a Sauk delegation that did not expect to enter into land negotiations and lacked the authority to do so, leading many members of the Sauk Nation to regard the treaty as invalid and to resist American attempts to enforce it. This fraudulent treaty and increasing squatter incursions into their traditional territories prompted the Sauk, Meskwaki, Ho-Chunk, and Potawatomi to support the British during the War of 1812. Black Hawk himself fought in that war and incorporated British insignia into his wardrobe for the rest of his life. Under the terms of the Treaty of Ghent of 1814, the US assumed actual, rather than nominal, control over the so-called Northwest Territory, and settlers began arriving en masse. At the conclusion of that war, Saukenuk, the Sauk capital where Over the Levee, Under the Plow ended, was the largest city in what would soon become Illinois. Occupied mostly during the growing season when the Sauk returned from their winter hunting grounds in what is now Iowa, Saukenuk\u2019s log houses were surrounded by vegetable and corn fields. The lead deposits of northwestern Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin were mined seasonally by Ho-Chunk, Sauk, and Meskwaki women. These well-stewarded resources were extremely attractive to settlers, and from the 1820s both Sauk and Meskwaki leaders began to complain of finding white squatters living in their Saukenuk homes, stealing their corn, and mining the ore with people they had enslaved.",

In a cataclysmically short period, the capitalist\u2013colonialist partnership has destroyed our relationships with thousands of species and ecosystems. [\u2026] [\u2026] Settler ancestors wanted today\u2019s world. They would have relished the possibility that some of their descendants could freely commit extractive violence on Indigenous lands and then feel, with no doubts, that they are ethical people.\u201dKyle Powys Whyte, \u201cWhite Allies, Let\u2019s Be Honest about Decolonization,\u201d Yes!, Apr 3, 2018: http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/decolonize/white-allies-lets-be-honest-about-decolonization-20180403 We must acknowledge this environmental fantasy/dystopia, too, and sit with the discomfort acknowledgment arouses. We gathered at Blackhawk Park because of the massacre that took place on August 1 and 2, 1832. But that is obviously not all that has happened there, and those who survived the massacre have relationships to this place that cannot be reduced to a simple narrative of domination and extermination. As George Thurman, a direct descendent of Black Hawk and the former Principal Chief of the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma, explains: To say that Black Hawk still has relevance to the Sac and Fox implies a hold to the past, and that\u2019s true because we are all connected, a part of those who came before and holding on to what they taught us for those yet to come. However, our past is not a fixed point that grows farther away with each new generation; instead, our past is like a bloodline, living, breathing, and growing as we grow. [\u2026] As a descendant, my perspective about Black Hawk is more personal. He is a very real part of what I bring to the Sac and Fox Nation as its chief and who I am as Sac and Fox. I have visited the places where he walked and could place my own footsteps where his had been. I stood on the banks of the Mississippi River at Bad Axe where 179 years ago I would have been a target for the guns and cannon just for being Sauk. So many of our people died there. The massacre still echoes within us. It was a tragic ending. But I, a member of that same tribe, stood there at the place of \u201cending\u201d and saw my people of today make offerings at the riverside. Black Hawk fought so his people could live, and there, where one might think it all ended for us, we stood, remembering our people in the way they left to us and that is uniquely ours.George Thurman, \u201cWe Are Still Here to Tell Their Stories and to Add Our Own,\u201d in Re-Collecting Black Hawk: Landscape, Memory, and Power in the American Midwest, ed. Nicholas Brown and Sarah Kanouse. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2015, pp. 20\u201321. Blackhawk Park can also be understood as a \u201cwounded place,\u201d which geographer Karen Till describes as \u201cpresent to the pain of others and [embodying] difficult social pasts.\u201dKaren Till, \u201cArtistic and Activist Memory-Work: Approaching Place-Based Practice,\u201d Memory Studies, vol. 1, no. 1 (2008): p. 108. In this sense, the confluence of the Bad Axe River with the Mississippi is not unlike Bdote, the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, which has been the focus of Dakota artist Mona Smith\u2019s ongoing healing work.See Mona Smith, \u201cLearning from the Dakota: Water and Place,\u201d Open Rivers, no. 11 (Summer 2018): https://editions.lib.umn.edu/openrivers/article/learning-from-the-dakota-water-and-place/ In places such as these, we must challenge ourselves to understand, following historian Christine DeLucia, \u201chow memories of devastation exist relationally alongside those of regeneration.\u201dChristine M. DeLucia, Memory Lands: King Philip\u2019s War and the Place of Violence in the Northeast. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2018, p. 22. If the Mississippi Valley can be understood, in part, by tracing Indigenous removals and land cessions, it can also be understood in terms of refusals and returns, particularly among the Ho-Chunk and Meskwaki Nations. The effects of removals are felt today and every day, and shape what Lakota historian Nick Estes calls \u201cthe Indigenous political practice of return, restoration, and reclamation of belonging and place.\u201dNick Estes, Our History Is the Future: Standing Rock versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance. New York: Verso, 2019, p. 248. As the ecological devastation initiated by the wounding of places like Bdote and Bad Axe spreads across the planet, how to remember, care for, and address sites of intergenerational and profoundly uneven trauma become ever more urgent questions. Here and Now We began our public program forty-one hours after an equinox; six days into the student-led Global Climate Strike; a few months after the water that covered Blackhawk Park for much of the spring and early summer receded; and at the end of the hottest decade in human history. We all followed different paths to arrive at Blackhawk Park that September afternoon. Some of us drove to the park from South Central Wisconsin and Central Illinois, the middle of the so-called Corn Belt, where rivers with names like the Rock, Vermilion, Platte, Mackinaw, Menominee, Embarras, Wisconsin, Kaskaskia, and Sangamon\u2014along with many drainage ditches and canals\u2014connect, eventually, to the Mississippi River. The dominant plants found in that territory for most of the year\u2014genetically modified yellow dent #2 corn and soybeans\u2014require vast amounts of energy and chemical inputs. When discussing the Anthropocene, this landscape is a seemingly easy case study as a totally transformed ecosystem, as environmental historian William Cronon described years ago in Nature\u2019s Metropolis.William Cronon, Nature\u2019s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West. New York: W. W. Norton, 1991. Shortly after massacres like Bad Axe secured US ownership over the Midwest, the series of Swamp Land Acts passed between 1849 and 1860 \u201cgave\u201d lands considered swamps and wetlands to states so that these ecosystems could be converted into private property and made \u201cproductive.\u201d This federal legislation did not result directly and immediately in what geographers like Michael Urban have argued is, for all intents and purposes, the permanent transformation of the region\u2019s hydrological and ecological composition.Michael Urban, \u201cCatastrophic Human-Induced Change in Stream-Channel Planform and Geometry in an Agricultural Watershed, Illinois, USA,\u201d Annals of the Association of American Geographers, vol. 93, no. 4 (2003). Rather, the policies were only one step that prefigured the work that speculators and farmers would undertake to remake the land in their own image through drainage ditches and subsurface tile drainage systems. The near total elimination of wetlands and grasslands in this region was also a colonial war\u2014this time against what anthropologist James C. Scott has referred to as the ungovernable spaces of wetlands and mud, and, of course, against the lifeways that were sustained by them.James C. Scott, Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998, p. 56. The vast fields of corn and soy that we see today are local instantiations of the colonial and capitalist land use and plantation economies that exist around the world. This model is, in fact, one that has been exported at an enormous scale to Brazil and Argentina. Like all plantation economies, the conceptualization of the land as a storehouse of resources waiting to be extracted also includes the conceptualization of bodies, both human and otherwise, as expendable forms of capital. The effects of this physical transformation are reverberating across the biosphere. A week before the launch of our seminar, the New York Times reported on an article in the journal Science that shows \u201cthe number of birds in the United States and Canada has fallen by 29 percent since 1970. [\u2026] There are 2.9 billion fewer birds taking wing now than there were 50 years ago.\u201dThis summary of the Science article comes from Carl Zimmer, \u201cBirds Are Vanishing from North America,\u201d New York Times, Sep 19, 2019: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/science/bird-populations-america-canada.html. Blackhawk Park lies within the Mississippi Flyway, a vital migration corridor for more than 325 bird species, which pass by there twice a year en route from breeding grounds in Canada and the northern United States to wintering grounds along the Gulf of Mexico and in Central and South America. Two weeks before the launch, the New York Times reported that \u201cthis year\u2019s flooding across the Midwest and the South affected nearly 14 million people.\u201d The article noted: \u201cThe year through May 2019 was the wettest 12-month period on record in the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Edward Clark, director of NOAA\u2019s National Water Center, said, \u2018This is a year that will remain in our cultural memory, in our history.\u2019\u201dSarah Almukhtar, Blacki Migliozzi, John Schwartz, and Josh Williams, \u201cThe Great Flood of 2019: A Complete Picture of a Slow-Motion Disaster,\u201d New York Times, Sep 11, 2019: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/11/us/midwest-flooding.html The year continued to be very wet into fall. The Midwest witnessed\u2014and was unevenly impacted by\u2014historic flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and many of their tributaries. \u201cThe fields are washing away,\u201d Missouri farmer Kate Glastetter told Pacific Standard magazine in June, a month when Blackhawk Park was submerged beneath the swollen Mississippi.Emily Moon, \u201c\u2018The Fields Are Washing Away:\u2019 Midwest Flooding Is Wreaking Havoc on Farmers,\u201d Pacific Standard, Jun 6, 2019: https://psmag.com/environment/the-fields-are-washing-away-midwest-flooding-is-wreaking-havoc-on-farmers The silt left by receding floodwaters added to the layer\u2014already several meters thick in many places\u2014 of what scientists call \u201cpost-settlement alluvium,\u201d or \u201clegacy sediment,\u201d the result of nineteenth-century Euro-American agricultural practices that initiated widespread erosion and washed upland sediment into the region\u2019s valleys. The economic stress posed by the most recent floods may exacerbate the epidemic of depression among American farmers, whose suicide rate in 2018 was already twice that of combat veterans.Debbie Weingarten, \u201cWhy Are America\u2019s Farmers Killing Themselves?,\u201d Guardian, Dec 11, 2018: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/why-are-americas-farmers-killing-themselves-in-record-numbers And although words like \u201cAnthropocene\u201d and \u201cclimate crisis\u201d are controversial or even unknown in many rural communities, it is possible to identify within them what environmental researchers Ashlee Cunsolo and Neville Ellis call ecological grief: \u201cthe grief felt in relation to experienced or anticipated ecological losses, including the loss of species, ecosystems and meaningful landscapes due to acute or chronic environmental change.\u201dAshlee Cunsolo and Neville R. Ellis, \u201cEcological Grief as a Mental Health Response to Climate Change-Related Loss,\u201d Nature Climate Change, vol. 8, no. 4 (2018): p. 275. Mourning Nature in the (Colonial) Anthropocene Seventy-two years and forty miles from where we gathered at Blackhawk Park, ecologist Aldo Leopold dedicated a monument to the last Wisconsin passenger pigeon, which was shot dead in September 1899. In his speech at the unveiling, Leopold reflected: \u201cWe have erected a monument to commemorate the funeral of a species. It symbolizes our sorrow. We grieve because no living man will see again the onrushing phalanx of victorious birds, sweeping a path for spring across the March skies, chasing the defeated winter from all the woods and prairies of Wisconsin.\u201d In dedicating what was perhaps the first monument to extinction, Leopold called out the actions of previous generations\u2014\u201cOur grandfathers,\u201d he declared, \u201c[believed it was] more important to multiply people and comforts than to cherish the beauty of the land in which they live\u201d\u2014while also reserving his greatest grief not for the birds themselves but for the loss of cultural and aesthetic relationships that mainstream settler American culture had developed with that species.Aldo Leopold, quoted in Kelly Enright, \u201cExhibiting Extinction: Martha and the Monument, Two Modes of Remembering Nature,\u201d Cultural Studies Review, vol. 25, no. 1 (2019): pp. 151\u201371.",

Only you know if we did it.\u201d Leopold\u2019s pigeon plaque is more explicit in its accusation: \u201cThis species became extinct through the avarice of and thoughtlessness of man.\u201dEmphases added to both quotations. These monuments are significant because they point to an ongoing shift toward considering longer, multigenerational timespans and finding \u201cnature\u201d and cultural relationships with the natural world grievable. Yet in invoking an undifferentiated \u201cwe,\u201d they risk reinforcing the already widespread narrative\u2014epitomized in Leopold\u2019s plaque\u2014that humanity writ large is responsible for these losses. However, as Kyle Powys Whyte reminds us, some humans have long benefited from the very forces that generated the losses that we now grieve or find \u201courselves\u201d suddenly vulnerable to. The very real grief that climate change can and should engender\u2014and that creative projects are uniquely suited to hold space for\u2014risks becoming an eco-variant of what Renato Rosaldo called \u201cimperialist nostalgia [which] uses a pose of \u2018innocent yearning\u2019 both to capture people&#8217;s imaginations and to conceal its complicity with often brutal domination.\u201dRenato Rosaldo, \u201cImperialist Nostalgia,\u201d Representations, no. 26 (1989): p. 108. Those of us who have inherited the structural blindness endemic to white, middle-class American culture must insistently recognize the staggering ecological costs already born by Indigenous peoples long before the last passenger pigeon fell from the sky. The Colonial Anthropocene In starting our seminar at Blackhawk Park on September 25, 2019, we were making two implicit propositions. The first is that what has been called the Anthropocene\u2014the intensification and industrialization of land and resource use that has led us to the brink of ecological collapse\u2014is not the inevitable product of humanity writ large but rather the consequence of Euro-American colonialism and the capitalist economic systems it built. Anthropocene Drift (Field Station 2) tried to make visible not just the Anthropocene but also the colonial Anthropocene, which is to say it sought to reveal how ongoing processes of colonization are transforming the Earth. The (colonial) Anthropocene is everywhere, of course, but it is particularly palpable in places like Blackhawk Park, Indian Lake, and the former site of the Badger Army Ammunition Plant in Wisconsin, where our field station programming took place. Our second proposition is that the Anthropocene is an uneven spatial phenomenon. Debates about the start of the Anthropocene are usually framed in temporal rather than spatial terms. When did it begin, we ask, not where did it start? Dates are singular rather than plural. The Anthropocene started in either 1492, 1610, 1619, or 1950. It didn\u2019t start in all these, plus a million other times and places. We contend that the Anthropocene is both a world geo-historical event and a highly variegated and textured condition that is experienced unevenly and very specifically across space, species, gender, race, and class. Anthropocene Drift asked not when did the (colonial) Anthropocene begin, but, instead, where is it most visible? And where, how, and by whom is it felt most intensely? Part of our interest in the Driftless Area was thus pragmatic, insofar as it ties the Anthropocene to colonialism in place(s). It\u2019s ironic to think about the Anthropocene in terms of temporal golden spikes. Spikes are, after all, driven into space, not time. They are staples connecting one thing with another, an attempt to bridge a gap. According to historian Manu Karuka, that other famous golden spike\u2014the one that connected the First Transcontinental Railroad\u2014\u201cdid not suture the Union after the Civil War; it symbolically finalized the industrial infrastructure of a continental empire where none had existed before.\u201dManu Karuka, Empire\u2019s Tracks: Indigenous Nations, Chinese Workers, and the Transcontinental Railroad. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2019, p. xiv. But if you wanted to place a spatiotemporal golden spike to mark the start of the Anthropocene in the Upper Midwest (or, as it was known from 1787 to 1803, the Northwest Territory), the confluence of the Bad Axe and Mississippi Rivers\u2014that is to say, Blackhawk Park\u2014would be an ideal location. Yet framing the \u201cquotidian Anthropocene\u201d as starting here risks reducing this place to the Bad Axe Massacre and reinforcing what literary scholar Mark Rifkin calls \u201csettler time,\u201d a temporality that consigns Indigenous people to the past while selectively admitting them to a present defined entirely in settler terms. Only within settler time could the Black Hawk conflict be described as the \u201clast Indian war east of the Mississippi.\u201d This designation is another instance of the \u201cphenomenon of lasting,\u201d which Ojibwe historian Jean O\u2019Brien identifies as a \u201crhetorical strategy that asserts as a fact the claim that Indians can never be modern.\u201dJean O\u2019Brien, Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians Out of Existence in New England. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2010, p. 107. The Black Hawk War was obviously not the \u201clast Indian war,\u201d nor was it the last conflict over settlement or sovereignty in the Midwest\u2014or anywhere else. It wasn\u2019t even the last Black Hawk war. The longest and most destructive conflict between so-called pioneer immigrants and Native Americans in Utah history, which occurred thirty-three years after the conflict in Illinois, is also commonly referred to as the Black Hawk War. Similarly, calling the Anthropocene a new geologic time that \u201cwe\u201d are all in only makes sense in the framework of settler time. If we adopt the Anthropocene as a useful analytic framework, we must take care that it not become a totalizing, teleological narrative, an extension of Rifkin\u2019s \u201csettler time\u201d to which Indigenous people might be admitted, but only on terms that ultimately undermine the heterogeneous temporalities that are forms of sovereignty existing beyond settler recognition.Mark Rifkin, Beyond Settler Time: Temporal Sovereignty and Indigenous Self-Determination. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2017. For this reason, our Field Station largely did not engage the Anthropocene as a definitional project, whether by establishing its temporality or locating exemplary anthropocenic phenomena. We were most interested in how the Anthropocene is to be survivable and, crucially, for whom. We must remember that the colonial project that undergirds the Anthropocene was never fully successful: there still exist biocultural and temporal \u201crefuges,\u201d sustained by the descendants of the people colonization failed to exterminate. Anthropocene Drift (Field Station 2) was a protracted effort to learn about what novelist and essayist Gerald Vizenor calls \u201csurvivance\u201d (\u201csurvival\u201d plus \u201cresistance\u201d) in the face of extended, violent ecosocial trauma.Gerald Vizenor, Manifest Manners: Narratives on Postindian Survivance. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1999. While we sought to listen to and learn from Indigenous people, we do not hold up Indigenous \u201cresilience\u201d as a model for settler society, such that the refusal to be eliminated becomes yet another resource for Euro-Americans to plunder. Rather, we sought to strengthen relationships with and between Indigenous individuals and groups and among settler descendants, out of which we aimed to build practices of survivability that foreground both difference and justice in the (colonial) Anthropocene. Clint Carroll, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, and the seminar\u2019s concluding speaker, describes this as \u201crelational activism,\u201d explaining: For Indigenous peoples, the political is environmental\u2014our struggles are most fundamentally about and for the land. This is not a liberal stance, not an environmentalist stance, not a Marxist class-struggle stance. It is an Indigenous stance that may touch on points within the above positions yet offers the world something distinct, something fundamentally different that seeks to benefit all those who have a right to life, that is, all things living\u2014and this includes plants, animals, landforms, waterways, and the many other beings with which humans must maintain respectful relations.Clint Carroll, \u201cRelational Activism and Indigenous Futures,\u201d World Literature Today, Oct 10, 2019: https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/blog/cultural-cross-sections/relational-activism-and-indigenous-futures-clint-carroll Recognizing fundamental differences between Indigenous and progressive Euro-American political traditions is essential for any meaningful exchange. In the especially fraught context of settler\u2013Indigenous contact\u2014which has long mixed violent conquest with romanticized celebration, and forced assimilation with cultural appropriation\u2014we must treat concepts of \u201creconciliation\u201d and \u201cunderstanding\u201d with caution, lest they become yet another settler \u201cmove to innocence.\u201dEve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang, \u201cDecolonization Is Not a Metaphor,\u201d Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education &amp; Society, vol. 1, no. 1 (2012): pp. 1\u201340. Rather, by highlighting both what is relational and what is incommensurable, we hope to live a better, more responsive, and inescapably Earth-bound life in place, whether Indigenous, settler, \u201carrivant,\u201d or all three.Literary scholar Jodi Byrd disrupts the Indigenous/settler binary by inserting a third category of arrivant. Borrowed from the African Caribbean poet Kamau Brathwaite, the term \u201carrivant\u201d describes \u201cthose people forced into the Americas through the violence of European and Anglo-American colonialism and imperialism around the globe.\u201d See Jodi A. Byrd, The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011, p. xix. Grounded Relationalities In the Vermilion River watershed near the border of Illinois and Indiana, there has been something of a successful campaign against the unregulated impacts of waste from coal-burning power plants, which of course are always located alongside rivers. A coalition of urban and rural organizations\u2014including the Prairie Rivers Network, Faith in Place, Eco-Justice Collaborative, and Earthjustice\u2014mobilized a large, politically diverse population to pressure the Illinois government to force power companies to deal with the problems posed by mountains of coal ash. At one Illinois Environmental Protection Agency hearing, residents packed a gym at Danville Area Community College to argue that the river needs to be understood as a living thing that cannot be legislated or controlled by engineering solutions. These residents represented the largely white, rural, working-class population that voted for Donald Trump in 2016, and we have no illusions that they\u2014whether individually liberal or conservative\u2014were representing anything other than their own interests, in the form of maintaining their property claims and protecting the health of their families and friends. But we could also choose to hear at least some recognition of what one of our participants, the historian Alyosha Goldstein (along with his coauthors Jodi Byrd, Jodi Melamed, and Chandan Reddy) has called \u201cgrounded relationalities\u201d: \u201cIf the grounded relationalities of Indigenous philosophies might tell us anything, then, they remind us that knowledge must always remain grounded as the land calls to us and for us to find our place within the ongoing acts of interconnectivity that surround us.\u201dJodi A. Byrd, Alyosha Goldstein, Jodi Melamed, and Chandan Reddy, \u201cPredatory Value: Economies of Dispossession and Disturbed Relationalities,\u201d Social Text, vol. 36, no. 2 (2018): 11\u201314. How might the experience of these testifying Illinois residents, as settlers in the (colonial) Anthropocene, be mobilized toward living within it differently? Goldstein and his coauthors ask for a consideration of how land, \u201cunderstood not as property or territory but as a source of relation with an agency of its own,\u201d might make other possibilities available, possibilities that recognize the racialized and embodied histories that we have inherited and continue to create. Although our Field Station research and public program centered Indigenous voices, the opening of the seminar did not include the visible participation of Native Americans in the spiritually, historically, and ecologically charged site of the Bad Axe Massacre. Early in our planning, we spent several weeks asking individuals we know in the Sauk, Meskwaki, Ho-Chunk, and Kickapoo Nations about the value of meeting there to address this history. Several of these people joined us for portions of the seminar but did not respond to or declined the invitation to meet us at Bad Axe. Bill Quackenbush, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer for the Ho-Chunk Nation, who led a four-hour tour with the group on the seminar\u2019s second day, explained his reluctance: \u201cOur internal perspectives, stories, and histories of this and many other traumatic events are only intended to stay within our tribal communities.\u201d Quackenbush helped us understand that an invitation to perform or narrate at this site of trauma is inappropriate. It is only within settler time that this \u201chistory\u201d needs to be specifically addressed as such, since it is being actively lived in Indigenous communities every day. If the (colonial) Anthropocene is to be survivable, Indigenous people and settlers will have different roles. As Dakota medicine gardener Francis Bettelyoun explains in artist Corinne Teed\u2019s booklet for the Field Station: \u201cWe [the Dakota people] are Indigenizing. We are not decolonizing. Your work is decolonizing.\u201dCorinne Teed, with Francis Bettelyoun, Rhonda Funmaker, and Jodee Smith), Amongst Relatives, Field Guides to the Anthropocene Drift. Berlin: Haus der Kulturen der Welt; Munich: Goethe-Institut, 2019, https://regionalrelationships.org/anthrodrift/bookletPDFs/AmongstRelatives.pdf. Anthropocene Drift (Field Station 2) was our humble contribution to that ongoing work. As we assemble these reflections a few months after the conclusion of the seminar, we continue to be mindful of the here and now, and how shifting places and times assert themselves and inflect our understandings of the (colonial) Anthropocene. The end of the year\u2014the end of the decade\u2014witnessed another UN Climate Change Conference (COP25), and teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg is in the news again. This time it is not because of what she said, but because of what she didn\u2019t say, and how she used her platform to center other voices, especially Indigenous voices. \u201cOur stories have been told over and over again,\u201d Thunberg said to delegates at COP25. \u201cThere is no need to listen to us anymore.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt is people especially from the global south, especially from Indigenous communities, who need to tell their stories.\u201dAssociated Press, \u201cGreta Asks Media to Focus on Other Young Climate Activists,\u201d Voice of America, Dec 9, 2019): https://www.voanews.com/europe/greta-asks-media-focus-other-young-climate-activists. In response to Thunberg\u2019s action, Hartman Deetz, an environmental activist and member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, wrote on Facebook: \u201csee\u2026 I like Greta. She gets it, what privilege is and how to use it. Create a platform and give it to the people who need it. Thank you Greta.\u201d Hartman Deetz, \u201csee&#8230; I like Greta,\u201d Facebook, Dec 14, 2019, https://www.facebook.com/hartman.deetz/posts/10156754200397267",

Let your imagination run free: your segment might be real or imaginary, abstract or specific, past or present or future. It could be the border between two countries, a medieval fortification, a ruined wall in the woods outside your childhood home. The only criterion here is that it should interest you. This segment is going to be your contribution to the fence your group is constructing. You\u2019re going to draw it and connect it to the other segments, so they form a chain. First, however, you\u2019ll want to think about the stories you want your segment to tell. Who built it, and why? What is its purpose? What does it do? Does it keep someone or something out? Or in? What does it divide, and why? Why was it important to build it, and to whom? What does it allow people to do\u2014or stop them from doing? What problems does it solve\u2014or create? Will it exist in a thousand years? Will people remember it? Will they destroy it? What interests you about this fence? Why do you think it\u2019s important? Once you\u2019ve decided what to say with your segment of the fence, you should draw it\u2014perhaps on a sheet of paper\u2014in such a way that it can connect to the others. Use whatever means you\u2019re comfortable with. You might use words, drawing or paint, dates, word balloons, shapes cut out from paper. You can draw on memories or facts, quotes or statistics. Once the segments are connected, step back and admire your handiwork. If you want, you can each take turns explaining your own segment\u2014why you chose it, what it means to you, why you think it\u2019s important\u2014and commenting on the others.

Choose a fence you encounter in your daily life and list at least five of the implications you think it has (for you, for other humans, for animals, as a cultural tool, as a material entity\u2026) Before building a fence, what it is that you want to fence (keep in/keep out)? In relation to what you want to keep in/out, decide on the materials you need to use: how resistant/impenetrable/permeable/sharp/soft\u2026 do you wish your fence to be? Sit and think (preferably before constructing the fence!) about the consequences your fence will have. Do you still want to build the fence? If yes, arrange your materials and set up the fence.",

                "text": "The photo is of an object, a sculpture titled\u00a0Cadillac Ranch, created by a group of young architects/artists named Ant Farm. I was a member of the group and supervised the installation in June 1974. The photo was taken at a party to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of\u00a0Cadillac Ranch. It is late afternoon on June 21, 2004, the Summer Solstice. It is a social gathering reflecting Anthropos\u2019 desire to commemorate and mark time passing. Twelve Anthropos can be seen in the photo. The location is a wheat field just west of Amarillo, Texas, alongside Interstate 40, but set back 150 meters from the highway. The site could be the geographic center of the North American continent: latitude 35.18724, longitude 101.9869. The nonhuman is represented by the ten cars which have been stripped of their functional mobility and transformed into art objects, frozen in place, inserted into the ground, and lined up as an evolutionary diagram\u2014the rise and fall of the tail fin, 1948\u201364. The automobile, an \u201cextension of man\u201d as Marshal McLuhan said, perhaps has been the most powerful shaping force in transforming the surface of the planet during the twentieth century, at least on this continent. The Cadillac was the top of the General Motors product line and considered \u201cthe Standard of the World\u201d during the 1950s. The 1959 Cadillac sports the largest tail fins, possibly representing a pinnacle of the automotive bell curve. Several \u201cTimes\u2014Before and After\u201d are represented here: times before and after the tail fin; the time before the peak of the automotive bell curve, which stretches back to the late nineteenth century, and the time after, an unknown future of changing technologies of mobility; the time before and after the transition of photography to a digital medium. The vertical line in the photo marks it as an artifact of pre-digital photography, because this panoramic view was made by combining two drugstore prints. The line also divides the 1956 Cadillac and the 1957. Two additional cars are not visible to the left. Dark clouds on the horizon portend severe weather, and, in fact, the party ended when rain, along with hail the size of tennis balls, fell from the sky.",

                "text": "Mississippi. An Anthropocene River was a continental-scale experiment in distributed perception. All the participants began at a particular place, somewhere with water in a territory. As artists and researchers, we tried to open up the expressivity of those places. You could travel to the different field stations, and there was also a river journey. Claire Pentecost and I would go to Lake Itasca and paddle the Headwaters, and then after our own field station was complete we would rejoin the river travelers at the confluence of the Ohio and the Mississippi, get in the long voyageur canoes, and follow the currents to a town called New Madrid. Everyone who possibly could was going to meet again at the Human Delta event in New Orleans\u2014or somewhere else downstream. Floating over all this was the idea, or the dream, that we could take one of the central concepts of Earth systems science, the hydrological cycle, and turn it into something subjective, intimate, and shareable within particular communities. The thing that inspired me most were the swamps, and a scientific paper called \u201cThe Flood-Pulse Concept in River-Floodplain Systems.\u201dWolfgang J. Junk, Peter B. Bayley, and Richard E. Sparks, \u201cThe Flood Pulse Concept in River-Floodplain Systems,\u201d Canadian Special Publication of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 106, no. 1 (1989): pp. 110\u201327. Here\u2019s the idea: a river is not a linear continuum stretching from source to sea. Instead it\u2019s a fluctuating \u201caquatic/terrestrial transition zone.\u201d Its ecological significance lies not within its established channel, but in its capacity to overflow its banks according to a seasonal pulse determined by snowmelt, rainfall, and the intrinsic conditions of the floodplain itself. The authors speak of a \u201cmoving littoral\u201d or mobile shoreline, offering the image of a dynamic process that does not disrupt, but rather, defines the river. This concept is beautiful to the mind and verifiable with the eye\u2014but you\u2019ll see that the moving littoral immediately runs into walls constructed by human beings. Moving between the temporal variability of the flood and the vast, frozen system of engineered levees and dams that attempts to contain it, a group of us tried to touch the pulse of the Anthropocene River. At our field station, called Confluence Ecologies, we held an exhibition devoted to the theme. The hope was that traveling by canoe would provide, not only a vantage from which to observe these dynamic relations, but also a context in which to discuss them. So what happened? As often, the experience was full of unexpected events, and at times overwhelming. As the entire program reached its close I realized there was something involved that I hadn\u2019t understood. What\u2019s more, this was the fundamental thing, the core idea of the Anthropocene. Nature itself is political, not by definition or essence, but because it is everywhere infused with the consequences of power relations between human beings. For sure, all of our field station groups discussed such power relations constantly, in conversations that ranged from Black and Indigenous histories to the legacy of synthetic nitrogen or nuclear weapons. The difficulty for me was connecting the conversations to the contours of the territory, which are both cultural and psychic. There are forms of unconscious resistance that are transpersonal, and that act to maintain the paralyzed structures of Anthropocene society. These resistances not only block one\u2019s perception: they block us from really living. They leave us incapable of responding to the tragedy of global ecological destruction. This difficulty is something I want to share in retrospect. I kept thinking back to the refrain of a famous 1959 avant-garde film by Alain Resnais: \u201cYou saw nothing in Hiroshima.\u201dHiroshima, mon amour, feature film, directed by Alain Resnais (France, Japan: Argos-Films, Como Films, Daiei Studios, Path\u00e9 Entertainment, 1959). Everything goes ahead in advance. In the light of recent street protests for Black lives throughout the world, and in the more intimate light of local realities presented by so many fierce and tender collaborators during the Human Delta program in New Orleans, it seems obvious that the story of the Anthropocene River should be told in reverse. The journey started up north, but the postscript has to begin at river\u2019s end, with a social form of the not-so-distant past: the forced labor camps known as plantations.Visit the Whitney Plantation (https://www.whitneyplantation.org) or read Jared Keller, \u201cInside America\u2019s Auschwitz,\u201d Smithsonian Magazine, Apr 4, 2016, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/inside-americas-auschwitz-180958647. Their ominous or trivialized remains are preserved behind high levees that now protect, not sugarcane or cotton, but oil and chemical plants, in a place that everyone in America knows as Cancer Alley. The water itself flows differently there. The pulse, not only of the flood, and not only of our own bodies, but of the entire planetary metabolism, has been influenced by power relations that took both social and ecological form just upriver from New Orleans. These are race relations. You can see them in yourself, you can see them in the land. The point is to work through them and change their unjust consequences. The history of racism can become a hermeneutic, or process of interpretation, whose application to the past can transform the present.On history and hermeneutics, see Georgia Warnke, \u201cPhilosophical Hermeneutics and the Politics of Memory,\u201d Perspectives on Politics, vol. 13, no. 3 (2015): pp. 739\u201348. It can help a collectivity to perceive how a specific struggle has been inscribed in the landscape, in the flow of the river and in myriad present-day social and natural realities that are increasingly staring us all in the face.",

Stand on top of the looming levees to see the oil refineries, synthetic nitrogen plants, and ethane crackers on the landward side, and the ports in the river. Go down to street level and wander through small towns like LaPlace, where the German Coast slave uprising began in 1811.See artist Dread Scott\u2019s the Slave Rebellion Reenactment (2019), https://www.slave-revolt.com. Everywhere that hasn\u2019t been leveled by industry will reveal to you the property structure of the forced labor camps, which fanned outward in narrow strips from the riverfront where the sugar was shipped to market. Agriculture for profit was impossible here without great earthworks to separate the land from the water, and to protect the crops from the seasonal surge of the floods. The levees were the responsibility of riverfront landowners, but they were initially built and maintained by enslaved people, brought mostly from Africa on European ships as commodities for sale. We should also never forget that Indigenous people were also being enslaved, and dispossessed continuously.Leila K. Blackbird, \u201cEntwined Threads of Red and Black: The Hidden History of Indigenous Enslavement in Louisiana, 1699\u20131824\u201d (MA thesis, University of New Orleans, 2018: https://scholarworks.uno.edu/td/2559). Historians now say that this double blow\u2014seizure of land plus labor forced by violence\u2014is what made possible the spinning industry in both Great Britain and the Northeastern United States, at the moment when industrialization first took hold.This shift in historical understanding begins with Sven Beckert, Empire of Cotton: A Global History. New York: Vintage, 2015. My own approach is closer to Aaron G. Jakes and Ahmad Shokr, \u201cFinding Value in Empire of Cotton,\u201d Critical Historical Studies, vol. 4, no. 1 (2017): pp. 107\u201336. Yet there are so many other consequences. The gaze of our roving seminars, under the guidance of the local conveners, focused on the ways this social relation of violence shaped the landscape and society\u2019s relations to nature. The word shaping is literal. The earth-moving tasks that the enslaved people performed were known as \u201cmud work.\u201d In 1731 the French colonial governor \u00c9tienne Boucher de P\u00e9rier explained that \u201cthe lands can be drained and freed from water only by those who have negroes, since the work on levees and drainage is difficult and hard.\u201d\u00a0\u00c9tienne Boucher de P\u00e9rier, quoted in Christopher Morris, The Big Muddy: An Environmental History of the Mississippi and Its Peoples. New York: Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 58. The sentence, with its core concept of possession and its corollary of imposed suffering, is so repulsive that one hesitates even to continue thinking about what it means. Domination\u2014exactly what a US president recently demanded of the country\u2019s governors\u2014consists of an exercise of force condensed into a threat of death. When pushed to its extreme, it takes the form of a hunt with a weapon, which is exactly what confronted Black people when they escaped.Walter Johnson, \u201cThe Carceral Landscape,\u201d in River of Dark Dreams. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2013, pp. 209\u201343. Also see Sally E. Hadden, Slave Patrols: Law and Violence in Virginia and the Carolinas. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001. The reality of this threat, concretized by mounted slave patrols and dogs, is what drove the captives to the slow, painful labor of packing sand, clay, and soil into continuous hillocks, or digging ditches into watery forests, and then using them to float cleared cypress trees back to the riverfront. That\u2019s how the long-term transformation of the flood pulse and the aquatic/terrestrial transition zone got underway. The threat of death is what built the plantation landscape, against the rebellion of the captured Africans.",

Enslaved labor had been abolished, but the planters still expected their Black sharecroppers to rebuild the levees, just as they had been forced to in the past. These landowners, according to Davis, thought that the freedmen simply did not realize how much their own profit as sharecroppers derived from the collective labor of maintenance. \u201cIn reality,\u201d Davis writes, \u201cfreedpeople were asserting political power and refusing to do the brutally difficult and dangerous work done previously under threat of the lash, or worse. Across the South freedpeople refused \u2018mud work\u2019 of this kind without commensurate wages, causing paroxysms of rage among the planter class, who obstinately felt entitled to the labor of black men and women to sustain the precarious landscape they had created and profited from.\u201dJohn Dean Davis, \u201cLevees, Slavery, and Maintenance,\u201d Technology\u2019s Stories, August 20, 2018. www.technologystories.org/levees-slavery-and-maintenance. Ultimately the sharecropping system collapsed, like the plantation system before it. What remained was the social function of entitlement, specifically land ownership. The demand for servile labor would be fulfilled in the mid-twentieth century by fossil fuels and mechanized equipment. Davis\u2019s insight is that Black refusal of forced labor created a void that was ultimately occupied by the state, in the form of the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project of the 1930s. Yet the project was completed without any rethink of the initial land-use pattern. \u201cThe original conception of the Mississippi Delta as a carceral landscape, held together by coerced labor, curtailed any ability to imagine a radically different technical environment,\u201d writes Davis. It\u2019s as though river engineering itself had become a form of Jim Crow: the tacit maintenance in fact of a set of violent relations that have supposedly been abolished by law. To understand how the carceral landscape was modernized, I want to take you to the spot where large-scale federal engineering began on the Mississippi.

You can enter the area by car, no one will stop you. The scene is beautiful, deserted, invigorating, ominous.   Here in early colonial times a great oxbow bend of the Mississippi swung west, intersecting with the Red River at the northwestern edge of its arc, then releasing a more turbid and sluggish distributary, the Atchafalaya, to the south, before finally turning back toward its point of origin. Indigenous navigators showed European settlers how to shorten their voyage by hauling their canoes over the narrow neck of land that the French dubbed \u201cLe Portage de la Croix.\u201d An account of a passage by canoe over the portage during a flood in 1727 is given by a French missionary, P\u00e8re du Poisson, in Lettres \u00e9difiantes et curieuses, \u00e9crites des missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res: M\u00e9moires d\u2019Am\u00e9rique, vol. 6. n.p.: J. G. Merigot le Jeune, 1781: pp. 408\u201310: https://books.google.com/books?id=rgtAAAAAcAAJ. But after the Louisiana Purchase made the territory part of the US in 1803, the river would carry a lot more than just canoes. By 1830, the heavy keelboats traveling to New Orleans had been largely replaced by steamers. Meanwhile, the agricultural boom set off by the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 had supplanted the sugar economy. Enslaved people were forced to build levees and drain agricultural land in the Atchafalaya Basin, as planters started cotton production far from any reliable transportation. Meanwhile, further up the Red, unsettled territories could still be expropriated. But the Mississippi in those days was choked with sandbars and logjams. An emergent frontier economy demanded some unknown power\u2014a quasi-geological force\u2014that could clear the rivers for commerce. Henry Miller Shreve was a keelboat captain who piloted an early wood-fired steamboat from the Ohio River to New Orleans in 1815.Edith S. McCall, Conquering the Rivers: Henry Miller Shreve and the Navigation of America\u2019s Inland Waterways. Baton Rouge: Louisiana University Press, 1984. He went on to build new, more river-worthy craft with high-pressure boilers, making him \u201cthe father of the Mississippi steamboat.\u201d After obtaining the title of \u201cSuperintendent of Western River Improvement\u201d from the War Department in 1827, he designed a double-hulled, double-boilered boat called the Heliopolis. Outfitted with steam-powered windlasses and a battering ram, this snagboat could dislodge or crack a sunken tree trunk, then hoist it onto braces between the two hulls where it would be sawn into harmless pieces, to be burnt as fuel or cast ashore. With government backing Shreve began clearing the Mississippi between New Orleans and the Ohio. In January of 1831, he took a decision with unforeseeable consequences: he would cut the neck of the oxbow bend at the Portage de la Croix.",

Barnett Jr., Beyond Control: The Mississippi River\u2019s New Channel to the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2017. An iron scraper was attached to the snagboat&#8217;s windlasses to drag the excavated soil to the water&#8217;s edge, dispersing it into the current. Thus a new channel just a few feet deep was etched into the earth, ready for the erosive force of the water. If successful, the shallow channel would become the river&#8217;s deep bed. The cut would then be the equivalent of the portage, but for steamboats. It would shorten travel time, and, Shreve reasoned, it would pull the water of the Red toward a deeper and more swiftly flowing Mississippi. This would clear the shoals that continually formed around the Red&#8217;s mouth, impeding commerce. An open interchange between the Mississippi, the Red and the Atchafalaya would then take form, allowing steamboat traffic in all directions, plus further settlement of valuable cotton-growing land to the northwest, up the Red. The captain of the Heliopolis was attempting an integrated solution, based on the convergent calculation of multiple dynamic factors. Yet there was only one way to find out if his reasoning was correct. That was the act itself, the decisive cut. A week after the work was complete, the Mississippi had shifted its course. A new and shorter route had opened. What&#8217;s more, the sandy shoals at the mouth of the Red River began to disperse, as predicted. Yet as the water level sank in the abandoned channel later known as Old River, the behavior of the Red began to change. When the Mississippi ran low, most of the Red\u2019s flow would wrap around the bend of Old River to join the mainstem. But when the Mississippi ran high, the Red would seek a lower outlet in the Atchafalaya. What\u2019s more, the sediment that formerly gathered in shoals around the mouth of the Red had merely shifted, settling in the lower reaches of Old River. This new sedimentation blocked the free interchange between the three, to the point where dredging was soon required. It also encouraged the Red&#8217;s flow into the Atchafalaya. At the end of a long chain of unforeseen consequences, what appeared on the horizon a few decades later was a possible jump, an avulsion of the Mississippi. In the midst of some great storm the river would rage over its banks, tear through the low-lying marshes, and transform the narrow and sluggish Atchafalaya into its new pathway to the sea.",

Today, the former portage site is dominated by the immense system of cement-and-steel engineering works known collectively as the Old River Control Structures, whose function is to hold back time and preserve the present course of the Mississippi, while diverting thirty percent of its flow (and supposedly, of its sediment as well) to the Atchafalaya. Since their construction began in the early 1960s, these structures have been a ticking time bomb. When they are finally swept away by some unprecedented flood\u2014as they almost were in 1973\u2014the resulting catastrophic damage to the Atchafalaya Basin and the loss of the deepwater ports along Cancer Alley, plus the ensuing saltwater infiltration, will constitute a disaster foretold in detail since the 1980s.Raphael Gabriel Kazmann and David B.

It connected the river\u2019s sparsely populated western bank to the former Angola plantation, now the Louisiana State Penitentiary or \u201cAngola Prison,\u201d the largest maximum-security facility in the United States. This was the site that the canoe travelers chose to visit, in order to better understand themselves and American history. A series of plantations had been established here from 1826 onward, through separate land purchases by Francis Routh, apparently acting as a secret intermediary for the powerful interstate slave trader Isaac Franklin, who took full ownership in 1838.Robert H. Gudmestad, A Troublesome Commerce: The Transformation of the Interstate Slave Trade. Baton Rouge: Louisiana University Press, 2003: pp. 202\u201307. Franklin died in 1846, and in 1880 the land was sold by his widow to a former Confederate officer, Major Samuel Lawrence James. Since 1870 James had administered the privatized convict-leasing system that replaced the Louisiana state prison in Baton Rouge. Under that system the prisoners, most of them Black, were used alongside recent Irish immigrants to fill the absence of enslaved labor, notably for \u201cmud work\u201d on railroad embankments and levees. Founded in 1879, the Mississippi River Commission used convict labor extensively, for instance on the ten-thousand-foot Morganza levee constructed in the mid-1880s.Nathan Cardon, \u201c\u2018Less Than Mayhem\u2019: Louisiana\u2019s Convict Lease, 1865\u20131901,\u201d Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, vol. 58, no. 4 (2017): p. 434. James himself ran the Angola plantation with hundreds of convict laborers, while continuing to make a fortune off the leasing business. As historian Matthew J. Mancini writes about this abominable program: \u201cAll of the major themes of the period in Southern history were clustered together in that institution: fears of a labor shortage, racism, the dearth of capital, hair-trigger violence, the courageous efforts of humane reformers, and, through it all, the struggle to modernize.\u201dMatthew J. Mancini, One Dies, Get Another: Convict Leasing in the American South, 1866\u20131928. Columbia: Univ of South Carolina Press, 1996: p. 2. Convict leasing was outlawed in Louisiana in 1901, and the new State Penitentiary was founded on the premises of the former Angola plantation that same year. The penitentiary subsequently operated (and according to many, still operates) as a forced labor camp where prisoners worked on the levees or in the surrounding fields.William P. Quigley, \u201cLouisiana Angola Penitentiary: Past Time to Close,\u201d Loyola Journal of Public Interest Law, vol. 19 (2017).

More broadly, convict leasing throughout the South prevailed throughout the South for thirty years as part of a twisted transition to sharecropping. By the turn of the century, however, the sharecropping system was fully established and agricultural modernization could begin. Sharecropping brought a deeper and more integral transformation to the landscape. Delta Blues",

I will never forget camping on sandy islands draped in sparse forests combed into linear strands by recent floods. Nor will any of us ever forget the constant stream of heavily motorized tugs on the river itself, belching black diesel exhaust and pushing barges laden with grain, coal, drilling equipment and disassembled pieces of giant wind turbines. At one point, three armored military helicopters cut low over the camp. Wild miles indeed. When we arrived in Memphis we visited a museum located on the site of the former Cotton Exchange. It promotes a self-serving myth mixing curiosity cabinets of the blues with an open glorification of all the money that has been made off the cotton plant\u2019s white blossom. The National Civil Rights Museum, built around the motel balcony where Martin Luther King was shot in 1968, is the opposite reality. After beginning with Africa and confronting 400 long years of US history, you end up in King\u2019s room, feeling and contemplating that terrifying moment. Then you exit the museum proper, to visit an annex across the street. There you\u2019re invited into another hotel room: the one where the white gunman drew a bead on the civil rights leader. The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta is an agricultural region between two rivers, built on the deep alluvial soils of the Mississippi Embayment, which is believed to have formed as a vast salt-water bay over sixty million years ago in the Late Cretaceous. The uniquely fertile soils of this region attain their widest extent south of Memphis, somewhere around Greenville. Before colonization this was an impassable swamp, filled with cypress trees, twisting waterways and shallow, lingering pools: a classic aquatic/terrestrial transition zone whose precolonial configuration can be imagined by comparing it to the Paran\u00e1 River Delta in Argentina, which despite massive interventions retains an emerald world of wetlands, braided channels, and wooded isles, visible from the air as a distinctive bioregion.See \u201cDelta Del Paran\u00e1,\u201d Territorios de colaboraci\u00f3n (2020): https://mapa.casarioarteyambiente.org/featured/8617. The Delta today, by contrast, is dusty, dry, and laser-flat, covered almost entirely in cotton fields and dotted, in the fall, with large cylindrical bales the size of a truck trailer, wrapped tight in bright pink or yellow plastic. If you look, somewhere you\u2019ll always spot a distant line of scraggly trees snaking through the landscape, hiding a stream. Here and there, groups of cypresses rise from pools contained behind low berms. The emerald world has literally gone underground, channeled into a maze of ponds, canals, ditches, and pipes. It\u2019s an Anthropocene transition zone\u2014not just because of its specific composition, but because of the forces that have driven its creation and maintenance.",

But in the early twentieth century, during the heyday of the blues, it was a different story. This was a tightly packed landscape of small plots, company towns, shotgun shacks, juke joints, cotton gins, and prosperous riverports, divided strictly by race and unified by the overarching project of a New South built on highly capitalized but only partially industrialized agriculture. Sharecropping gave tenants a direct benefit from their own labor on self-managed parcels ceded temporarily by the owner in exchange for a share of the harvest; for that reason it was more attractive to freedpeople who did not want to work in gangs under direct orders. But the system tied them to debt-dependency at the company store as well as supervision and exploitation by the landowner.The best book on sharecropping is a testimonial: Nate Shaw and Theodore Rosengarten, All God\u2019s Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000. Shaw\u2019s father was a sharecropper. As in the antebellum South, all this depended on Northern and foreign markets, both for sale of the crop, and for capital to finance further swamp clearance and infrastructure. What\u2019s described in shorthand as a landscape was a whole way of life\u2014or, as the historian E.P. Thompson once put it, \u201ca whole way of conflict.\u201dE. P. Thompson, \u201cThe Long Revolution\u201d (1961), in E. P. Thompson and the Making of the New Left: Essays and Polemics, ed. Cal Winslow. New York: New York University Press, 2014. If you can imagine that this dry and dusty flatland was once a living wetland, it\u2019s pretty shocking to see it today. If you imagine what the whole way of conflict was like in the first half of the twentieth century, then you start to understand America. There is also an ecology of the Delta blues. In a brilliant book entitled Rising Tide, historian John M. Barry begins by describing the engineering program of the Mississippi River Commission.This and the following two paragraphs are based on John M. Barry, Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America. Riverside, NJ: Simon and Schuster, 2007. After a period of intensive research, the federal approach had crystallized around the \u201clevees-only\u201d approach to flood control promoted by Andrew Humphries and Henry Abbot of the US Army Corps of Engineeers. This doctrine refused the idea that artificial outlets could ease flooding, and indeed, it suggested that natural outlets should be closed. It also rejected oxbow cutoffs. However, as Barry shows, the levees-only doctrine took perverse inspiration from the work of St. Louis native James Eads, a self-taught engineer and a fervent admirer of Henry Shreve. Using sunken jetties made of woven willow mats, Eads was able to concentrate the flow of the Mississippi at its mouth, dispersing the sandbar that blocked the entry of ocean-going ships at South Pass. His success became an implicit justification for the idea that levees alone would create a \u201cself-scouring river,\u201d deepening the channel with the abrasive power of its own current and increasing its capacity to carry floodwaters to the sea. But there was a flaw: the levees, often set back at great distances from the channel, could never produce the concentrating effect of jetties sunken directly alongside the central current. What they did instead was to raise floodwaters to catastrophic heights, by totally eliminating the aquatic/terrestrial transition zone. Barry makes it clear that the engineering of the Mississippi River Commission did not only serve to preserve the market city of New Orleans, where many downtown streets are six feet below sea level. It also served to open up a new agricultural space for the South\u2019s most profitable export crop. The colonization of the Delta, still almost wild at the end of the Civil War, began in earnest with the extension of the Illinois Central Railroad into the region in the late 1870s. Other railroads followed, encouraging further swamp clearance and the perspective of a vast increase in cotton production. Yet despite the privately and publicly financed improvements, still less than a third of Delta had been cleared by 1900. It remained a frontier, a \u201cprecarious landscape\u201d in John Dean Davis\u2019s phrase, providing no guarantees to its inhabitants.",

The book culminates with the story of the 1927 flood fight in Greenville, Mississippi, where the liberal veneer of the New South shattered and Blacks were forced at gunpoint to carry out futile repairs on rapidly liquefying levees. Barry links these dramatic scenes to the Great Migration of African Americans to northern industrial cities. Exodus to places like Chicago and Detroit would finish what the water had begun, and over the course of the next two decades the social form of sharecropping would disappear along with the capital investment schemes of the New South. But the traumatic character of the Great Flood of 1927\u2014which left roughly a thousand people dead and a million more displaced, with major impacts on the national economy due to damages, disruption of transportation, failed harvests, and so on\u2014opened the door to systematic large-scale interventions into the landscape by the Depression-era government, including the Shelterbelt tree-planting campaign that attempted to build a leafy green wall around the Dustbowl, the electrification of the Columbia River Basin, the launch of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and, well ahead of all the others, the Army Corps\u2019 Mississippi River &amp; Tributaries Project.On the environmental policies of the New Deal, see Henry L.

Presented to the Secretary of War and by Him to Congress,\u201d Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 135 (1928): pp. 35\u201344. But this time the project was on the scale of the Mississippi Basin, and it included levees, bank revetments, strategically placed floodgates, pumps, upstream dams on far-flung tributaries, the Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway just above New Orleans, plus a system of three emergency floodways designed as territorial diversions to temporarily relieve the pressure of rapidly rising river stages. Entire floodplains were walled off to federal specifications, from the river\u2019s mouth all the way to the city of Cairo in the Confluence region. In parallel, the head of the Mississippi River Commission, an Army Corps engineer named Harley Ferguson, returned to Shreve\u2019s idea that the meander belt of the river could be deliberately straightened and made to flow more swiftly.Damon Manders, \u201cThe US Army Corps of Engineers and the Mississippi River Cutoff Plan,\u201d in Engineering Earth: The Impacts of Megaengineering Projects, ed. Stanley D. Brunn. Dordrecht, Netherlands: Springer, 2011, pp. 1451\u201363. Sixteen oxbow cuts were carried out by the end of the Second World War, shortening the Mississippi by some 150 miles. Only now are the long-term consequences emerging, notably in terms of increased bed-load sediment deposits in the Old River area\u2014exactly where the avulsion is likely to occur.David S. Biedenharn, Colin R. Thorne, and Chester C. Watson, \u201cRecent Morphological Evolution of the Lower Mississippi River,\u201d Geomorphology, vol. 34, no. 3-4 (2000): pp. 227\u201349. Also see Y.

The MR&amp;T passed its first test with the high water of 1937, when the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway was activated. A major challenge came with the 1973 flood, which damaged and nearly destroyed the original Old River Control Structure, prompting the construction of a supplementary installation just downstream.John McPhee, The Control of Nature. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011. Further significant floods came in 1993 and most recently in 2011, when the Birds Point levee was blown again. For nearly a hundred years, long after the disappearance of the slave and sharecropper economies, the MR&amp;T has defined the ecology of the floodplains, to the point of favoring corn, soybeans, cotton, and rice over any other life-form. The result, complete with copious amounts of diesel fuel and synthetic nitrogen, is one of the major components of global climate change: a completely industrialized agricultural system, based on fossil fuel inputs, oriented toward foreign markets, and exported to the rest of the world as a development model.On the Mississippi as development model, and an alliance of indigenous and environmentalist forces in response, see Robert Walker and Cynthia Simmons. &#8220;Endangered Amazon: an indigenous tribe fights back against hydropower development in the Tapaj\u00f3s Valley,&#8221; Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development vol. 60, no. 2 (2018): pp. 4-15, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00139157.2018.1418994.

Sometimes half a dozen other members of Deep Time Chicago would fill the home and even the deck of our collaborator Sarah Lewison, radiating outward during the day to different research sites, gathering at night with sketchbooks and laptops and tape recorders and whatever else might be needed to go on interpreting the landscape. Meanwhile the water kept rising. Just fifty miles further south the ruptured Len Small Levee (a so-called \u201cfarmer levee,\u201d not maintained by the Corps) had inundated large areas around Horseshoe Lake, leaving two hulking barges stranded in farmers\u2019 fields. River transport was paralyzed for three full months: you could see the tows and barges moored near the Ohio River floodwall at Cairo, a martyred city whose economy and civic services had largely collapsed in the wake of racial strife and antiblack resentment during the late 1960s and \u201970s. Driving southwest from Cairo toward the Bootheel region of Missouri\u2014a rich agricultural zone on the opposite bank\u2014I would cross the narrow highway bridge as slowly as possible, peering down at Fort Defiance State Park, eight feet underwater, where we planned to hold our closing field station events. One afternoon behind the floodwall at Cape Girardeau, Missouri\u2014birthplace of Rush Limbaugh, the bigoted pioneer of right-wing radio\u2014the river looked impossibly close under the bright afternoon sun, as though it were about to overtop the twenty-foot high structure. Parts of the city\u2019s suburbs were in fact knee-deep in water, like many other cities and towns on the Middle and Upper Mississippi River. As so often in the United States these days, you could feel the confusion everywhere, the disarray, the slow inexorable decline, the grinding collapse of empire.   The Bootheel story is characteristic of what happened to the floodplain ecozones. Formerly known as the Big Swamp and considered an impassable jungle, the land was transferred from the federal government to the state, and then down to county level, for improvement and sale under the provisions of the mid-nineteenth-century Swamp Acts. Valuable oak, hickory, and bald cypress were extracted toward the end of the nineteenth century, but the reclamation projects collapsed after the trees were cut. Only in 1907 was the Little River Drainage District formed by a group of large landowners in Cape Girardeau, amid the surge in steam power technology that surrounded the building of the Panama Canal.Kenneth R. Olson, Lois Wright Morton, and David Speidel, \u201cMissouri Ozark Plateau Headwaters Diversion Engineering Feat,\u201d Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, vol. 71, no. 1 (2016): https://www.jswconline.org/content/jswc/71/1/13A.full.pdf. Their plan was as extreme as the terrain: using the new machines, the Bootheel landowners would cut off the flow of swamp water at its sources in the Ozark Plateau and St. Francois Mountains to the north. To do so they created the Headwaters Diversion Channel, which is a broad open ditch flanked to the south by a levee, conveying the combined flow of the Castor and Whitewater Rivers to the Mississippi just downstream of Cape Girardeau. South of the Diversion Channel, a filigree of canals and ditches drained the land almost completely, allowing the cultivation of cotton, rice, corn, wheat, and, more recently, soybeans. The Bootheel remains the most profitable agricultural land in Missouri. But here\u2019s the question no one thought to ask in the 1910s: What are the consequences of injecting all that Ozark mountain water into the tightly coiled and intensely constricted Mississippi just south of Cape Girardeau?",

As prodigious rainfall swept snowmelt into the northern watersheds, the levels of the Mississippi and the Ohio rose ever higher around Cairo, until finally on April 25 sand boils began erupting at the base of the city\u2019s defensive works, heralding levee failure. Three days later the Ohio River reached a height of fifty-eight feet on the Cairo gage: that\u2019s the legal threshold for activation of the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway. But Bootheel landowners, acting through Missouri\u2019s Attorney General, went to court to demand a stay. In the press and through their elected representatives they pointed to the high value of their agricultural economy, flourishing on the soybean trade with China. Why should they be sacrificed in favor of an impoverished, half-ruined city?Lisa Song and Patrick Michaels, \u201cThere Was a Plan to Save This City from Flooding. But When the Rains Came, So Did Hesitance,\u201d ProPublica, Sep 6, 2018: https://www.propublica.org/article/cairo-there-was-a-plan-to-save-this-city-from-flooding. Never mind that thousands of Cairo\u2019s inhabitants would lose their homes, and perhaps some, their lives. The majority of the farmers on the Missouri side had long ago moved their dwelling places off agricultural parcels whose prosperity was built by federal investment in the levees, and whose title deeds include \u201cflowage rights\u201d purchased by the Army Corps in the 1930s. In a book with the absurd title Divine Providence, Army Corps historian Charles Camillo describes the tense scene in the operational center at Cape Girardeau airport, where the deus ex machina, Major General Michael Walsh, finally broke his agonizing hesitation and ordered the dynamiting of the Birds Point levee.Charles A. Camillo, Divine Providence: The 2011 Flood in the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project, US Army Corps of Engineers, 2012: pp. 59\u2013123; https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usarmyceomaha/142. Explosions flashed against the sky shortly after 10 pm on May 2. Just in time: the water stood at 61.72 feet on the Cairo gage. Another few hours and the city would have been destroyed. Earth\u2019s history is typically measured in the millions of years, arranged atop each other in a stratigraphic table. Understanding the Anthropocene River takes 500 years of human and natural history, entangled into the forms of the land and the people. That entanglement is the distinctive subject/object of Earth systems science, from my outsider\u2019s point of view anyway. Today, both the social and the natural relations appear frozen in the ghostly system, the MR&amp;T. Still the most relevant thing to interpret is the way the shoreline actually moves\u2014not only through explosive detonation, but also through seepage. There are many remnant wetlands in the Mississippi Valley, and particularly in the Confluence region. But the places where the aquatic/terrestrial transition zone reaches an ecosystemic scale often involve aberrant functions of the engineering works. One example can be found at the base of the Delta, just north of Vicksburg, where a federal levee system defends against both the Yazoo River to the east, and the Mississippi to the west. The double wall sweeps around the bottom of the Delta in a great arc, creating a kind of enclosing bowl with a floodgate for a drain. When the Yazoo runs high the floodgate is closed, and then rainwater seeping down from the north pools inside the levee system, causing major flooding that can last throughout the summer and into the fall, as it did in 2019. Obviously this is hard on the farmers, who expect dry fields by June. Everywhere on the back roads, small hand-lettered signs read \u201cFinish the Pumps!\u201d They refer to an Army Corps project that would have installed some of the most expensive waterworks on earth, just to drain the lingering pools. But so far the pumps have not been finished, because environmentalists care too much, resulting in a veto of the project by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2008.Melissa Samet, \u201cYazoo Pumps: Decompressed,\u201d National Wetlands Newsletter, vol. 31, no. 5 (2009): https://elr.info/sites/default/files/samet.pdf.

                "text": "The Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway presents a similar situation. A frontline levee defends against the Mississippi; but this is the one that can be dynamited at Birds Point. A setback levee a few miles east of the first is designed to contain and channel the diverted Mississippi waters; but it too has a floodgate at the bottom that must be closed against high water. That high water comes from the Mississippi River backflooding into St. John\u2019s Bayou, a former meandering stream now transformed into a wide agricultural ditch. As in the Yazoo Basin, the initial plan was to place a gate at the mouth of the bayou, seal it against the high water from the river, and install pumps to drain the swamp for agriculture. The Army Corps tried no less than seven times to complete this plan; but each time, the ecological values of this seasonally flooded transition zone prompted resistance.The last attempt was stopped in 2017: Council on Environmental Quality, \u201cResolution of the December 6, 2016 Department of Interior Referral to the Council on Environmental Quality of the Environmental Impact Statement for the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 St. Johns New Madrid Floodway Project\u201d (2017): https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/nepa-practice/2.19.17-Resolution-letter-on-New-Madrid-project.pdf The result is that every year, St. John\u2019s Bayou backfloods into the territory immediately northwest of New Madrid, filling the base of the floodway. This means that the floodgate on the setback levee must be closed; and at that point, the whole intricate system of pipes and ditches and channels that drains the Bootheel can do nothing but inundate the land behind the setback levee. At the peak of the season, usually in late spring, the inland flood rises to levels only marginally lower than the backflooding river. What results is a panorama almost unbelievable for those who don\u2019t see it every year: great sheets of water drowning farms and forests on either side of a thirty-foot protective levee that was built to keep everything dry and secure. This is the industrial version of flood-pulse ecology. Yet there\u2019s another result, which is equally amazing: despite all the grumbling and disappointment, the farmers return to their flooded fields every year, and with some help from small, tractor-powered pumps, they manage to get a crop of beans in the ground by July, ensuring a successful harvest from the incredibly fertile soil. Contrary to industrial expectations, these soybean farmers are beginning to live with the seasonal pulse, alongside all the birds, animals, insects, and fish that inhabit the aquatic/terrestrial transition zone.",

L. Hindle, \u201cPatent Scenarios for the Mississippi River,\u201d Journal of Architectural Education, vol. 71, no. 2 (2017): p. 282. It proposes, not single levee walls dressed against the river, but rather an entire sequence of fully contained cells, much like the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway. These cells can be opened and closed to support multiple overlapping conditions: natural marsh, dry agricultural fields, great pools of floodwater, or a modulated transition between all three. Like the Wild Miles, utopia is where you find it. As we approached New Madrid on the voyageur canoes, I expected to find something like the utopian condition that was later exposed to us in New Orleans. I had been to the area many times before, wandering around on roads and pathways that usually ended abruptly in pools of standing water or agitated currents surging through the forest. Now the idea was to paddle directly from the river to St. John\u2019s Bayou, through the only remaining breach in the entire Lower Mississippi levee system. It was a beautiful sunny day with seven or eight of us in a single canoe, and the fatigue of the river vanished as we moved up the channel, with egrets crossing our bow and big fish (probably Asian carp) jumping high out of the water. We reached the floodgate, pulled the canoe onto an extremely muddy bank, and went running up to the top of the levee where I knew we would see wall-to-wall soybeans, green like money on the world market. In fact, there was nothing but bare, dark earth on both sides. That summer, the floodwaters had persisted too long to plant. My spirit went reeling around this great wheel of black earth, furrowed in many places by the plow, but barren of any crop. An extraordinary feeling struck home: this way of life will also pass, like King Cotton. I just might live through the dissolution of the American empire. Horizons",

                "text": "This essay ends where it began, with the massive street protests for Black lives unfolding in the United States and around the world. The uprisings demand that we reexamine our histories, our present societies, and our selves. They ask us to change, not just the narratives, but the facts of coexistence. In the US, this demand is directly political. It concerns the administration of daily life: by whom, for whom, and above all, for what? Thosee questions coalesce around the figure of a fascist president, but they are spurred by a more ancient form of domination. Just go out on the street and look at the cops, mounted on horses, guns strapped to their sides. Do you see it?One social scientist links the perception of the police by Chicago residents to the history of slave patrols in New Orleans: Ralph, Laurence, \u201cThe Logic of the Slave Patrol: The Fantasy of Black Predatory Violence and the Use of Force by the Police,\u201d Palgrave Communications, vol. 5, no. 130 (2019), https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0333-7. Those who topple the statues of slavers, conquistadors, and imperialists seek the end of a 500-year-old hierarchy that stretches back to the period when heavily armed Europeans began to colonize, or simply pillage, the entire world. The same hierarchy stretches forward to the corporate extractivism that is now destroying the biosphere and curtailing the future of millions of species. It\u2019s not about progress, or not only: it\u2019s about ending the imposition of a power to command, with deadly effects on the river pulse as I\u2019ve shown here, but more broadly on the planetary metabolism and on our own heartbeats. At a moment of profound crisis at every level\u2014social, cultural, medical, fiscal, economic, technological, and ecological\u2014it is obvious, for those who see, that life is at a turning point. If we cannot seize the occasion of this crisis to reshape the operating systems of our civilization, then our only legacy is fire. There is no way to achieve this transformation, politically, technologically, or spiritually, without forming new and more profound alliances across many barriers of racism that our own actions, and failures to act, have maintained. Now I\u2019m addressing you, fellow white people. Just seeing is nowhere near enough. It is time to begin reversing the damage our civilization has done.",

It has been seen as an inevitable response to the technological revolution that is underway, epitomized by the ubiquitous presence of the Internet in everyday life.Sabria David, et al., \u201cThe Slow Media Manifesto,\u201d Slow Media (posted 2010), online (accessed 12/07/2015). At a first glance, it is about renegotiating our relationship with the constant stream of information, wherever this negotiation is possible. In the following discussion, we will suggest our own working definition based on the debate during the Anthropocene Campus and on previous definitions (in particular the one proposed by \u201cThe Slow Media Manifesto\u201d),Ibid. using comics as a lens.

It should be clarified that we cannot categorically state kinds or properties of media that are \u201cslow&#8221; or \u201cnot-slow.&#8221; When we speak of Slow Media, we refer to a form of engagement with media. We must also dispel the notion that \u201cconnectedness,\u201d accessibility, and specific channels of distribution, mainly the digital, are ethically opposite to Slow Media (Slow Media is not a refusal of technology). Firstly, digital media is a powerful means of personal and public communication and offers a wealth of alternatives to mass media and cultural hegemony. Digital media levels social and cultural inequalities, through such devices as file sharing, social media and hacktivism.N. Katherine Hayles,\u00a0How We Think: Digital media and contemporary technogenesis. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 18.\u00a0Its networked structure is refractory to the kind of state or corporate control we observe in unidirectional channels of communication, such as television or newspapers. Our online experience can be fitted to our specific needs, interests, and habits as well as provide spaces for participation and cooperation. Secondly, the effects of computers and digital media on our cognitive and even physical abilities can both be dramatic and nuanced, and cannot be shoehorned as unequivocally \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d It is true that \u201cbeing connected\u201d may promote specific behaviors, such as compulsive consumption of social media. It is also an endless source of distractions that demand attention, from email to instant messaging and even game applications.Hayles,\u00a0How We Think.\u00a0At the same time, this accelerated accretion of content has promoted the development of a highly engaged and self-aware Internet culture, which is generating something new from the particular digital environment that it inhabits and the ever-more atomized particles of culture. Collage, pastiche, and derivation have never been so popular in the service of creative exploration. Even though this trend does not restrict itself to the vocabulary of popular culture, the majority of these works range from alternate universe stories with the characters in\u00a0Game of Thrones, to improbable\u00a0Star Wars\u2012Sesame Street\u00a0crossovers. A particularly impressive example of this phenomenon is the monumental collective comics project\u00a0Bartkira, which repopulates Katsuhiro Otomo\u2019s dystopic manga Akira with characters and settings from the\u00a0Simpsons. Even though these works mostly appropriate franchise characters, they do so often by subverting social norms and the ideologies implicit in the original works.Suzanne Scott, \u201cFangirls in Refrigerators: The politics of (in)visibility in comic book culture,\u201d\u00a0Transformative Works and Cultures, vol. 13 (2013); Hampton, Darlene Rose, \u201cBound Princes and Monogamy Warnings: Harry Potter, slash, and queer performance in LiveJournal communities,\u201dTransformative Works and Cultures, vol. 18 (2015).\u00a0That these \u201cbastard\u201d creative practices find their place mostly on social networks (tumblr is a good example) suggests that they may be inspired by the very structure of social media\u2014specifically, the constant stream of unrelated information. The juxtaposition of unrelated material may generate accidental meanings and ideas that would not be evident otherwise. The participatory side of social media can be seen as a plethora of new opportunities to connect, create, and influence the world around you, whether as a fanart creator, in a political discussion, or in an online call for support for a cause. It can also be seen as (and sometimes simply is) a forced obligation, as media becomes more entangled in our public, community, political, and economic lives. This brief look into digital media suggests that what may be often overlooked regarding Slow Media is that different forms of engagement have different upsides and downsides. The constant, fast bombardment of information through blogs and social networks can also lead to discovery and invention through their own means.",

                "text": "The value of \u2018slow\u2019, work and privilege However, this issue does not address one of the most important aspects of the Slow Media rhetoric: that disconnecting has become a political act. As our lives become more steeped in media technologies, the freedom to opt out may disappear, which can lead to a democratic problem in itself. Corporate discourse and the productivism that have seeped into our social and personal lives place an enormous pressure on us to remain connected. In many circumstances, such as in academia, we are already expected to work anywhere, all the time. Connectedness has been used to erase the boundaries between work and everything else. By participating in this process, we are complicit with a background level of exploitation that is the motor of the social media industry (not to mention corporate and state surveillance). Our (digital) social relations are effectively commercialized. Thus, Slow Media is not just about reclaiming time from distractions and the alluring light of the screen. At face value, it seems to include an ethics of resistance to the dominant corporate ideology. However, this conclusion can be further problematized. Firstly, slowness can also provide a framework that goes beyond categorizations based on cultural background, taste and class, such as high and lowbrow, or classifications such as mainstream and counterculture, which have been compromised by the dissolution of mass culture into increasingly fragmented subcultures, and capitalism\u2019s assimilation of its own critique.Mark Fisher,\u00a0Capitalist Realism: Is there no alternative?\u00a0Winchester: Zero Books, 2009, pp. 8\u201210.\u00a0By placing an emphasis on our relationship with media, rather than the form or content of media, Slow Media further underlines the inadequacy of these categories in contemporary discourse. Secondly, slow movements have been criticized on the basis of their relation to concepts such as class, taste and privilege, and the slow media movement needs to be examined in this regard. Heather Mendick has pointed out that \u201cSlow is both classed and gendered, re/producing a particular relationship to self, which requires not just stability of employment but an individualist way of being, constituting selves that calculate and invest on themselves for the future.\u201dHeather Mendick, \u201cSocial Class, Gender and the Pace of Academic Life: What kind of solution is slow?,\u201d Forum for Qualitative Social Research, vol. 15, no. 3 (2014).\u00a0As an example, within academia Slow does not necessarily mean \u201cwork less,\u201d instead it means \u201cwork more with what is important,\u201d in other words research, as opposed to administrative tasks and mailing etc. On the other hand, the possibility of giving up these tasks rests on the obligation for someone else to do them. This \u201cOther\u201d person most likely does not have the choice to opt out of the task. Similar discussions have been lifted within the\u00a0slow food movement, the\u00a0slow travel\u00a0movement and the\u00a0slow fashion\u00a0movement, pointing to the fact that money and the time to hunt down specific types of food, travel, and fashion are not necessarily available to everyone. A slow movement is thus not necessarily a justice movement and, as has been pointed out, the \u201cgood food\u201d movement would stand to collaborate more with the \u201cgood jobs\u201d movement.See Yvonne Liu,\u00a0Good Food + Good Jobs for All: Challenges and opportunities to advance racial and economic equity in the food system. New York: Applied Research Center for Racial Justice Through Media Research and Activism, 2012. Further, the idea of slow as a concept that we use to valorise our time and build identity is steeped in a middle-class rhetoric. Most of the time, those who are working less today not through choice, but compulsion, are completely absent from the discourse. The slow pace of those people, who do not have the privilege to be able to slow down, instead tends to be seen as laziness. Thus, the kind of slowness being valued depends on the social context of the actor. As pointed out by author Tracie McMillan regarding slow food: \u201cWhen the food movement poses home cooking as a moral choice, it is making a pretty alienating, class-based argument. . . . We have to value work in the home. But we also have to be realistic about how you can feed your family if you\u2019re not a highly-skilled cook and you\u2019re already working 40 to 50 hours a week at seven dollars an hour.\u201dTracie McMillan, quoted in Rebecca Burns (ed.), \u201cFood Fight: Feminists and femivores\u2014Is slow food about politics, privilege, or oppression?,\u201d in These Times (posted 2013), online (accessed 12/08/2015). The concept of slow media may not embody these problems in the same way as the other slow movements, but the underlying ideology is similar, and this calls for afterthought. How can we on the one hand democratize media participation, and at the same time ensure that opting out is a possible choice? And perhaps most importantly, what is it that slow media wants to change? Is it individual lifestyles, or larger institutional structures? Can Slow Media be more than a buzzword that\u00a0fetishizes old media for affluent audiences, further participating in compulsive consumerism and aggravating environmental impacts and class-based distinctions? The discussion until now has offered personal solutions to systemic problems. While Slow Media proponents reject corporate control of the internet, they readily acknowledge the all-encompassing nature of contemporary capitalism.Sabria David, et al., \u201cSlow: The open alternative to platform capitalism,\u201dSlow Media (posted 2015), online (accessed 12/07/2015).\u00a0In a pragmatic move to address this reality, Slow Media advocates support of the hijacking of marketing tools as an adaptive strategy.Ibid.\u00a0\u201cSlow\u201d is offered as an umbrella term, a brand promoting an open source economy, leaving anyone who is unable to pay for expensive, non-corporate goods outside the loop of slowness. By presenting a market-based strategy, their offer is reduced to aspirational fantasies. Slowness becomes another resource for advertising, as exemplified in this\u00a0ad for condoms, which argues in favor of disconnecting, because digital media is distracting you from a \u201chealthy sexual life\u201d (and from buying condoms). These developments are expected, but they may not be the only possible outcome of a slow ethics. In the following discussion, we will address the issues of class, participation and sustainability in comics and their surrounding culture.",

                "text": "The cultural value of comics Due to their ambiguous cultural value, comics are a good device to articulate ideas surrounding class, taste, and ideology, as well as providing a specific social setting in which to \u201cobserve\u201d how Slow Media can serve as a form of resistance to dominant values and practices. It is their complicated social standing that makes them a compelling model to analyse the arguments for a \u201cSlow Media,\u201d and not any sort of structural or formal vantage over other arts or forms of communication. Comics are not satisfactorily described by any traditional dichotomies of cultural value or ideological allegiance. Historically, they are an art form conceived for mass reproduction, which has traditionally existed outside the power structures of the High Arts. Even within comics academics and artists, the social status of comics is unresolved, as some argue towards the (long deferred) institutional and cultural legitimization of the art form, while others believe that comics best serve themselves and the larger cultural milieu by keeping a marginalized status, unsupervised, and at odds with the tastes of the dominant culture and a certain notion of \u201crespectability\u201d that the latter usually provides.Charles Hatfield,\u00a0Alternative Comics: An emerging literature. Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 2005, pp. xi\u2012xii.\u00a0To some, this specific regime allowed comics to experiment and develop autonomously, in a \u201csafe zone for play\u201d where \u201cnobody is looking.\u201dIbid., p. 10.\u00a0This cultural isolation has led to the development of countercultural movements such as the underground comix scene in the United States, but it has also allowed the \u201cspeciation\u201d of highly codified genres such as the superhero in the United States, or shoujo manga in Japan. In this view, acceptance into the \u201cpantheon of the Arts\u201d could compromise the uniqueness of comics\u2019 culture. At the same time, it can be argued that the historical isolation of comics has sometimes led to a myopic understanding of the medium, both inside and outside of comics\u2019 culture. For \u00c9ric Maigret, who analyses the francophone-comics world, this debate exists in terms of a negotiation between two opposing forces: \u201ccultural legitimacy\u201d and all forms of resistance to it, in particular countercultural movements and the acknowledgment of multiculturalism.\u00c9ric Maigret, \u201cBande dessin\u00e9e et postl\u00e9gitimit\u00e9,\u201d in: \u00c9. Maigret and M. Stefanelli (eds),\u00a0La bande dessin\u00e9e: une m\u00e9diaculture. Paris: Armand Colin, 2012, pp. 130\u201347. Cultural legitimacy comprises a set of commonly accepted rules meant to distinguish institutionalized art forms from other cultural practices. They are usually imposed by institutions, policy makers, and cultural commentators.Thierry Groensteen, \u201cWhy Are Comics Still in Search of Cultural Legitimization?,\u201d in: J. Heer and K. Worcester (eds),\u00a0A Comics Studies Reader. Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 2009, pp. 3\u201311; Gilles Ciment, \u201cLa bande dessin\u00e9e, pratique culturelle,\u201d in: \u00c9. Maigret and M. Stefanelli (eds),\u00a0La bande dessin\u00e9e: une m\u00e9diaculture. Paris: Armand Colin, 2012, pp. 117\u201329.\u00a0Cultural legitimacy reinforces hierarchies of form, theme, and convention that are meant to protect cultural hegemony and perpetuate class privileges. For comics, it is mostly their \u201chybrid\u201d nature that is problematic: by \u201csubjugating\u201d text to image, comics symbolically reverse the supposed superiority of the written word over the \u201cimmediacy\u201d of the image.Groensteen, \u201cWhy Are Comics Still in Search of Cultural Legitimization?,\u201d pp. 6\u20137.\u00a0The scandal is both semiotic and social, as the written word constitutes the nobler mode of communication of the educated, and the presumed accessibility of images empower the illiterate working classes.Michael Demson and Heather Brown, \u201c\u2018Aint I de Maine Guy in dis paRade?\u2019: Towards a radical history of comic strips and their audience since Peterloo,\u201d\u00a0Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics, vol. 2, no. 2 (2011): pp. 151\u201367. A set of assumptions further hamper the acceptance of comics as a legitimate art form, specifically the \u201cessentialization\u201d of their features and audiences (comics are mass produced picture stories intended for children, the immature, and the illiterate). For all of these, Maigret argues that it is useless to work towards the legitimization of comics (or other marginal forms), because the criteria for legitimization exclude comics in principle. Nowadays, the dominant discourse commonly addresses the arbitrariness of hierarchies in the arts.Maigret, \u201cBande dessin\u00e9e et postl\u00e9gitimit\u00e9.\u201d\u00a0Maigret calls this environment a \u201cpost-legitimate\u201d culture, where references to legitimacy are increasingly inadequate. He suggests that comics should look instead for \u201crecognition\u201d of their own attributes and merits, placing an emphasis on individual achievements and not on the virtues of an entire medium. This \u201cpost-legitimate\u201d environment has also seen a general opening up of comics to the discourse and formalities of the fine arts, as in the works of authors such as Gary Panter, Yuichi Yokoyama, and CF. This movement is not unidirectional, but radiating, frequently involving a mix of references and aesthetic vocabulary from low- and highbrow sources, further undermining any attempts at categorization. Thus, it seems that when everything is fair game, comics are encouraged to expand in form and content, in an increasing dialogue with other arts. But whether comics are or should be an institutionalized art form, is just part of the crisis of identity of comics in traditional paradigms. For example, American mainstream comics, which are mostly populated by superheroes, do not benefit from the cultural capital that its designation implies. Superhero comics were effectively mainstream in their early days, when they were sold in newsstands throughout the United States, with monthly circulations in the millions.Matthew Pustz,\u00a0Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and true believers. Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 1999, p. 33.\u00a0Nowadays, they are sold in specialty stores, and mostly appeal to a niche audience that is well versed in the conventions of the genre and the backstories of its characters and universes.Ibid.\u00a0They are the \u201cmainstream\u201d of comic book culture not because they have conquered a mainstream audience, but because they form an established industry that represents the largest share of the comic book market in the United States. In fact, superheroes are just the visible face of a subculture that values specific forms and genres in detriment of the dominant forms in the larger culture.Benjamin Woo, \u201cThe Android\u2019s Dungeon: Comic-bookstores, cultural spaces, and the social practices of audiences,\u201d\u00a0Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics, vol. 2, no. 2 (2011): pp. 125\u201336.",

                "text": "The different faces of the comic profession and participation However, even though superhero comics resist dominant cultural norms in respect of form and aesthetics, the genre still largely subscribes to dominant social values, including narrative, political, cultural, racial, and sexual biases (exceptions notwithstanding). In addition, they are produced through an assembly line-like process that involves several writers and artists. These creators are hired to continuously develop characters and series in never-ending narratives within a shared universe, all of it owned by the publishing house. The extremely intertwined nature of these narratives produces captivating results in fictional world building, while compelling the reader to buy as many titles as possible, in order to comprehend all the ramifications of these stories. So, even though they are a niche product for an extremely engaged audience, the making of superhero comics approximates industrial standards of production, accompanied by narrative strategies that promote compulsory consumerism. Generally speaking, it is an industry that awards the ability to work fast and produce derivative and easily recognizable material. This is not to say that all superhero comics are highly derivative, or that derivation\u00a0per se\u00a0is inherently bad. Even though they comprise an industry in which their creative process resembles an assembly line-like process, the fact is that these works are still performed through a complex collaborative artistic process, similar to that the slow media proponents advocate. In fact, this industrial process is still able to harbor countless celebrated works for their technical and artistic achievement. From a material point of view, comics-making is very time-consuming, and is generally a solitary occupation (some artists work in shared studios). But they are also very cheap compared to other visual narrative media such as film or animation. They require only one person to create the whole work (working as writer, artist, letterer, editor, etc.), and whichever achievements or shortcomings are the author\u2019s responsibility. It is a very accessible visual narrative media in terms of production, even if it requires extensive training and practice (many comics artists are self-taught), and even if its vocabulary (i.e. the conventions of comics such as word balloons) isn\u2019t as universal as it is usually proposed to be. It is also a very powerful means to construct whole fictional universes without resorting to expensive means, collaborators, and technology. Thus, the cultural status of comics depends on who we ask. They can be simultaneously high- and lowbrow, industrial and authorial, mainstream and countercultural. Pinpointing comics as a whole along these axes will only reinforce the obsolescence of their criteria. Their slowness also allows us to make significant (and often conflicting) observations on their actual and potential value as a general creative and communication process.",

Cyclically, superhero publishers resort to strategies of increasing sales by appealing to the collectible value of their comics or by interconnecting stories to coerce their readers into buying many more titles. For these reasons, the commercial aspects of \u201cmainstream\u201d comics do not reflect a Slow Media ethics of production, being mostly an industrial product following genre and editorial guidelines, which are designed for a specific audience. On the other hand, the current independent comics scene is made up of either authors who actively react against the corporatist ethics and models of \u201cmainstream\u201d comics, or, increasingly, authors who come from \u201coutside\u201d the field and approach the media from a fine arts perspective. Overall, these are authors that use comics as a cheap mode of expression, to produce works with highbrow intentions. Even though they distance themselves from the formulas of mass culture, and generally favor a critical perspective on comics and the broader society, they can still be regarded as favoring consumerism, offering alternative consumptions, rather than an alternative to consumer culture. In fact, the lines blur at comic book stores, where we can find mainstream, independent, and even self-published comics (naturally, with varying degrees of prominence). At the same time, comic book stores are places of social engagement, where customers go to buy but also to discuss comics in their various manifestations. In this regard, comics in general are not necessarily aligned with a culture of careful management of resources, even though an attention to the object can promote a deeper engagement with the floppy magazine, or the book, and their mechanical and material properties. Nevertheless, a culture of resistance to dominant values based on commercial success still exists, in particular in the more restricted circles of self-publishing and comics zines.",

                "text": "Confluence Ecologies (Field Station 4) takes its name from the meeting of two great rivers, the Mississippi and the Ohio. But it also refers to the multiple ecoregions that overlap and intertwine in Southern Illinois. The Ozark Highlands border us to the west. The Interior Plateau comes on with thick oak-hickory forests from the east. The glacially sculpted River Valleys and Hills to the north are dominated by corn and soybeans, with trees across the highlands and coal beneath the fields. To the southwest, a vast Alluvial Plain marks the outline of the sixty-million-year-old Mississippi Embayment, which gradually filled up with sediment from the river and is best known today for its Mississippi Delta blues. Alongside it, the Loess Plains prolong the incredible fertility of the Delta soils. All this is the Confluence region. And a hyper-active human population changes it continually. Field Station 4 is about political ecology. Our Sunday bus tour began with the Cache River Valley at the southern tip of Illinois, about an hour south of Carbondale. This was an ancient bed of the Ohio River, formed by glacial advances and melt episodes between eight and twenty-five thousand years ago. When Europeans first came it was a sunken pond-and-swamp complex, filled with bottomland hardwoods and a great variety of birds. Early settlers moved onward to farm the rich northern plains, but latecomers eventually lingered and began to drain the swamps in the early twentieth century. The idea of the bus tour was to look up close at these changes in the land.",

Large agricultural landowners pressed for more improvements, leading to the dredging of the Post Creek Cutoff, which reroutes most of the Cache River through an increasingly eroded gully down into the Ohio. In the 1950s a Diversion Channel was installed at the river\u2019s end, to shift the remaining trickle of water from the Ohio to the Mississippi. And the big farms just kept on growing. Local resident Max Hutchison woke up in the late 1970s to realize that the forests and pools he loved were disappearing before his eyes, dried by ditches and swallowed by soybeans. Our first stop on the tour was the breathtakingly beautiful Heron Pond, saved along with an emerald string of cypress-tupelo environments by grassroots and government activists in the 1980\u2019s and 90\u2019s. The journey continued south through rolling hills and river bottoms to the decaying town of Cairo, Illinois. It was a major river port up to the late 1960s, but local elites failed to accept Black people\u2019s struggles for racial justice during the Civil Rights Movement. Still protected by impregnable floodwalls built by the Army Corps of Engineers, the once-proud city in ruins offers its own mute commentary on the political ecology of the present. Our final destination was Fort Defiance State Park, site of the great river confluence. According to the historical markers at the entry to the park, Lewis and Clark stopped here for six days on their westward journey of discovery and conquest. But get this: The actual confluence in 1803 was somewhere way back around Second Street of present-day Cairo! The park that we visit today was slowly formed by sediments over a century\u2019s time. So don\u2019t believe everything you read. We came here to see two rivers meet, and to experience two performances. More on that here.",

The short answer is that artists start exploring the more-than-human destinies of a set of land- and waterscapes evolving over diverse scales of time. A somewhat longer and more sensitive collection of responses emerges from the exhibition Confluence Ecologies. Fish people would have loved this show. After all, they could float through a kind of temple architecture festooned with images of invasive Asian carp, before being invited onto a woven willow boat evoking an imaginary voyage through a mostly disappeared swamp. Entitled Reshaping the Shape, the carp installation addresses human visitors directly, but as animals. Faced with the uncontrollable spread of a giant new jumping fish that is replacing the German carp of old, artists Sarah Lewison and Andy Yang suggest that instead of getting all nervous and nationalistic about it, why don\u2019t you just eat \u2018em? At stake here is a biological or \u201ccreaturely\u201d relationship with the Confluence region. Michael Swierz and Maureen Walwrath offer a similar idea with their woven and hide-covered coracle boat: go out paddling under your own power into the swamp, to find occasional surviving remnants of the great canebrakes that early settlers cut down, just because they were in the way. The title of their work is This Is Not About Survival (It\u2019s About Bringing Your Coracle). Again it\u2019s a message of participatory ecology: in the \u2018zine that accompanies the installation, the artists propose that you could selectively harvest and replant those rhizomatic beings yourself, to remake the brake in the present. But what could all that cane be good for, one might wonder? Well, first of all, for fishing poles! Fish seek deep dark protected places in the river for shelter, and as for humans in this area, even today they like to dig. Inheritance, which is the name of a documentary piece with too many authors to list, plunges you into a totally dark space to hear mostly women\u2019s voices telling tales from underground. These miners, both retired and still active, describe such things as the distinctive smell of the coal seam, the ancient scaly leafless trees you might see falling in pieces from the ceiling, or in one particularly terrifying case, the deadly methane explosions that propagate in muffled blasts through the mine. Like a kind of living photo-paper in the darkroom, your imagination is exposed to intensive flashes of geology, labor relations, unemployment worries, group solidarities, on-the-job injuries, and ancient fossils, all of which is then symbolically served up to you on silver platters atop a mysteriously floating table in an adjoining gallery. On the night of the opening, a couple of the miners sat in the darkness listening to their own chthonic voices, wondering aloud about the meaning of what they do. It was a spooky moment that brought them very close to the concerns of the artists, who are obsessed with something called the Keeling Curve that shows the peaks and valleys of atmospheric CO2 levels over geological time.",

But a twist is added from the outset by Hopium Economy: The Chemist and the Breacher, by the artist duo Geissler &amp; Sann. Their work splices footage from the agricultural Midwest into two distinct video recordings of a performance piece. The video is then projected in a gallery that contains a complex scientific installation, created with significant support from the chemistry lab at the University of Illinois Chicago. In the video, actors recite carefully composed scripts based on real-life interviews and other materials that have been recombined for dramatic effect. The resulting narratives deal with the highly addictive uses of industrially produced nitrogen, whether for bombs, fertilizers, or home-cooked methamphetamines. Like Inheritance, this work attempts to understand how civilizational relationships with organic compounds are disrupting ecological cycles, through all-too-human outbursts of consuming passion. But the reveal at the end of the piece switches geographical rather than temporal scales. In a post-scriptum, the artists note that the laboratory glassware arrayed on a pedestal in front of the video projection is a more or less faithful replica of a similar display in a museum in Munich, memorializing the Haber-Bosch synthesis of industrial nitrogen in Germany in the years leading up to the First World War. The global history of technology is also a history of the local environment, and even of the psyche.",

                "text": "Born Secret (Cash for Kryptonite) is another multi-authored video that brings techno-economic history right up the present, by following the visual record of hydropower development in the nearby Tennessee River Basin. That story begins in the Great Depression of the 1930s, intersects with the military brass of the Manhattan Project during the Second World War, then spills over into a massive uranium-enrichment plant very close to the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in the 1950s. Through this lens, highly abstract concepts like the \u201ctechnosphere\u201d or the \u201cGreat Acceleration\u201d take on specific regional forms. In the video, these concepts get bound up with the festive tourist celebration of Superman in his own registered birthplace, the nearby uranium-processing town of Metropolis, Illinois. A scintillating image, an implacable text, and an out-of-this-world soundtrack make up a three-part dissonant harmony that keeps asking insistent questions: Why super powers? What is that mysterious green stone? Where lies the hidden weakness? The concept of the Anthropocene, like the Earth system science that produced it, inevitably becomes a world view. Scientists obtain this world view through orbiting telescopes focused not on the stars, but on our own terrestrial skin. A novelist like Kim Stanley Robinson can go much further, metaphorically transporting himself to Mars. Taking this cue, the video Timeslips by Jay Alan Yim, Marlena Novak, and Joslyn Willauer presents the voice, the viewpoint, and the acoustic imaginary of a future agronomist who has emigrated to the Red Planet and now looks back bemusedly on her early life among the barbaric societies of a ruined Earth. Many good ideas sprang from that disastrous beginning, to be sure: like an entirely new kind of aerial agriculture that is watered, fertilized, and monitored by drones, leaving room for unlimited ecological diversity on the ground. But the memories of the Blue Planet are also dark and turbulent like a Midwestern tornado (or is it a Martian twister? Some doubt about the accuracy of the agronomist\u2019s memory creeps in). Astonishing musical compositions transport you into affective landscapes of that dark past, while the woman\u2019s futuristic gaze continually breaks up into a cybernetic scrim that tears at the conventional flatness of the image. Startling transitions between the Confluence region and the Danube river valley in Austria lend yet further visual force to this piece, which is almost as deterritorializing as contemporary experience. The poet William Blake saw the universe in a grain of sand, and this exhibition puts the Anthropocene in a regional nutshell. The kernel was right there for all to see, just outside the building that housed the show. A billboard-size image of a leaping Asian carp proclaimed \u201cEAT THE RIVER, HEAL THE RIVER.\u201d That\u2019s an interspecies philosophy of reciprocal adaptation, in the spirit of everything ecologists know about population dynamics and co-evolution. Below it was a more ironic sculptural installation by Jeremy Bolen and Jenny Kendler, built up of a pyramid of lifesaving rings. Normally red-orange, they were repainted for the occasion with a perplexing commercial shade called \u201cclimate change white.\u201d The equally white lounge chair perched atop these lifesavers seems to sum up the predominant American attitude to environmental disaster foretold. Just like present-day inhabitants behind the Mississippi levees, this floating sculpture is Lounging through the Flood.",

Named after the ancient Roman goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility, and motherly relationships, the park is an inner city space that laments humans\u2019 lost connections to the land. CERES is your place for pressing a lemon myrtle leaf between your palms and inhaling its fragrance, for seeing white-faced heron stoop gracefully into the dam, for hearing the low hum of bees carrying their gold dust home to the hive\u2014it\u2019s your place for community, for building hope, for falling in love with the earth.\u00a0CERES Community Environment Park Today our field trip deviates from the elemental discussions of ACM18, and focuses on reestablishing new relations and resonances with place. We begin with our tour guide and bona fide ageing hippy, Ron, who takes us to the on-site EcoHouse: A fully off-grid electric, completely retrofitted Edwardian weatherboard house, which produces zero carbon emissions. The blend of passive design elements, recycled high-performance building materials, and super-contemporary technological components, interfaces with its human occupants to produce a \u201cliving\u201d infrastructure. Sitting us down inside, Ron discusses the features of the EcoHouse: What strikes us all is the experimentation that persists at the service of best-practice design. We venture outside to the back of the building to the growing plots, and a neighbor\u2019s cat greets us next to a vegetable patch. Wandering around the plots, Ron describes the arrangement of plants in the park. The fruit from some trees, he explains, is inedible due to soil contaminants from decades of the site\u2019s use as a bluestone quarry, refuse dump, and landfill. The industrial history of the site, at times, snaps into place in the presence of warehouses, workshops, and office spaces in the adjacent streets. Aerial transmission towers and high-voltage cables thread immediately overhead. Here in the back garden, dotted with compost bins, raised vegetable patches, and sunbathing felines stretching out lazily around the place, the presence of nonhuman others is evident; throughout the park, pet animals and urban wildlife live side-by-side. Platypus have been recorded recently swimming in Merri Creek after decades of absence; we assemble on the bank of the creek on the shared bicycle/footpath looking out over the spot where Ron joyfully recalls spotting them weeks before.",

Arriving at the Enterprize Park, our tour guide, Dean Stewart, is waiting to greet us. Dean is a Wemba Wemba-Wergaia man of Victoria who runs guided walks along the Yarra River, which he calls \u201cWalkin\u2019 Country, Walkin\u2019 Birrarung.\u201d Dean has more than twenty-five years\u2019 experience creating, coordinating, and conducting cultural education, tourism, conservation, and interpretation programs in Victoria. Enterprize Park, where we meet, is where the colonizing force led by John Batman first set foot in Victoria in 1835. Here, Dean asks us to reflect on our previously conceived notions of Aboriginality, especially in the context of the city. He reminds us of his own cultural connection to place that goes beyond percentages and phenotypes, describing himself as a \u201clight-skinned Aboriginal\u201d person. Such a point foregrounds the extensive excavation of Aboriginal lifeworlds that has taken place here, and the dense sedimentation of non-Aboriginal infrastructure that now weighs on the city. Yet, the tour is speckled with constant reminders of the omnipresence of Aboriginal culture, Country, and law. Dean begins his thought-provoking tour by eliciting a number of copies of early colonist paintings, pointing out the original vantage points from which the painters depicted them. From the banks of the Yarra River, we gaze at the heritage-listed Queens Bridge, which sits on foundations bored into the rock of an ancient waterfall. The waterfall is where four distinct ecosystems meet, Dean tells us: To the east, a freshwater river, and to the west, a saltwater tributary leading to a large bay; south of the waterfall was an extensive marshland, and to the north, where Melbourne CBD is today, was a wooded hillside. Dean says that this site was the umbilical cord between two Countries, and as it was also the meeting point of distinct systems, it was here in 1835 that two distinct cultures also collided. After ninety minutes, travelling no more than 150 meters, we walk the last fifty meters in a single snaking line, which Dean states, is how you move through Country. We walk following the footsteps of the others in front of us so that we minimize our impact and in order that we avoid disturbing other beings, such as the nonhumans we might call \u201cgame.\u201d Arriving at our final discussion site, still in sight of where we left off just across the river, Dean reminds us of our responsibilities to remember and unearth obscured histories in the land\u2014in its stratigraphy, but also of its living beings. It is perhaps fitting then, that we find ourselves sitting at the boundary of a manicured garden brimming with endemic flora; fitting that we should conclude here, at a conundrum of sorts. This is a private garden for the exclusive use of employees of one of the world\u2019s largest petrochemical companies, the headquarters of which are in the building behind it. The garden contains some of the Melbourne region\u2019s most notable examples of native flora, and as a result, it attracts birds not seen on Country for a number of decades. Teasingly, says Dean smiling ironically, we are not permitted to enter.",

With its many scale effects and asymmetrical local contestations, it is a time riddled with challenges to coordinate action and research. With that in mind, this series of conversations during The Shape of a Practice highlighted the many challenges of coordinating Anthropocene related projects at different scales, both spatially and temporally. Conversations aimed to share and mitigate the collective challenges of coordination by negotiating how context, power, and communication all factor into realizing a project or knowledge community while, at the same time, synthesizing how strategies can be translated into specific effects in the world. For this series of talks, participants are grouped according to projects at similar spatial or temporal scales and invited to share insights into how they meet the challenges of context, power, and communication. The session begins with a short framing by philosopher Patricia Reed, followed by three discussions approaching different scales of coordination. Dealing with a singular site, the Warsaw based collective Sp\u00f3\u0142dzielnia \u201eKrzak\u201c spoke with Gilly Karjevsky and Rosario Talevi about the complexities of working on their respective sites, both of which were repurposed for their activities. Following this site specific focus, Cape Town based anthropologist Nikiwe Solomon and Porto Alegre based philosopher Fernando Silva e Silva discuss the challenges of coordinating research projects that encompass entire regions. The final conversation focuses on projects that move between multiple sites and continents with artist Ela Spalding from Estudio Nuboso, geologist Simon Turner from the Anthropocene Working Group, and artist/activists Rapha\u00ebl Grisey and Bouba Tour\u00e9 who document and participate in the Somankidi Coura project.",

I think of frictionless, liquid movement, of moving onward without effort, my limbs melting into the surrounding momentum, my body fluently aligning with the bodies next to me as we are carried along. Flowing seems to be not so much an act as a state of being, a state that requires some surrender to another energy, like nature, collectivity, or gravity. Some things are compelled to flow, like blood, time, oxygen, rivers, tears. But while some things appear to flow naturally, flowing is never straightforward. Its ease rests on labors, past and present; its current contains fractures and frictions in the form of turbulences. Take the Mississippi River, for example. It flows in specific ways because of geological formations, weather events, and ongoing interventions by the US Army Corps of Engineers, including dredging and damming, that have altered the river\u2019s basin. The flow continues among eddies and interventions, but all the time it changes, too. I fell into this journey and went with the flow. I had wanted to write about maize\u2014maize as a \u201cmodel\u201d organism for industrial agriculture as well as genomic sciences and, more generally, for data-intensive evidence practices. I think it makes for an opportune companion for thinking about this time that some are calling the Anthropocene, because maize has developed with people and lands, and these lands and people have developed with maize. Enormous swaths of land in the Midwestern United States along the Mississippi River have been reconfigured to accommodate the industrial production of maize. This region known as the Corn Belt comprises 150 million acres that are almost exclusively planted in a corn-soybean rotation. Depending on one\u2019s viewpoint, it can be a devastating sight. One of the world\u2019s most diverse plants reduced to a handful of varieties planted in monocultured row after row after row. Not much lives in these fields apart from the cultivated plant. Landscapes without insects, without nematodes, spiders, poppies, grasses, people.",

This sight could be read as \u201cfood security,\u201d and perhaps induce a sense of comfort. For the local farmers, it\u2019s equally existential. But it\u2019s not that they have a choice. The image of White smallholding farmers living and working the land in ecological harmony perpetuated by popular imagery and Big Agriculture belies the reality of an extractive and punishing industry that saps the life out of people and plants alike. Rising demand for food, fuel, and feed is forcing farmers to maximize productivity, which is increasingly tied to data: measuring and quantifying nutrients, seed viability, weather conditions, planting depth or disease history are meant to ensure the most precise and economic distribution of input, be it seeds, water, fertilizer or other chemicals. A flow of data guides a flow of matter that secures the flow of food. My interest in maize stems from my fascination with the plant geneticist Barbara McClintock, or more precisely, from reading Evelyn Fox Keller\u2019s biography of McClintock, A Feeling for the Organism.Evelyn Fox Keller, A Feeling for the Organism: The Life and Work of Barbara McClintock. San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1983. Keller, a feminist historian of biology, has pioneered a critical history of genetics in the twentieth century, attending to how social and cultural aspects have shaped (and in turn were shaped by) the \u201ccentury of the gene.\u201d McClintock revolutionized genetics. She showed that there is more to the genome than just genes. Rather, she figured out, the genome contains so called transposable elements (TEs)\u2014\u201cjumping genes\u201d\u2014which make up 50 percent of the human genome, 75 percent of the maize genome, and 98 percent of the iris genome, to name just a few.See, for example, Barbara McClintock, \u201cThe Origin and Behavior of Mutable Loci in Maize,\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 36, no. 6 (June 1 1950): pp. 344\u201355, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.36.6.344 TEs are vital for generating diversity, as their actions increase the frequency of mutations. Human geographer Kathryn Yusoff deems the jump to be a good model of movement for reckoning with the inhuman timescales of the Anthropocene.Kathryn Yusoff, \u201cGeologic Subjects: Nonhuman Origins, Geomorphic Aesthetics and the Art of Becoming Inhuman,\u201d Cultural Geographies, vol. 22, no. 3 (July 2015): pp. 383\u2013407, https://doi.org/10.1177/1474474014545301 Though genes are us, there is something equally inhuman about their scale. So jumping as an epistemic move works well in both directions\u2014upstream and downstream, backward and forward. Jumping is flowing with turbulences. It lets me connect maize, the Mississippi, friends, and data. McClintock figured all of this out by asking why the kernels of flint maize, also known as \u201cIndian corn,\u201d are spotted. She planted maize in her experimental fields in Upstate New York near Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory and Cornell University, the two research institutions that would (barely) tolerate a woman scientist in the 1940s. Keller\u2019s account, which is partly based on interviews with McClintock, describes the systemic discrimination McClintock had to face every step of the way. She also documents her principled resolve and her extraordinary understanding and intimate connection with her plants, her \u201cfeeling for the organism.\u201d It took forty years for her research to be validated and recognized\u2014because she was a woman, but also because no one could quite replicate her technique of \u201cseeing\u201d chromosomes, the entities in the cell nucleus that contain the genes.",

Strasser has argued that the corn genetics community that was established in the early twentieth century at Harvard University laid the foundation of what would become data-driven biology.Bruno J. Strasser, Collecting Experiments: Making Big Data Biology. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2019. Its data practices, recoding practices, observing practices, collecting and archiving practices, as well as exchange of seeds and data, created not only lasting protocols and infrastructures but data science. I like to think that the colorful kernels of flint corn are the beginning of big data. They are nonbinary, carrying many shades of color. I hadn\u2019t quite realized just how many until Michael Swierz, poet, translator and \u201cparticipant ecologist,\u201d while clearing the back seat of his car to make room for journalist and author Fritz Habekuss, MPI research scholar Christoph Rosol, and me, handed me an enormous mason jar filled with flint corn kernels. It was beautiful\u2014small pebbles of magnolias, violets, yellows, whites, and blues. At first, I didn\u2019t really know what I was looking at. What would it mean to think about data through maize, to think about maize through data? For one, it\u2019d make data more tangible and material, add a temporal, developmental dimension to its analysis. Concurrently, diffracting maize through data can render visible how variant forms of maize, like patented hybrids, are structured through heterogenous networks involving copyright and patent laws, international development policies, population statistics, and logistical standards. In my work as a sociologist and sociocultural anthropologist, I\u2019m concerned with the datafication of nature and its social, political, and cultural ramifications. To me, the datafication of nature refers to a wide-ranging project that seeks to translate biotic and abiotic life into governable measures and values. It involves diverse practices, from digitizing natural-history specimens, to sequencing and barcoding environmental samples, to modeling vegetation types using remote sensing. Despite their obvious differences, all these practices represent attempts to abstract and reduce complex organisms and interactions into discrete data points. Yet, these processes are shot through with turbulences that don\u2019t reduce but displace complexity. In going on this journey to trace flows of data and maize along the Mississippi, I wanted to recover some of this complexity.",

According to Darwinian evolutionary theory, adaptions (evolution) of organisms occur over extremely long periods of time and no rapid mutations happen in \u201cnature.\u201d To be sure, this point has been a long-standing battleground in natural history as well as its successor sciences. The issue was settled when McClintock\u2019s work, which found the genome to be much more responsive than previously thought, became accepted. This motivated the development of epigenetics, which proved that environmental factors can lead to changes on the genetic level, thus returning scientific consensus to the previously discredited idea of inheritance of acquired traits. So, flint maize kernels changed the understanding of interaction between bodies and environments, making bodies coextensive with their environments. What I like about the story of McClintock seeing chromosomes that transform into jumping genes that fuel data-driven genomics is what it says about data. Data are the product of embodied labors, sometimes far away, but never entirely absent. In my work, I\u2019m concerned with recovering or figuring these labors that make data work, that make data global, and, possibly, that make data accountable. My colleague at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin, Christian B\u00f6lling, recently stressed the importance of \u201cmetadata provenance\u201d for ensuring responsible sharing and reuse of data as well as the longevity of the resource. Whereas metadata describe the properties of an object, such as its size, language, or title, provenance metadata relates to an object\u2019s creation and gestation: when it was made, modified, issued and who created it, contributed to it and retains the rights and ownership. This means that data models\u2014the structures that determine the entities that data describes and how they relate\u2014need to provide for data histories or, more precisely, genealogies. If we, for example, digitize a herbarium sheet containing (parts of) a pressed and dried maize plant, then we include relevant metadata concerning not just the physical object\u2014its scientific name, where and when it was collected, by whom\u2014but also concerning the entities and processes that contributed to its creation as a resource and digital object. But, naturally, there will always be data missing because they were lost or deemed not relevant or because the interface didn\u2019t allow for their capture. Data provenance makes evident the many steps and protagonists involved in making data. It also points to the decisions behind systems and infrastructures, decisions that often manifest as gaps and absences.",

We ate processed bread and processed cheese as part of a parking-lot picnic in front of a bleak supermarket in a desolate-looking part of Hannibal, Missouri. We learned later from Faye Dant, founder of the Jim\u2019s Journey: The Huck Finn Freedom Center, that this had been a thriving African American community that was destroyed in the course of the racist \u201curban renewal\u201d policies of the 1950s and \u201960s. Later that day back at our camp site, we ate a delicious hot pot cooked by our resident chefs and fellow River Travelers John Kim and Steven Diehl, made inside an enormous pumpkin procured by HKW\u2019s Neli Wagner from a petrol station somewhere near the Quad Cities. They stuffed the decorative Halloween pumpkin with mushrooms, pumpkin flesh, and cheese and placed it on a log fire, where we watched it blubber for hours. In Burlington, Illinois, we were treated to a collective feast by the members of the Aldo Leopold Foundation, who kindly and generously shared their delicious dishes with us. I ate mac and cheese for the first time. As Bertoni writes, \u201ceating does not occur alone,\u201d meaning that it always involves others, even if only distant and microscopic ones\u2014the gut bacteria that help digestion and all the human and nonhuman participants of the food chain that deliver produce. Nowhere was the flow of relations that eating enacts as present as at the dinner that was prepared and shared at the Black Hawk Museum and Lodge in Rock Island, Illinois. The women who cooked the food described how their dishes combined food traditions from the local First Nations and from Indigenous Peoples in Brazil who have been fighting to protect their lands and right to nourishment. Traces of maize have been found in the remains of ceramic vessels in Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and the Caribbean, some dating back to 8000 BCE.

Here, the provenance of foodstuff is secured through establishing traceability. This means issuing unique identifications to elements in the supply chain, from farm to storage location, suppliers, logistical units, and companies. I started thinking about traceability after fellow John Kim mentioned its impact on small-scale organic farming. We were driving through the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, which is home to many organic farms, including the biggest producer in the US, Organic Valley. Traceability becomes an existential issue once it is seen as a prerequisite for entering markets or, indeed, for being considered \u201corganic.\u201d One problem for small-scale operations is the time and effort spent on record-keeping and data management, which becomes all the more complex the greater the diversity of plants a farm grows. I imagine that tracing and tracking heirloom varieties and seeds that have been kept and circulated in communities across generations is quite an impossible task. Yet, like all life, maize retains traces of its close and distant relatives in its genome: of the wild grass (teosintes) in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua; of rice, from which it diverged 50 million years ago; and of sorghum, with which it parted ways only 9 million years ago. At the Genoa National Fish Hatchery in Wisconsin, we were able to bear witness to how traceability is being integrated into restoration efforts. Lake sturgeon populations in North America (some scientists estimate globally) have been declining due to overfishing and habitat destruction, and so the hatchery is producing sturgeon to restock the populations in lakes around the country. T.J. Haxton &amp; M.J. Friday (2018). Are we overestimating recovery of sturgeon populations using mark/recapture surveys? Journal of Applied Ichthyology. https://doi.org/10.1111/jai.13795 We arrived on a sunny day and entered a low building crammed with big plastic vats, each teeming with thousands of lake sturgeon fingerlings. They were no bigger than twelve centimeters but they looked their age: somewhere between 208 and 245 million years old. At the back of the building, a school class had gathered around an assembly line of volunteers who were tagging each fish using coded wire micro-tags. This is done so that, once released into the wild, hatchery-reared fish can be distinguished from wild populations (for the calculation of survival rates and population trends) and to distinguish between different lots of fish. At Genoa, they tag about 60,000 to 80,000 fingerlings per summer.",

The ancientness of the sturgeon, so present and visible in its astonishing body, was affecting, especially in contrast to the plastic-based hubris of the breeding program.

Like all living organisms, they are \u201cof all times.\u201dMichel Serres, \u201cThe Origin of Language: Biology, Information Theory, and Thermodynamics,\u201d in Hermes: Literature, Science, Philosophy, ed.

I\u2019ve joined fellow paddlers Audrey Buturian Larson and Steven Diehl in the sun outside the shed where the lake sturgeons are being tagged. We are in a somber mood, somewhat upset by the goings-on in the building behind us. A long conversation spins out that weaves our discomfort about the industrial hatching of fish in the name of conservation with our dismay at the \u201cindustrial production\u201d of students that sees them reduced to standardized assets on the balance sheets of corporate education. To our minds, fish and human bodies become abstract, commodified objects in the calculative logic geared toward the optimization of stocks. A couple of days later, we amble around the John Deere Pavilion in Moline, Illinois. A large display is making the moral case for John Deere\u2013powered industrial agriculture by bellowing exploding population statistics. Large percentages are printed all over the wall, an LED ticker provides the current number of humans on Earth, and a see-through plastic box is fed with a steady trickle of maize kernels. Each emits a click as it lands in an already vast sea of kernels, reminding visitors that another hundred, another thousand, another ten thousand humans have joined the planet, threatening its limited resources. KERNEL PANIC! The data that are imagined to reside in maize are vast indeed. With its turn to big data, Big Ag has set its sights on data as a new cash crop. The movement of crops, from farms to silos, barges, and processing plants to plates and troughs is nowadays accompanied by a thick data flow that is feeding more and more distributaries. Farm machinery is equipped with sensors that continuously send soil, land, and weather data and numbers on fertilizer use and water levels. These data can be aggregated to set crop prices or predict insurance claims or develop fertilizer. They can also be combined with data on land registration and credit use to drive the dispossession and privatization of common lands. Geographer Alistair Fraser argues that data-based precision agriculture changes the production of food, altering agrarian relations\u2014our relations, really, since we are never not inside the flow.Alistair Fraser, \u201cLand Grab/Data Grab: Precision Agriculture and Its New Horizons,\u201d Journal of Peasant Studies, vol. 46, no. 5 (July 29 2019): pp. 893\u2013912, https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2017.1415887 This is hard to see, although I was looking out for it from the canoe, from the window of the van, from the airplane flying over the Corn Belt.

This approach reveals the intermingling of the different actors and their associated competing interests. One has to take the side seat of the moderator and listen to each stakeholder in order to obtain a more balanced understanding of the situation. Here we take this approach literally by proposing the voices of forgotten stakeholders, i.e. those that contemporary Western capitalist cultures tend to view as inert and lacking agency. Agency, however, assumes many forms. It is a pervasive and inbuilt property of matter and part of its generative dynamism. From this reality emerges an intertwined flux of material and discursive forces. Thus we focus on the actual geo-/bio-resources that make (or break) the Maldives, such as the sand, coral, and the all-encompassing \u201cblue.\u201d Our intention is to raise the major challenge of representation, a key aspect of the filtering process. To address this aspect of the filter, we use computer-generated voices such as those used in GPS systems: a machine interprets the words that were attributed to these unusual stakeholders; the biases built into machine intonation are integrated as a coproduction with humans. Realizing what the Anthropocene entails is a wake-up call towards reworking and reinventing human relationships with nonhuman agents, be they plant, animal, mineral, or gas. All things and beings have the ability to communicate something of themselves to other beings, and what these voices are telling us is that it might finally be time to listen.",

We step onto ground that was located just south of the equator 300 million years ago, during the geologic epoch referred to as the Carboniferous. Presently, this ground is a preserved forest ecosystem, called Ferne Clyffe State Park, at the southern tip of the state of Illinois. Our guides, Scott Elrick and Jeremy Breeden, two geologists with the Illinois State Geological Survey, unfold a massive paleogeographic map, spanning 500 million years, and attach it to the side of the bus with magnets. As we gather around, clutching the circulating handouts and wrapping up in scarves, the early fall winds rustle the leaves in the trees. This is the second of several events to unfold over the weekend of October 11\u201313, 2019, as part of Field Station 4: Confluence Ecologies in the Confluence region of the Mississippi River. Field Station 4 is one of six Field Stations presented by different groups of artists, activists, and scholars along the Mississippi River Basin, developed for the ambitious multisite project Mississippi: An Anthropocene River, envisioned by Haus der Kulturen der Welt \u00a0of Berlin. The five members of Deep Time Chicago who organized this particular walk\u2014Amber Ginsburg, Claire Pentecost, Kayla Anderson, Sara Black, and Sarah Lewison\u2014did so with the intention of creating a provocative and exploratory juxtaposition to their sound and sculptural installation Inheritance (2019), presented to the public for the first time the night prior at the University Museum at Southern Illinois, as part of the Confluence Ecologies exhibition. The fossil forest system that is the subject of Inheritance straddled an ancient river basin near Galatia, Illinois, at its center a river that meandered across these lands 300 million years ago. The swampy peat soils from which the now fossilized forest once grew became the coal seams that have fueled the coal industry of Southern Illinois and neighboring states for generations. The fossil forest, a rare picture of a complex ecosystem, was rather rapidly covered over by fluvial sediments during a warming period that was not fully dissimilar to the one we are experiencing now\u2014albeit this one is fueled by anthropogenic intervention. We stay for a time huddled around the massive map poster, getting a grand timescale glimpse of the landscape, and then move on to the trail, making intermittent stops under and amid rocks that demonstrate events of the latter part of the Carboniferous period, the Pennsylvanian. Elrick offers the group a lesson about climate cycles to help us imagine the humid climate conditions that cloaked this fossil forest those 300 million years ago. Using his rare capacity for making incomprehensible timescales somehow comprehensible, he goes on to tell a story of one of Earth\u2019s heartbeats\u2014what, in climate science terminology, is referred to as glacial-interglacial cycles. Elrick explains that the temperature and atmospheric CO2 traces of glacial-interglacial cycles over time appear much like an electrocardiogram, with regular and predictable spikes and falls. That is, until, the geologic recent. On the far right side of this undulating line, we see a sharp, almost vertical curve, first documented by Charles Keeling starting in 1958 and continuously monitored since. This rapid upturn is called the Keeling curve, extending upward from 1958 as the carbon concentration in the atmosphere soars past the Earth\u2019s average high point\u2014250ppm\u2014and further onward to 409 ppm as of November 2019. This spike is a result of the anthropogenic combustion of extracted ancient fossil forest systems (coal), natural gas, and petroleum. Finally, Elrick offers us the seeming paradox that, though global warming does lead to more liquid water on Earth, as ice caps melt and as sea levels rise\u2014sometimes very rapidly\u2014it can also lead to less water for some portions of the Earth. For example, climate systems at low latitudes can dry up, causing lush plant growth to diminish and the land to become less capable of holding water and sediment, and thus more susceptible to erosion. This story is locked into the very rocks surrounding us.",

                "text": "Inside of Hawk\u2019s Cave, we gather in a vast negative space cut by erosion over millions of years. We are dwarfed under sedimentary layers that make an impressive cantilevered ceiling above us. Breeden demonstrates by voice and gesture that these layers are not a simple story of accumulation, one layer on top of another, static for infinitude. Rather, the layers were deposited, covered for millions of years, and over time eventually exposed, eroding into the shapes seen today. With his training as a deep-time thinker, he reads to us this geological story. Before departing Hawk\u2019s Cave, our guides shift our attention toward a tube-shaped opening at the top of a sandstone boulder, perhaps five inches in diameter and sixteen inches long. In that spot, a tree branch was buried in sandy sediment that, over time, hardened to sandstone rock. The branch itself dematerialized, rotting away, to leave this tubular space. A trace of life that was. So, too, the Illinois Basin, a huge bowl-shaped depression filled with millions of years of intercalated layers of lithified sand, silt, clay, limestone \u2026 but also layers of compressed plant material\u2014former peat soil that was covered, preserved, pressed, and heated, not decaying into open spaces but transforming into coal. Carbon. Accessible for human extraction. The coal layers are accumulations of generations of plant species that flourished in the high-oxygen atmospheres of the Carboniferous. The high oxygen levels enabled life forms to grow to comic-book size. Millipedes five feet long, dragonflies with two-foot wingspans, and cephalopods, squid-like creatures, the length of a baby whale. At the end of each glacial episode during the Carboniferous period, when climates changed from wetter to drier at the equator and soils became more prone to erosion from declining vegetation, a series of flood events prompted by rising sea levels encapsulated and preserved the swampy forest along the ancient river channel near Galatia, Illinois. The flooding river brought sediment out of the river channel and deposited it into the adjacent swamps, covering the standing vegetation and creating the anaerobic conditions that allowed certain sections of the standing forest, including the peat soils now coal, to be captured in time and preserved. The last generation of this flourishing swamp ecosystem was preserved as a moment in time. Only a handful of geologists and coal miners have physically touched the fossil specimens at the site of preservation, but entire generations of us have consumed this site\u2019s energy through the combustion of its molecular carbon. As we gaze at this contemporary forest growing from the ancient strata, standing adjacent to the Mississippi River channel and living during the sixth mass extinction, I wonder: Are we witness to this ecosystem\u2019s final flourishing?",

These developments have global ramifications, although the poorest countries and people are bearing the brunt. In wealthy nations, such as Australia, we can see the future clearly enough, but the preparation we are most focussed on is scaffolding the terms of our denial. Given this, the near future world of my novel might seem too close for comfort. The story occurs in an affluent Western-yet-unlocated setting where people are obsessed with imagining an imminent, life-changing catastrophe such as those that unlucky others live with day-to-day. Perhaps the most frightening aspect of this world is how thoroughly depoliticised crisis has become. In this future, we are experts at description and obliteration.

The protagonist, Max Galleon, is the wealthy creator of fully immersive disaster films which allow the rich to voyeuristically consume the experience of surviving catastrophe. Galleon\u2019s works are the inheritors of an ideological agenda that runs through present day depictions of environmental catastrophe in Hollywood films which, as Judith Hess Wright argues, \u201csimplify complex social structures and provide resolution.\u201dHess Wright, J. 2003, &#8220;Genre Films and the Status Quo.&#8221; Chap. 4, Film Genre Reader 3, edited by Barry Keith Grant. 41\u201349.

When the continually scrutinized sea levels rise against the landmass known as Pitcairn Island, and experts predict a catastrophe of world scale, a previously-thought extinct giant ground sloth suddenly stages a second coming. The event gets spun: perhaps the sloth pup signifies a new age for Earth, a return to the charismatic megafauna. The animal, dubbed Hope, disappears again as soon as it becomes clear that humanity will once again prevail. Presumably she will rest up, ready to be trucked out next time. Hope is required.",

In contrast, the ways in which we represent and think about the landscape today are rooted in stability, even though it is clear that large-scale shifts in landscapes are well upon us\u2014in the form of rising seas and sinking marshlands, retreating glaciers and melting ice sheets, cataclysmic floods, wildfires obliterating entire towns, and climbing temperatures redefining climate regions and entire ecosystems. We understand the places we inhabit to be fixed in place, findable via GPS coordinates. Our infrastructural systems and our political discourse, even as we speak of retreat and \u201cclimate refugees,\u201d cannot countenance truly dynamic conditions. In the Mississippi River Valley and the Mississippi River Delta, the latter being the context of the River Campus seminar \u201cUn/bounded Engineering and Evolutionary Stability\u201d was engaged with, fixity drives policy and practice. We build and reinforce levees to keep the river from overflowing or breaking through its banks. We dredge the river bottom to maintain shipping channels. We build water intakes and sewage outflows for neighboring communities that are predicated upon the river staying where it is. If the river changes course, our communities would suffer, and our very state lines would change. We can scarcely imagine what we see in the Fisk maps: an environment in which the river regularly jumps its banks, and where human settlements change with the seasons and with the varying flow of water and sediment.",

What practice, what process, would be capacious and flexible enough to support a diverse group of seminar participants in studying the control of the Mississippi River at multiple scales, along with its ecology and history? What would allow us to engage Nikiwe\u2019s introduction of multi-species ethnography alongside an exploration\u00a0of\u00a0microbes, algae, insects, and plants with Jelagat? Or to engage the landscape-scale analysis and diagramming of Jorg and Derek alongside the lived experiences and community-based perspectives of local experts\u00a0Tanya James\u00a0and\u00a0Greta Gladney,\u00a0or the scientific perspective of\u00a0Cyndhia\u00a0Ramatchandirane? We chose to build the seminar around the practice of drawing, with the goal of building from small individual drawings to large wall-sized compositions co-created by seminar participants. We asked: how can drawing support different modes of exploration and learning? How can drawing enrich dialogue and support multi-disciplinary practice? And how can drawing support the imagining of new futures for the Mississippi? Over the course of the seminar, we used drawings to tell each other about ourselves, to collect spatial data, to trace ecological relationships, to express questions and concerns, to make connections, and to envision new delta landscapes. Participants created drawings during every phase, as described in the following collection of texts and images. Using pen, markers, tape, copier paper, large rolls of paper, and artifacts collected at the riverfront, we created hundreds of drawings over the course of three days. Importantly, we also came up against the limits and fallibility of drawing, including how a strict emphasis on drawing lifts up some voices and forms of knowledge, while marginalizing other forms of knowledge and cultural practices (e.g., oral traditions). And also how the representation of environments and systems as lines, dashes, patterns, and colors too often elides human histories of racialized control, colonization, enslavement, displacement, and ongoing environmental injustice in the service of a false objectivity.

We create sectional drawings documenting the boundary between city and river, which is an earthen levee that keeps the Mississippi from inundating low-lying neighborhoods. We also trace the pipe that carries water from the river over the levee and towards the city\u2019s water purification plant, which supplies drinking water to the city. By using our bodies to measure changes in distance and elevation and using sectional drawings to document those findings, we become more attuned to the scale of infrastructure and also the flows that cross the boundary between city and river.

Our interest is in the ways in which engineered forms both restrict and permit flow, and in examining relationships along and across the boundary formed by river levees and the spillway structure. We continue to draw using clipboards and markers, but also bring with us jars and bags in which to collect artifacts for the next day\u2019s drawings. On the way to and from the Spillway, Greta Gladney asks us to consider her family\u2019s long history living alongside the river and in the delta, both in St. Charles Parish and in New Orleans\u2019s Lower Ninth Ward. River floods and hurricanes in conjunction with public policies and practices for river control and hurricane protection have displaced her family multiple times in just the past century. Today, a proposal to expand the lock structure where the Industrial Canal draws ships from the Mississippi once again threatens to displace many of the Lower Ninth Ward\u2019s residents. Back from the Spillway visit at Tulane, one group sorts and analyzes the biological samples we\u2019ve collected while another group learns about the history of technologies used for river control as understood through patent applications. Tanya James challenges those of us working as designers, planners, engineers, and scientists to rethink how we do our work to address the racial inequality, injustices, and violence embodied in present day infrastructures and their histories. For example, how do we think about, represent, and talk about the Mississippi River levees and their future if we understand that these levees were built up by enslaved people to protect the plantations and colonial society that held these people in bondage? And that those same levees now protect the chemical plants and refineries that poison the air and water of African American communities founded by the descendants of those enslaved people? The two groups come back together, and discussion coalesces around taking the notion of speculation that had been central to the seminar at the start, and using speculation to try to ask and answer questions about how we do our work. To close out the day, we ask participants to use cards to record their thoughts, questions, and concerns heading into the last day of the seminar. Day 3: Scale, negotiation, and possible futures",

Working together in this way requires coming to agreement on structure and principles, form and technique. How will we use this big sheet of paper? What is top, what is bottom? How do we reinterpret materials, draw connections, or add new ideas? In the first activity, all participants array drawings, artifacts, biological samples, and other materials from Days 1 and 2 on giant piece of paper to articulate relationships between different phenomena, scales, and systems. To wrap up, we organize ourselves around sets of ideas that are visible on the BIG drawing, and work in smaller groups to create new drawings representing possible futures for the river and the delta. With less than an hour to create our drawings, we use materials already at hand. We seek to communicate underlying principles and organizational structures rather than attempting to imagine what each possible future will look like. We tear open plastic cups and use wedges of plastic to represent extraction and toxicity as well as the arpent lines of plantations. We simulate a healthy wetland environment using paper, tape, and plants collected at the Spillway. We use tape to literally create a mesh network with no beginning and with no end. Each of the drawings and visual artifacts we create is a drawing \u201cof\u201d something rather than \u201cabout\u201d something. If you tug on the web of blue tape one group creates, for example, every other part of the network moves too. The drawing embodies the principles of interconnectedness and mutual dependency we are seeking to represent. The forested wetland another group creates is a model of a new kind of ecosystem where humans are not the prime actors\u2014the three-dimensional drawing contains within it the very sediments and seeds that would be necessary to seed such an ecosystem. And we discover new organizational and representational possibilities along the way. The segments of blue tape used to bind plants to paper form their own pattern, offering additional representational opportunities. Aesthetically, these drawings are unruly, even ugly. They exist not as an articulation of a singular vision, but as the product of negotiation and improvisation by many\u2014groups of artists, biologists, anthropologists, landscape architects, social workers, geologists, filmmakers, and teachers still getting to know each other, each with a hand in creation and none with ultimate control. It is perhaps more apt to think about these drawings in terms of world building, which is why the co-creation of these drawings\u2014describing worlds as radical as the one seen in the Fisk maps from 1944\u2014suggests exciting possibilities for multi-disciplinary, creative work in a time of crisis and conflict.",

With limited time and limited materials, we end up relying on observation and listening, synchronizing the imaginations and hands of many co-creators, and the serendipity of materials. The process of making each drawing relies on our ability to build trust and understanding between co-creators and to find ways to work together. It asks us to engage both the physical properties and the symbolic value of tape, water, plant cuttings, mold, paper, cardboard, plastic, tar balls, words, and markings. With these humble materials, we can help each other draw connections between local conditions and global trade. We can make tangible interdependencies between our respective forms of knowledge, between humans and other species, and between the our past, present, and future. And we can both make visible and reimagine our own disciplinary practices even as we reimagine the myriad flows of water, soils, life, capital, and toxins that shape our existence, often through, over, under, and around the hard lines we\u2019ve drawn in the landscape in order to control the Mississippi and its delta. These are the very skills and practices that we will need to fashion more just futures for ourselves and the ecosystems we inhabit as we look to transform watersheds, rivers, deltas, and infrastructural systems in the face of climate change, sinking coastlines, environmental pollution, and centuries of environmental injustice.

The urban grid slid by outside the window, residential vernacular on its third or fourth recycle, parched and decayed, with a kind of lost and disjointed vibrancy. Eyes on the traffic, my mind rolled back over the city\u2019s history: its can als and granaries and skyscrapers, its formidable industrial century since the arrival of the railroads in the 1850s, its suburban sprawl after the Great Fire of 1873, its postmodern decline made irreversible by the 1960s revolts and the capital flight that followed. Through it all, the university and financial sectors continued their endless rise. There is a profound violence to this place, but also a deep sense of regularity. Chicago is the race-riot city that turns civil strife into social norms, and splits atoms while abstracting material production into mathematical derivatives. Can you still experiment in a place that has successively been the transport hub, the stockyard, the workshop, the vitrine, the boxing-ring, and quite literally the laboratory of modernism? And what could this ideal of experimentation mean for our future, when its Promethean pasts have reappeared before our eyes as the new geological layer of the Anthropocene?

        "abstract": "In this reflection upon the Clashing Temporalities seminar that took place as part of the Anthropocene River Campus, Thomas Turnbull considers the non-fixedness of the concepts of time and place that represented its core concerns. From a fishing township in the Atchafalaya basin that has seen the ecosystems it has relied upon for generations change at an alarming pace, to the mis-memorialization of history and omission of the stories of those who were enslaved at a former plantation, to a scientific model of the river that both chronicled a past and focused upon a future narrative centered around human control, the seminar evidenced the troubling myriad of temporal clashes at play in the region. But acknowledgment of and engagement with these complex clashes, the author writes, offers opportunities for generating coherent responses to the seemingly totalizing notion of the Anthropocene.",

                "text": "Where do you stand? Simple questions can be the hardest to answer. In advance of opening the Anthropocene River Campus in New Orleans, organizers of the seminar \u201cClashing Temporalities\u201d asked participants to think very deeply about where they were. With a little reflection, it becomes clear that, the deeper you think about where you are, what first appears as a fixed substrate, firm and solid beneath one\u2019s feet, can\u2014with a little imagination\u2014become dynamic once more. Particularly when we let our perspectives extend beyond the diurnal and mediatic temporalities that govern our everyday lives, past the overheated pulses of human history, and, further still, into the fathomlessness of geological time. In response to our request, we received a number of accounts of terrestrial situatedness that attested to both the imagination and the geographic reach of our participants. A townhouse in Troy, New York, whose foundations rest on lead-poisoned soil. Someone\u2019s hometown near Pliocene ravines in the Argentinian Pampas, formed over 2.5 million years ago. An account of the Alpine-Carpathian Basin, where the city of Vienna lies and whose oil fueled National Socialism. A newly purchased marital home in South Africa atop granite rocks formed when waters receded from the Cape Flats of Gondwanaland. The unglaciated topography of the Midwestern Driftless Area. An archaeological site south of Chiang Mai, Thailand, resting on the Shan-Thai Terrane tectonic plate. The attic study of the secretary of the Anthropocene Working Group, built on Mercia Mudstone clay, remnants of the shallow saline lakes of the Pangean supercontinent, back when the United Kingdom lay twenty to thirty degrees north of the equator. Most of our participants from New Orleans noted a more immediate plasticity to their surroundings. Their feet rested on thick and fairly recently deposited alluvial sediment, a shifting morass that means the city is, as one resident later told me, \u201clike a concrete lily pad floating on a pond.\u201d A number of tools are available to interrogate the temporality of where we stand. These range from human memory and shared anecdotes to songs and stories, and the carefully archived records of powerful institutions. Geologists possess a unique apparatus for such time travel. With something akin to an apple corer, driven vertically into Earth\u2019s surface, they can extract an excerpt of planetary time. These \u201ccores\u201d are a record of the seemingly chaotic processes of erosion, weathering, and hydrology that are set in motion by earthly processes. When the sediment these processes create relents to gravity, it forms layers, and so within our corer lies a tube of matter, a punctiform snapshot of areal sheets. Such cores, in the words of marine biologist Rachel Carson, offer \u201ca sort of epic poem of the earth.\u201d Rachel Carson, The Sea around Us. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, p. 60. Their order, width, and composition\u2014or laminations\u2014register major and minor shifts in telluric keys. Cataloging present surface to deep past, cores can reveal myriad changes, from that of local farming practices to global climate, insofar as such change can register in the chemical composition of the core or in the pattern and spacing of its layers. The \u201cClashing Temporalities\u201d seminar was intended to consider the relation between all kinds of temporal registers, to see how geological, historical, rhythmic, and experiential time fold in on one another. Our aim was to come to a better understanding of the indivisibility of time into human and nonhuman scales, and to trace the causal relations between past and present that have contributed to the strange concatenation of human and Earth history we now find ourselves in. In planning the seminar, using a now ubiquitous video-conferencing software, it was clear that negotiation and compromise would be necessary. Each person organizing the session came from a different place and a different school of thought. A professor of coastal and urban estuaries, a polymath naturalist musician, a sedimentologist, and a historical geographer. Bridging time zones to reach one another, it became clear that differences in situatedness, scientific training, beliefs, life experience, and opinion would lead, if not to clashing personalities, then to clashing expectations as to who and what forms of testimony were essential to communicate the significance of the sites we would encounter. Minor disputes over content, partners, location, timings, and involvement were, to everyone\u2019s credit, resolved with sensitivity and kindness. The outcome of these discussions, I think, demonstrated that clashes can be generative, resolvable, and, in the run of things, can allow for a better appreciation of one another\u2019s positions and the constraints and achievements by which perspectives are formed. We proved that song can be of geoscientific significance, providing an emotive record of the waves of cultural history that have impacted upon the Earth, and that meditating on a core sample\u2014an exercise in temporal mind expansion\u2014can offer its own inspiring resonances. On the first day of the Anthropocene River Campus, we boarded our time machine on McAlister Drive, just beyond Tulane University. In scenes reminiscent of school trips of yore, roll call was taken and po\u2019boy sandwiches and cookies stored in overhead lockers. After days of intense meetings in air-conditioned auditoriums, it was refreshing to head out of the city, west along the sinuous Highway 18, the old River Road. For some, this was the first time they had laid eyes on the Mississippi River, and our local conveners, Bruce Sunpie Barnes and Amy Lesen, pointed out the almost absurdly illustrative sites as we passed by: from simple houseboats, which, like the state\u2019s refineries, exist in regulatory niches that allow their owners to subvert taxation, in this case by risking life on the water, to cropped sugarcane, whose remaining bagasse burnt like a fuse across neat, rectangular fields, its smoke adding an acrid note to the recycled air of the bus. As we moved onward, Amy and Bruce shared their wide-ranging expertise over the crackly intercom, guiding us through an environment in which the past and present concerns many of us had only read about were very real. As Amy noted, this region is less a still life than a dynamic \u201ccascading series of events.\u201d Our route traced permeable interfaces between industrial archaeology and hydrogeography. We passed the Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway, a vast sluice that controls the river\u2019s flow into the brackish Lake Pontchartrain. Amy told us that this mechanism had required more regular operation in a period of unprecedented rainfall. In fact an estuary rather than a lake, Pontchartrain\u2019s incursion into the surrounding lands can be plotted by the waiflike cypresses that have succumbed to the salinity of its waters. A more constant companion were the concrete and turf-clad levees, which, at twenty feet high, persistently obscure the river. To a well-trained eye, surface traces of subterranean pipelines could also be discerned here and there, furtively channeling hydrocarbons through thick and unstable mud. With considerable skill, our driver negotiated the narrow roads of the township of Pierre Part, in Assumption Parish. Our bus, scraped by the low-hanging branches of live oaks, came to a stop, and we poured out. It was an absurd entrance into this thick-aired site of backyard domesticity. Artists, academics, and concerned citizens from around the world had arrived at the home of a welcoming, if somewhat bemused, family. Thanks to Bruce, we were there by invitation. We were greeted by eighty-two-year-old fisherman Mr. Daigle, whose home it was, as well as his son Kevin and a cast of other family members and curious neighbors. The Diagles are Acadian, descendants of French-speaking people from Atlantic Canada who the British forcefully deported from that region in the 1700s. Geneve Daigle Cavalier and Tre\u2019 Michael Caballero, Recollections of Pierre Part. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2015. Mr. Diagles\u2019 home is raised on blocks. It backs on to a dense swamp, a silty interconnection between a series of lakes from which subsistence and income have been derived for generations. Mr. Diagle, seemingly amused by our arrival, immediately won our crowd over by assuring us he was \u201cnot a Trump man.\u201d Settled in his porch chair, he told us of the changes in the number and distribution of animals from which he had made his living: catfish, nutria (swamp rats), crawfish, turtles, and alligator. His great familiarity with the life cycles of these creatures and his firsthand experience of working this watery land have directly shown he and his family how changes in mean global temperature have affected their immediate environment and the prospects of deriving a living from it; put succinctly by Vivian, a resident of Pierre Part, \u201cthe seasons are messed up now.\u201d",

The majority of the Lower Mississippi\u2019s flow has long been diverted by the upriver Old River Control Complex, a towering dam that divvies up the channel and protects against flooding during periods of high water. The diversion of the river, which begun in the early nineteenth century, helps to maintain the wetland we found ourselves in, and contributes to the stabilization of communities such as Pierre Part. But any sense of calm can be shaken off by learning a little of the river\u2019s history. Its main branch, the Atchafalaya Basin bypass, is due to avulse, that is, to shift its path. This avulsion will occur when the 150 million tons of sediment that pass through the river each year sculpt a new path of least resistance through the landscape\u2019s topography. The last time this happened was around 2,000 years ago. A shift is long overdue, and humans may be helping to induce it. Increased rainfall, partly fueled by the accumulated effects of fossil fuel use, requires upriver floodgates such as the Old River Control Complex to be opened with greater frequency to protect downriver cities, particularly New Orleans. More frequent inundation of the upper reaches of the Atchafalaya is a gamble\u2014a depositional crapshoot that risks causing the Mississippi bypass to turn west and course though the Atchafalaya Basin, potentially destroying and certainly transforming communities such as Pierre Part.

Sitting up front with the microphone was research geologist and paleobotanist Scott Wing, a member of the Anthropocene Working Group. He has family in nearby Morgan City, and he took the opportunity to combine his concern for the region with his scientific training, giving us insight into the long history of hydrocarbon formation in this place. The majority of Louisiana\u2019s petroleum began its formation during the Mesozoic era, over 180 million years ago. As the continent\u2019s largest watershed, the geomorphological precursors to the Mississippi River Basin acted as vast catchall for accumulating organic matter. Organisms such as algae and plankton were drawn into the river\u2019s flow, forming thick mats of biological matter at the mouth of what is now the Gulf of Mexico. These batteries of decaying compounds were slowly inundated with layers of sediment\u2014a slow burial in a geological pressure cooker. Such was the pressure exerted that the Earth\u2019s crust bowed and subsided. The heat this process generated slowly altered the chemical structure of the entombed organic matter, cracking the former fruits of photosynthesis into reservoirs of liquid hydrocarbons topped by lighter gas fractions. Alongside the state of Louisiana\u2019s lax regulatory regime, it is this slow motion geological circumstance that partly explains the profusion of petrochemical plants that cluster in Louisiana. With a constant procession of refineries and sulfur piles passing by our now bug-splattered windows, the toll that our pact with long-fossilized biota is exacting was clear. This unlikely sequence of Earthly events found its way into, among other things, the pistons of our bus\u2019s six-cylinder combustion engine. There, carbon became heat, and heat the motion pushing us onward. We hydrocarbon-propelled planetarians were left to reflect on Scott\u2019s point that \u201ceverything is really connected to everything else, on short timescales and over many millions of years.\u201d Mississippi.

Our guide made some attempt to acknowledge the plight of the enslaved people who had lived there, but true recognition of the subjugation of the enslaved, and appropriate memorialization, were entirely absent. Besides a few anonymous inscriptions on a cellar wall, the tour concentrated on the ups and downs of the lives of the Duparcs, a French Creole family who, from 1804 onward, profited greatly from the use of forced labor to farm and process sugarcane.

We were headed there thanks to the initiative of Catherine Russell, a sedimentologist who carries out research upriver from the city. Pulling cores of muddy sediment from the land, she tries to better understand the complex reciprocities that have taken place between the river, its sediment, and the geomorphology through which it flows. Once more heading out along the River Road, we arrived \u00a0at the Louisiana State University (LSU) Center for River Studies, where professor Clinton Willson welcomed us into an information-packed visitor center. We were there to see what is perhaps the world\u2019s largest working analog model of a river system. At ten thousand square feet, the table top model fills a space the size of a sports hall. Varying sediment loads can be simulated across its vast planar surface, which represents the Lower River, approximating the alteration to depositional processes caused by upriver hydroengineering. Like a giant battlefield diorama, the model is intended to allow for strategizing how to best manage the coastal subsidence. As we entered, research-student Godzillas scrambled off the model. A bombastic animated presentation was then projected onto the planar surface of the model, with a disembodied voice telling of inevitable land loss and controlled retreat, a narrative of control projected by the LSU River Studies Center on behalf of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA). The presentation inadvertently made it clear that the model is as much a public relations tool as a scientific apparatus. It is used to demonstrate the CPRA\u2019s commitment to the scientific management of Louisiana\u2019s ongoing land loss due to shifting sedimentation patterns, sea-level rise, and land use. What lies beyond the artifice of the model\u2019s closed world are critical voices of those who see the CPRA as a malign force. Its $50 billion comprehensive Coastal Master Plan\u2014published in 2017 and outlining the protection of this section of the Gulf Coast via restructuring, restoration, and resettlement\u2014is considered by some to be insensitive to the lives and livelihoods of those who make their home in the area.

Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2020. Given that the largest tranche of funding for the CPRA plan comes from BP, as recompense for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and that another oil major had reputedly paid for the $15 LSU million model, critical voices argued that this mediatic apparatus offers nothing more than a distraction. Among the biggest criticisms is that the CPRA plan fails to act on the ongoing role of the petrochemical industry in accelerating land loss. Shifting patterns of deposition, upriver engineering, and the gradient of the tectonic plate that the coast lies on means subsidence is inevitable, but the incessant pumping of oil and gas from coastal reservoirs, the dredging of sediment, and the growing network of subterranean pipelines and their attendant maintenance canals speeds up this loss.Ian Gray, \u201cOutrunning the Anthropocene?\u201d: https://www.anthropocene-curriculum.org/contribution/outrunning-the-anthropocene The river model, and Nathan\u2019s interjection, emphasized that even when one is looking back to the 400-million-year history of the river\u2019s sedimentary processes, there is no aspect of science that lies beyond politics\u2014just as there is no form of politics free from the constraints of the physical world. The model, as such, reflects a wider problem. Like many forms of knowledge, basic scientific understanding about sedimentation, hydrogeomorphology, and Earth sciences in general\u2014and, in all likelihood, a vast amount of the research on which the notion of the Anthropocene is founded\u2014indirectly owes much of its existence to the petrochemical industry. On relations between the oil industry and the Earth sciences see Virginia Gewin, \u201cGeoscience: ups and downs\u201d Nature, 530 (2016) 371-372.  Without the deep pockets of oil companies, many geological sites would go uninterrogated and many advances in our understanding of Earth\u2019s shifting composition would not have been achieved. This does not mean we should exonerate a petrochemical industry that has long acted in full awareness of its destructive capacities. But it does require us to recognize that geologists are at the sharp end of the Faustian pact\u00a0 with the hydrocarbon industry that a great proportion of us have entered into.",

An Anthropocene River. The work of Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 cartographer Harold Fisk in the 1940s, the maps show the shifting sinuosity of the river over thousands of years. We disembarked from the bus on the western side of the False River Lake and crossed a busy road in a cold wind. From this spot, we could view the lake and gain some sense as to why such seemingly prosaic sites are so important for historians of earthly processes. It takes some imagination to reconstruct the deep history of such a subtly remarkable place. To a considerable degree, geology is a feat of the imagination, using points of evidence from sites like the one before us to reconstruct a deep understanding of the processes that fashioned our terrestrial home. By now, tiredness hung over the group as a result of the steady influx of encounters: we had experienced the imagination and creativity that lies behind geoscientific rigor, while geoscientists had experienced the rigor, critical voices, and breadth of knowledge that underlies many forms of humanistic expression. Points of coherence in world views had been arrived at.

                "text": "Introduction Economic theories matter: they dominate how various societal problems are framed in political discussions and which political actions are considered feasible. One could even say that economics is one of the academic disciplines in which science and politics\u2014understood as the art of governance\u2014are most entangled. Furthermore, economics provides arguments for proponents of an economic system that incorporates increasingly more aspects of the lives of more and more people. Capitalist production patterns and Western lifestyles are spreading around the globe. Commodity markets and financial markets are growing together, enabling access to ever increasing possibilities but also causing unprecedented changes in the environment and threatening human well-being and survival. This implies far-reaching challenges for environmental governance to secure the livelihoods of the current generation as well as those of future generations. These strong feedback loops, between humans and their technology\u2014as, for instance, conceptualized in the notions of the anthroposphere or the technosphere on the one hand, and other biophysical spheres of the Earth system on the other\u2014are one of the main themes of the Anthropocene discourse. Taking up the notion from geology, the concept of the Anthropocene is now also discussed within the humanities and social sciences. This discussion takes the observations of ever-increasing anthropogenic changes to the Earth as a starting point to reflect on both human\u2012nature relationships and the underlying epistemological frameworks. In this essay, I argue that these frameworks are especially important with regard to economic questions. In the economics literature, there are ongoing debates about the framing of environmental issues, particularly between environmental and ecological economists. However, these debates are hardly reflected in economics teaching as economists tend to be trained in very specific theories, which strongly influence the way they frame societal problems. Through implementation of new markets and policies to solve these problems, this thinking increasingly influences the organization of many societies. I argue that a rethinking of economics education in line with pluralist accounts is necessary, in order to allow future economists to solve ecological problems characteristic of the Anthropocene. Framing Economics Defining economics is a difficult task: some economists define it as a discipline concerned with the allocation of scarce resources, while others define it with respect to its method (optimization under constraints) or its objects (markets). Whatever the definition, it is important to point out that economics is not a homogeneous academic discipline with canonical assumptions shared by every scholar practicing economics, but that there are different schools of thought that promote sometimes incompatible theories. Mainstream economics, with the neoclassical paradigm at its core, largely dominates the academic discourse. Although the mainstream embraces new approaches such as behavioral economics, many economists have a narrow understanding of valid ways to do economics. Thus, alternative schools such as Post-Keynesian, Marxian, Austrian, evolutionary, feminist, or institutional approaches are often marginalized. With respect to environmental issues such as natural resource depletion, pollution, and climate change, different and sometimes opposing economic views are debated between environmental economics, the mainstream analysis of economic interactions with the environment, and alternative schools of thought, mainly ecological economics, a heterogeneous and transdisciplinary field that challenges mainstream convictions.Malte Faber, \u201cHow to Be an Ecological Economist,\u201d Ecological Economics, vol. 66, no. 1 (2008): pp. 1\u20127. David Pearce, \u201cAn Intellectual History of Environmental Economics,\u201dAnnual Review of Energy and the Environment, vol. 27, no. 1 (2002): pp. 57\u201381. Jeroen C. J. M. Van den Bergh, \u201cEcological Economics: Themes, Approaches, and Differences with Environmental Economics,\u201d Regional Environmental Change, vol. 2, no. 1 (2001): pp. 13\u201223. The label \u201cecological economics\u201d may not be embraced by all heterodox scholars concerned with environmental topics, and the boundaries between ecological economics and other approaches such as evolutionary, Post-Keynesian, and institutional economics are blurry.Gerardo Marletto (ed.), Creating a Sustainable Economy: An institutional and evolutionary approach to environmental policy. London: Routledge, 2012.\u00a0I will nevertheless use this label in the essay to designate heterodox positions on environmental questions. In the following sections, I introduce the main arguments and points of divergence in the debate. As we will see, the framing of the same problems can lead to very different conclusions about desired actions. Economic\u2012Environmental Relations and Valuation of Ecosystems A very general difference is the ontological understanding of how economies, societies, and ecosystems relate to one another. Environmental economists tend to frame the economy as external to the ecosystem. Of course, human actions may change the ecosystem, but for environmental economists this seems important only insofar as the changes influence other people\u2019s lives and decisions. In contrast, ecological economists conceive the economy as a subsystem of society and as a part of the ecosystem.Robert Costanza et al., An Introduction to Ecological Economics.Boca Raton, FL: St. Lucie Press and the International Society for Ecological Economics, 1997. They emphasize the co-evolution between economic and ecological systems and criticize the increasing colonization of nature: i.e. the human effort to control and instrumentalize ecosystems. Often, ecological economists consider environmental problems as much more severe than their environmental colleagues do, and recognize that the solution of these problems is not only a question of the correct economic policy. One of the core questions economists deal with is how to value nature. This is discussed, for instance, in the framework of ecosystem services. Mainstream economists often aim at an economic valuation: i.e. putting a price on ecosystem services such as water provision, climate regulation, or air purification. If ecosystem services are priced incorrectly, or if their use is not restricted by the state, they may be overused or damaged. Ecological economists are often skeptical about the monetization of ecosystem services and environmental damage. People might be unwilling to pay for ecosystem conservation, either because they are unaware that the services are provided, or they may have limited knowledge or care little about the long-term consequences of ecosystem destruction (i.e. nonlinear regime shifts), or lack the economic resources to respond. Instead, ecological economists point out that economic actors are moral subjects, and that ethical arguments and social norms play a crucial role in ecological conservation. They argue that in light of our limited knowledge about the functioning of the Earth system we should apply the precautionary principle and refrain from changing our environment when the consequences are uncertain. Solving Environmental Problems: The Role of the Markets As economies develop, governance through markets becomes increasingly important. A central concept in environmental economics is that of market failure: allocation of scarce resources may not be efficient or socially optimal due to ill-defined property rights, externalities, or non-excludability in market settings. If these effects are significant, the social costs are not reflected in the price of goods. A particularly stylized version of market failure is the tragedy of the commons, in which economic actors overuse a common resource to everybody\u2019s disadvantage. Economic policies that are proposed to solve these problems include the establishment of clearly defined property rights, environmental regulations, and the internalization of externalities through taxation, subsidies, and other incentives or disincentives. For example, in order to reduce environmental pollution, environmental policies can regulate industries by setting standards, taxing pollution, or establishing markets for tradable pollution certificates issued by the government (defining a property right on pollution, for instance on carbon emissions as in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme). Many environmental economists argue that the latter is the most cost-efficient, but policymakers still have to determine a socially optimal level of pollution in order to set the quantity of certificates. If transaction costs between parties are sufficiently low, then the outcome of negotiations between the polluters and the actors suffering the effects of pollution is supposed to be socially optimal, regardless of the initial allocation of property rights (the Coase theorem). Another market failure is the underprovision of public goods: i.e. goods that benefit everybody regardless of their contribution to its provision. Prominent examples are ecosystem conservation and climate change mitigation. Although these measures would benefit everybody, single actors may be unwilling to make the effort for fear that other actors will take a free ride on their efforts and thus gain economic advantage. The problem might be solved by government provision or subsidies to provide the good, but as past climate negotiations illustrate, it is especially difficult to establish this at an international level. Ecological economists are more critical about solving environmental problems by introducing novel markets and privatizing the commons. Not every external effect of a market can be internalized. To do so would entail a never-ending game between market participants and regulators and result in an absurd increase in bureaucracy to control the market. Markets are always embedded in a social context such that social norms and moral issues play an important role in agents\u2019 decisions. Therefore, ecological economists emphasize the co-evolution of market institutions, consumer preferences, and suppliers. Social relations are often more important than economic calculations, which is one of the reasons why the tragedy of the commons often does not occur even without formal institutions or clearly defined property rights. Ecological economists also criticize the strong focus on Pareto-efficient allocation of resources and stress, instead pointing to the importance of a just distribution between societal actors and resilient resource use.Herman E. Daly and Joshua Farley, Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications, 2nd edition. Washington, DC: Island Press, 2011. This is particularly important for the allocation of resources between present and future generations, because the latter hold no property rights in the current system. As this example shows, unequal endowments are important for the market outcome. Even in a market with clearly defined property rights, the rich can degrade the environment at the expense of the poor. The idea of a clear separation between market and state can also be challenged at a fundamental level. Policymakers are increasingly influenced by demands from market actors rather than acting to contain and regulate markets for the common good. Market actors, on the other hand, can be involved in political decisions that influence market structures and rules. Despite the rhetoric of the markets allowing everybody free choice as opposed to governmental despotism, people experience the tyranny of the market. In political terms, the market operates according to the logic of \u201cone dollar = one vote,\u201d such that the poor cannot participate in important decisions mediated through the markets, e.g. with regard to their future as determined by investments in different kinds of energy production. Thus, the mainstream concept of the market as a desirable mechanism that coordinates all participants\u2019 self-interests for the common good is challenged. Teaching Pluralist Economics The divergent views discussed above are rarely reflected in economics education at universities. Instead, economics students are mainly trained in neoclassical economics theory. Environmental economics is often either an optional subject in general economics programs or part of specialized ones that focus on environmental issues. Only a few universities offer courses in ecological economics, for instance at the universities of Vienna and Leeds. Although much of the academic mainstream discussion has moved forward and is now more concerned with exploring the limitations of neoclassical theory, economics curricula devote much time and effort to teaching, cohort after cohort, the basic building blocks of neoclassical economics: perfectly competitive markets, general equilibrium, and homo economicus. One reason for the dominance of neoclassical economics, especially in the curricula, is probably that it provides a consistent framework with a compelling mathematical formalization. However, the dominance of neoclassical thinking in economics curricula comes at a cost: there is only a small share of courses on ethical issues, the methodology and history of economics, and alternative approaches to economics.ISIPE, \u201cInternational Student Initiative on Pluralism in Economics: Survey of economics curricula,\u201d 2016; online http://pepseconomie.wix.com/isipe#!international-survey/ntmte (accessed August 30, 2016). Furthermore, students often are not encouraged to engage critically with the theories presented or to reflect on their historical development. Why is this important? Many economics students of today will go on to advise decision-makers in the future and their education influences how they perceive and frame problems. Thus, the education determines the kind of business or policy advice they will give. But because policies or business practices influence people\u2019s behavior in ways consistent with the theory, this can lead to situations in which reality increasingly resembles economic theory, for better or for worse. Economic sociology has coined the concept \u201cperformativity of economic theory\u201d to explain this phenomenon.Michel Callon (ed.), The Laws of the Markets. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers/The Sociological Review, 1998. However, as the recent financial and economic crises have shown, markets do not always work in the way that the established theories describe. In view of the limitations of mainstream economics, students and heterodox researchers increasingly call for more pluralism in economic research and teaching.ISIPE, \u201cInternational Student Initiative on Pluralism in Economics: An international student call for pluralism in economics,\u201d 2014; online www.isipe.net/open-letter/ (accessed August 30, 2016).\u00a0Pluralist teaching of economics allows students to become acquainted with different schools of economic thought, learn about the strengths and weaknesses of varying approaches, and reflect upon the applied methodologies. This includes economists becoming more aware of the effect their theories can have on the economic system and the normative assumptions that go into them. Of course, it is important to keep up the ideal of separating normative and descriptive statements in economic science. However, economists need to be sensitive to the limitations of this ideal in practice. Finally, ecological and environmental issues should become part of the core economics curriculum. Without awareness of environmental issues in all political and business decisions, a transition toward a sustainable economy\u2014of whatever model, however it may look\u2014will not work. Students ought to be exposed to debates around the relationship of economic and ecological systems, the limitations of market solutions to environmental problems, and the desirability of economic efficiency and growth. Specialized programs that deal with these issues are not enough. We need to fully integrate ecological issues into the teaching of economics and stop treating it as a well-separated subfield. Conclusion In this essay, I have highlighted key points of the economic debate around environmental issues that are prevalent in the Anthropocene discourse.See also Peter G. Brown and Peter Timmermann (eds), Ecological Economics for the Anthropocene: An emerging paradigm. New York: Columbia University Press, 2015. There are a number of diverse economic positions regarding the framing and solution to these problems through environmental governance, but as far as teaching economics is concerned, the mainstream environmental economics view dominates. This is a dangerous one-sidedness because the \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution of increasing financialization and thus more markets, as often proposed by mainstream economists, might not solve ecological problems. Instead, community-based governance structures could be the key to a sustainable economy. In preference to blindly trusting in the effectiveness of governance through markets, their purported self-regulation, and the swarm-intelligence of market participants, economists should be educated to think about where markets are actually beneficial and how to reclaim control over markets that no longer serve sustainable societal goals.",

                "text": "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to eat it to save it\u201d is a popular saying among slow food producers and eaters who work to preserve the biodiversity of native foods and food traditions facing extinction. It is a tried and true method of engagement. There are many rewards and pleasures that come from eating rare and carefully preserved foods. These foods, like the American wild persimmon found in the Midwest, often circulate story and mythology in and of themselves. It behooves us to pay attention not only to these foods for their ecologic significance, but also to the accompanying narratives and from what perspective they are told. There are many hidden hierarchies in these stories that lead to an accumulated homogenization of cultural capital. Like seeds, we pass these stories from one generation to the next by what comes natural to us: our collective practice of cooking and eating. When we consciously eat these foods, we participate in an ideological arc of past, grounded in the present and future. Baked into the idea of \u201ceating it to save it\u201d is the anthropocentric relationship that humans have with biodiversity through breeding and natural selection. As much as the rise and fall of biodiversity on Earth has happened outside the realm of human interaction, the biodiversity of what we call food has very much to do with human interaction. This relationship has been well documented throughout time, and especially here, in the American Bottom\u2014the extensive floodplains of the East St. Louis region. The ongoing work of paleoethnobotanists, whose archeological data goes back some 5,000 years, demonstrates how humans have manipulated plant productivity through seed selection from prehistory to present times.See \u201cField Station 3: Post-natural Landscapes,\u201d https://www.anthropocene-curriculum.org/events/field-station-3-post-natural-landscapes. To understand that history helps us to understand farmland as a kind of cultural landscape where the production of space and human patterns are accumulated and impressed upon the contours of the natural environment,Dolores Hayden, The Power of Place: Urban Landscapes as Public History. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1997. chapter 2, pp. 15. until we can no longer identify what came before the human. We can seek out biological and cultural remnants of prehuman edible matter in any landscape. But the more we look, the more we find ourselves intertwined at every level. This project, Edible Encounters along the Mississippi, used a methodology of enactment and encounter to investigate examples of native biodiversity and foods of significance in the Confluence region. Working with edible matter can be particularly thrilling because it is alive. Like us, plants and seeds and animals are biologically programmed to reproduce. We can attempt to seek this life through an exploration of the landscape in the liminal sidelines of the river, looking for undomesticated, latent, lost, or forgotten examples of what has become wild. As an instructive investigation\u2014on the river, with students\u2014Edible Encounters presented foods linked to place. It used specific assemblages of vegetables, nuts, beans, and other foods as curated objects that were then prepared in a group encounter and transformed into meals that have linkages to histories of place. The foods are intended to be eaten in order to be \u201csaved,\u201d or at least preserved, through a continuity of experience placed in a collective memory. Edible Encounters also pursued relations between food and place in unforeseen encounters with the wild (what still gets called \u201cwilderness\u201d)Cronon William, Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature. New York: W. W. Norton, 1995, pp. 69-90., offering a temporal investigation in what the place has to offer through foraging. Foraging asks us to look in detail at the landscape and ask, \u201cWhat is edible here?\u201d It enables us to seek real time and sometimes fleeting assemblages of edible material. Importantly, it calls upon the capital of knowledge and the currency of culture to know how to recognize the findings and what to do with them. Foraging along the banks of the Mississippi River offers an opportunity to recognize remnants of ecologic autonomy in pockets of wilderness contrasted against the larger surroundings of industry and agricultural monocultures. It allows us to imagine narratives and micro eco-communities that diverge from the vast monocultures and veer from the anthropocenic. If you look at farmland adjacent to the Mississippi River today, you will not be shocked to see that the majority of field crops are contemporary monocultures, like corn and soy. These productive landscapes are the very opposite of biodiversity. In fact, fifteen or so miles of river adjacent to St. Louis and Illinois represents the transfer of so much commodity grain production infrastructure from land to water that it is known as the Agriculture Coast. From here, the grain barges move down the river to distribute their cargo for processing and export. Looking carefully at the places affected by the industrialized river economy, we see a well-worn landscape of urbanism, industry, and monoculture that belies this local industry\u2019s significance at the global scale. The influence of corn in particular is worth lingering on for a moment. As one of the world\u2019s central commodities, corn plays a critical role in global food security today. It is also one of the most quintessential crops within the American identity. This elevated status may relate to the cultural emphasis on corn for the role it played in human settlement and agriculture, as it spread from its origin in Central America throughout North America. In the pre-Columbian city of Cahokia, adjacent to the Mississippi River and along the American Bottom, archaeologists date the adoption of maize at roughly 1000 ce. But it was only in the last century that it grew to become the dominant form of agricultural identity in the Midwest. Edible Encounters gave us an opportunity to observe the contrast between the wild bursts of biodiversity in the marginal areas along the river and the widespread control of nature exemplified by the endless cornfields in this region. These series of edible encounters and territorial mash-ups offered interpretations of foods that have bioregional origins or are part of long-standing Indigenous traditions or both. It was an opportunity to look to Indigenous knowledge, tradition, and creativity to build collective narratives and memory through the shared experience of taste. Like the Mississippi River itself, these encounters paired planning with spontaneity and required participants to go with the flow.",

It hinges on the relationships between cultivated and wild species. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) has achieved global notoriety for its highly nutritious, gluten-free seeds, although not long ago it was largely known as a place-based food domesticated and cultivated in the Andes mountains. It is in the Amaranthaceae family, which developed into various place-based varietals of Chenopodium throughout Central and North America. In fact, its cousin lamb\u2019s quarters (Chenopodium berlandieri and Chenopodium album), which we found growing wild in the forested sand dunes along the Mississippi River, is widely distributed throughout North America and is considered a weed. But it was not always seen as such. Lamb\u2019s quarters is one of the prehistoric crops known as the Eastern Agricultural Complex (EAC), a group of cultivated and domesticated species that supported the agricultural legacy of early peoples in the region. The common sunflower seed (Helianthus annuus) is also part of the EAC and has long been used because of its edible seeds that are rich in oil. It is difficult to know exactly what species commercial pumpkin seeds (genus Cucurbita, possibly Cucurbita argyrosperma) come from. We do know that another gourd relative, Cucurbita pepo, was cultivated as part of the EAC as early as 3,000 years ago. This squash was most likely dried and used as a container. The turkey broth represents the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo and its subspecies), an iconic bird native to North America that has played a significant role in many Indigenous cultures for its meat, eggs, and feathers.",

These are vital crops and feature in the stories and cosmology of many Native American Nations. When planted together, the seeds works together in order to share benefits and thrive. The corn provides poles for the beans to climb up; the beans fix the soil with nitrogen, which benefits the other plants; and the wide leaves of the squash block out sunlight, retaining moisture and minimizing weeds. When cooked together, it is believed that their various enzymes work together to make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins more accessible to the body. Hominy is dried corn that has been nixtamalized, or soaked in an alkaline solution, which helps to dissolve the tough outer skin of the kernel. The kernels are then usually eaten cooked or ground into grits or flour called masa. Both beans and hominy were carefully procured from a small company called Rancho GordoFor more information, see Rancho Gordo\u2019s website at https://www.ranchogordo.com., a heritage bean seller that works with small-scale growers all over the Americas to produce heirloom varieties.",

I had brought with me several squash that had been grown and harvested at the Cahokia interpretive garden in the summer. Traditionally, people would slice the squash and hang it to dry to save it for the winter.

Fritz mentions how Cahokians were skilled in obtaining and processing tree nuts like hickory, acorn, and hazelnut.Ibid. Hickory nuts were abundant in the Eastern Agriculture Complex, although the trees are no longer as abundant in this region as they once were. Cherokee today continue to make kunuche, a hickory-nut soup that begins with a laborious process of cracking and pounding the nuts and then forming the resulting paste into a ball for storage. When it is time to make the soup, the ball is dissolved in hot water, the shell fragments are picked out, and various other ingredients are added, such as rice, hominy, sugar, and salt. We wanted to attempt to reenact this process on the river. However, I was not able to obtain a large enough amount of hickory nuts, so instead I was able to locally source a significant amount of American hazelnut (Corylus americana). We river travelers toasted the nuts over an open fire, pounded them to release the nuts from their shells, and sampled them. From a larger batch of already shelled hazelnuts, we pounded out a coarse meal, to which we added water and then placed over an open campfire. As the nuts boiled, diced apples (Malus pumila) were added along with big spoonfuls of dough, which turned into puffy cornmeal dumplings\u2014made primarily from stone-ground cornmeal from the historic Weisenberger Mill in Kentucky. The primary inspiration of the rice dish was the wild grape. Missouri is home to both cultivated and wild native grape species (Vitis labrusca and Vitis riparia). On our river journey, we found abundant wild grape vines along the shores of the Mississippi, but, in early October, there were no grapes left on the vine. However, the leaves were collected and boiled in salted water, making them tender and releasing a surprising sour, tangy taste. The boiled leaves were added to a Middle Eastern\u2013themed pilaf of rice, raisins, and fried onions. This meal was an attempt to enact the seasonal processing of hickory nuts, which has been vital to the nutrition of the Indigenous Peoples of this region as far back as the Late Paleoindian period (over 10,000 years ago). Fritz writes, \u201cThe fact that this food (Kunuche balls) is still made and consumed by many Cherokee people today says a great deal about persistence of native values and appreciation of long-standing traditions.\u201dGayle Fritz, \u201cEthnobotany of Ku-Nu-Che: Cherokee Hickory Nut Soup,\u201d Journal of Ethnobiology, vol. 21, no. 2 (Winter 2001): p. 3.This type of Traditional Knowledge is kept alive when traditions such as kunuche making are intently enacted and performed. Our use of the also locally available hazelnuts is an interesting substitute, and it brings to question why hickory nuts have a preferential relationship with Indigenous traditions over hazelnuts. Both are tree nuts and both were prolific in the region for thousands of years. Because of trees\u2019 perennial rootedness in the land, I suggest that tree nuts have more long-standing agency in the landscape than any annual crop, like corn, which relies on humans to harvest and save and replant the seeds.",

The contrast between the Mississippi River, its floodplain, and the adjacent fields provides one such liminal landscape to ponder human life along the river, from days long ago up until now.

Scientists can look at the stratigraphy of rock record and ascertain a great wealth of information about the history of our planet, but any single outcrop or section of layers will not tell the complete story. Subtle nuances and great unconformities exist between the rocks from one location to the next. Never discouraged, geologists at the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) have managed to come together and agree on distinguishable boundaries to differentiate geologic periods, epochs, and ages. The reference boundary is referred to as the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point or GSSP. This point and associated stratigraphy is what becomes globally recognized as the lower marker of a given geologic time division. In the dynamic times that we live in, the planet has been rapidly transformed by human activity. These changes are significant enough that the people tasked with studying the layers of the earth\u2014the ICS and the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS)\u2014created a working group to debate whether these changes signify the boundary of a new geologic time period: the Anthropocene.

At a previous gathering of the AWG in 2016, the majority of attendees (88 percent) voted that the Anthropocene is stratigraphically real at the magnitude of an epoch and best represented by the atomic radiation spikes found globally in stratigraphic records from the early 1950s and 1960s. In particular, the presence of plutonium-239 following atmospheric bomb testing around 1952 seems to be the most globally recognizable primary marker and is favored by the group. Bomb testing during this time propelled radioactive dust high into the upper atmosphere, allowing it to settle back down virtually everywhere on the planet. The 1952 date for the Anthropocene is actively met with contention from at least one landscape ecologist in attendance of the 2019 AWG meeting, outspoken in his views on such a \u201clate\u201d date for the start of the Anthropocene. Indeed, there are many other stratigraphic markers dated long before the plutonium-239\u2014such as evidence of human agricultural activity in the soil record\u2014that could also be used as indicators of the Anthropocene. However, the geochronological basis for the GSSP was decided by majority vote in 2016 and so the debate is secondary to the current work of the group deciding the most representative candidate site for the Anthropocene.

The AWG works in partner with two German institutions, the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt, that will be able to offer some support to assist with research at the chosen candidate site and establish the formal stratigraphic boundary of the Anthropocene. There are a variety of localities being considered as potential GSSP candidate sites for the Anthropocene, and the AWG is actively soliciting nominations. The primary requirement is that the location clearly captures plutonium-239 in a reliable stratigraphic sequence, though an additional requirement is the existence of prior research data. Candidate sites can be soil sections from bays, reservoirs, lakes, seas, and peat bogs, as well as other stratigraphic sequences like cores from ice, trees, speleothems, and coral.",

Many consider the presence of microplastics, concrete, and other novel materials in the sediment as an indicator of the Anthropocene that predates the primary plutonium-239 marker. Likewise, concepts such as the spread of invasive species and the presence of soot from the burning of coal also make good secondary markers of the Anthropocene. The main issues with using these as primary markers are that they are not globally present in the sediment record and do not offer as precise of a geochronological timer as plutonium-239. Each potential record source has drawbacks and redeeming qualities. For example, cores from ice, coral, trees, and speleothems are unlikely to contain any novel materials but they are all relatively stable. A living organism has never before been used as a GSSP, so coral and trees would be unprecedented. Sediment records from bogs, bays, lakes, reservoirs, and seas hold great potential but they are not yet lithified (hardened into rock) and thus are difficult to sample while prone to loss, compaction, and distortion. The inherent stability associated with GSSPs in the rock record is not as certain when considering unconsolidated strata.",

                "text": "Uncertainty The uncertainty involved with selecting a GSSP for the Anthropocene extends beyond the drawbacks of candidate sites. While plutonium-239 offers an ideal layer to make as the base of stratigraphy for the Anthropocene, there is plenty of evidence that humans were impacting the sediment record far earlier than 1952. In addition, we cannot know the extent to which we will change the planet and the sediment record in the near future. In 500 years, geologists might be tempted to look back and decide that another major event serves as a truer marker of the Anthropocene. Fortunately, there is a mechanism that is built into the concept of geologic time that could allow for a more honest representation of the beginning of the Anthropocene\u2014that of uncertainty. If we are using plutonium-239 as the marker of Anthropocene\u2019s onset, the temptation might be to make the date November 2, 1952 and the set uncertainty of this date to 1 week or so (the amount of time it took for the radioactive dust from Ivy Mike to have global reach). If we instead acknowledge that there are indicators in the sediment record far older than this date, we can honor the gradual transition into the atomic Anthropocene with the 1952 date but an uncertainty of 200 years. This would then cover the mass adoption of the Watt steam engine in the late 1700s, the Industrial Revolution, the introduction of most invasive species, and the vast majority of fossil fuel emissions. It also offers a buffer for the uncertainty of the future and acknowledges the complexity of the issue under debate.",

It\u2019s a great time to be a Quaternary geologist, and an even better time to be an anthropomorphic organism; this is our time! The formal recognition and boundary for the Anthropocene will not fundamentally change what the Anthropocene is socially. The term has been adopted by all reaches of culture and has taken on a meaning of its own. However, a formal geologic recognition would influence geologists, archeologists, anthropologists, and other soil scientists. Scientific literature would become consistent in the temporal definition of the boundary.

Historically, environments have been increasingly made with the help of technologies. Closed spatial arrangements like botanical gardens, polar stations, clean rooms, air raid shelters or space colonies provide certain living conditions that are shaped and maintained by technology. Large technical systems of settlement, sewage and transport, farming and mining, waste management and warfare transform vast regions. Infrastructures of environmental monitoring, observation and regulation encompass entire planets. Over the course of the 20th century and up to the present, technoscientific environmental interventions and their consequences have become ever more vast and more persistent and have colonized ever larger spaces and timeframes. There are also technologies that work with our understanding of the environment. A compelling recent example is remote sensing imagery, but similar work was done in earlier historical eras by landscape painting and photography. Likewise temperature measurements, rules on how to appropriate a commons or manage a national park, economic theory or statistics work with our understanding of the environment. Thus environing technologies can be understood as those technologies that on the one hand directly reshape nature into environment in some form, and on the other hand show us nature in a specific way and thereby limit or expand our idea of what we can achieve with and in nature. The Environing Technology seminar of the Anthropocene Campus applies this concept to various cases of environment-technology interaction and co-creation.",

What does it mean to create environments with earth-like qualities on Earth and beyond? Studying the different functions they need to fulfil, which kinds of environments are created, and for whom? And how do these environments reflect back on the largest technogarden, Earth itself? Satellite sublime Nina Wormbs Climate change is hard to fathom. Graphs can sometimes condensate global numbers and pictures of climate events are often used. Satellite mosaics lie inbetween these two types of climate change communication. With their distance, perspective and scale these images can be sorted under the sublime. Satellite imagery is a environing technology and in this talk we explore a few examples. Satellite sensing and environmental management Johan G\u00e4rdebo Satellites environ the earth in two ways: first by encircling it with orbits and second by continuously sensing its surface. This makes it practicable for users of satellites to speak about environments globally. Satellite sensing is thus part of the history of the global environment as understood in its particularities: the practices, places, and projects that environ the Earth. This talk focuses on how Swedish consultancy firms, aid organizations, and technology companies sought to promote satellite sensing to developing countries as a tool for environmental management. Nuclear environments Karena Kalmbach The application of nuclear technologies has altered and will alter environments around the globe: weapons test sites, polluted plant facilities, irradiated landscapes caused by accidents, and waste storage sites have created nuclear environments which are governed by sensing, measuring and restricting. The technical control of these places, made necessary by technology use, is at the same time counteracted by environmental realities: birds and fishes do not obey the demarcation lines of restricted zones, neither do winds and water currents that carry radioactive particles. Thus the human utopia of being able to control the technological realities is largely based on ignorance of environment-technology interaction. Fieldwork at a distance Etienne Benson Environmental scientists increasingly use technologies of remote sensing and telecommunications to study the natural world at a distance. A range of environments are re-fashioned and re-imagined through such practices, including the environment of the office or laboratory where the scientist receives and interprets data, the environment of the sensor or satellite infrastructure that gathers and transmits the data, and the environment(s) to which the data. With examples drawn from the history of ecology and geology, this lecture explores environmental scientists\u2019 changing relationships to the field and fieldwork in light of these envirotechnical possibilities.",

                "text": "River sediments consist of particles of various grain sizes that originate from erosion and weathering of rocks in catchment areas. Their flow is responsible for both the accumulation and transport of sediments from inland areas through estuaries or deltas to the oceans. Thus, river sediments (also referred to as fluvial sediments) occur as a material deposited on the bottom of riverbeds, suspended in water or transported by water currents. Each catchment is unique in terms of its sources and in the types of sediments and processes that affect the mineralogical and chemical composition of the river sediments. Human activity can have a profound impact on sedimentation rates and on the pollution of river sediments, especially in densely populated, urbanized regions. Increased erosion rates caused by intensified land use in catchment, as a result of mining and mineral processing, deforestation or agriculture, for example, may restrict sediment transport because of excessive sediment loads. Another direct impact on sediment fluxes is caused by river engineering works such as dredging, river embankment or dam and levee construction. Concentrations of pollutants are much higher in sediments than in the water flowing above. Water-sediment interactions are critical to the chemical composition of the river sediments. Pollution of river sediments is mainly caused by the precipitation of pollutants from water under appropriate thermodynamic conditions and by sorption of pollutants on the sediment particles. \u00a0Grain size distribution is an important factor affecting this process, in particular the ability of sediments to adsorb pollutants. Sediments with a higher content of fine grains are more effective in sorption than coarsely grained sediments because of a higher surface charge and a higher surface area to volume ratio. The hydrological regime in the catchment is another factor that changes the chemical composition of river sediments. Flood events can remobilize pollutants, introducing historically contaminated sediments into flowing river water. Concentrations of pollutants and suspended particles increase as river discharge increases, and usually become stabilized as the flood diminishes. Sediment samples collected during lower water stages are enriched in trace elements and nutrients compared to samples collected during flood events. Factors and processes that control the chemical composition of river sediments are summarized in Fig. 1. Rivers are characterized by a constant flow of water. In contrast to lakes and seas, sedimentary sequences in rivers are usually poorly preserved because the sediments are constantly removed by the flowing waters. However, collecting samples in areas where water flow is reduced (e.g. in estuaries, or on river banks) or on floodplains, makes it possible to reconstruct the past environmental conditions within a catchment area and to use this knowledge in the study of the Anthropocene. The history of human impact on rivers is recorded in their sediments. By studying the mineralogical and chemical composition of dated sediment layers, it is possible to \u00a0make readable changes to environmental and anthropogenic factors that influenced the catchment area in the past. For this reason, undisturbed river sediments are regarded as excellent archives of environmental history.",

The transport of sediments by river is disturbed in the heavily engineered drainage networks associated with the world\u2019s largest rivers. For example, in the Mississippi River catchment, the construction of dams has reduced the annual fluxes of sediments to the Gulf of Mexico up to 70%  Horowitz, A.J., \u201cA quarter century of declining suspended sediment fluxes in the Mississippi River and the effect of the 1993 flood,\u201d Hydrologi\u00adcal Processes, v. 24 (2010) p. 13\u201334  . Terrigenous sediments are transported by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, where they are deposited on the continental shelf as an important source of organic carbon and nutrients in the marine coastal environment. Typical constituents of river sediments that are determined when reconstructing human impact on the environment in the catchment areas are: trace elements, nutrient elements, radionuclides, persistent organic pollutants, and, more recently, microplastics. Sediments of the rivers flowing through large cities are usually characterized by an enrichment of trace metals, especially cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, and zinc. Fallout radionuclides, such as 137Cs and 210Pb that accumulated in river sediments as a result of nuclear weapon testing are often used to determine where sediment came from, its age, and residence time. Fallout radionuclides have also been proposed as markers of the starting date of the Anthropocene. In addition to trace metals river sediments in urban areas also show increased levels of a variety of organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and other compounds. Most of the organic compounds are hydrophobic, which makes them especially prone to accumulation in sediments. Sediments in catchments that host intensiveagricultural activities are enriched in pesticides and nutrient elements, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The latter, if present in excessive amounts in river water, causes eutrophication and can be adsorbed onto sediment particles. A number of different pollution sources are critical when it comes to determining the environmental geochemistry of river sediments, including mining and mineral processing, wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents, and storm/flood water discharge. Metal-ore mining, meanwhile, causes the accumulation of metals and metalloids (mostly arsenic) in river sediments. Alongside this, artisanal and small-scale gold mining, in which elemental mercury is applied to form a Hg-gold amalgam, counts among the largest anthropogenic sources of mercury in the environment. Wastewater treatment plants contribute to pollution of river waters and subsequently, river sediments, mostly with nutrient elements and microplastics (with microfibers being a predominant category). A significant source of particle-bound metals and organic compounds that pollutes river sediments in densely-populated areas is a road runoff. In some cases, the accumulation of pollutants in river sediments may only be temporary. This is because pollutants can undergo transformation, desorption or volatilization. Some of these processes are microbially-mediated, for example, the methylation of inorganic mercury to more toxic methylmercury and dimethylmercury, or the biodegradation of organic compounds. Microbial methylation is a very common phenomenon, especially in organic-rich and oxygen-depleted sediments. Pollutants in suspended sediments may also be taken up by bottom-living animals and may enter biogeochemical cycles. Different geochemical tracers can be used for determining river sediment provenance. The most popular tracers include major and biogenic elements, rare earth elements, trace elements (e.g., As, C, Cu, Pb, Zn) and elemental ratios (e.g., Si/Al, Pb/Al, Cu/Pb), fallout radioisotopes (e.g., 7Be, 137Cs, 210Pb, 239,240Pu), and stable isotopes (e.g., \u03b413C, \u03b415N, \u03b487Sr). The use of geochemical tracers in studies of the sources of sediments and sources of sediment pollutants is referred to as geochemical fingerprinting. The chemical composition of river sediments also depends also many natural factors, including lithology, mineralogy, weathering potential of rocks in the catchment area, temperature, water pH, dissolved oxygen, content of organic matter, precipitation, river channel geometry, and bioturbation. All should be taken into account when it comes to interpreting results of studies on the chemical composition of river sediment samples. The human impact on environmental geochemistry of river sediments is multifaceted, which makes the study of such impacts complex, and rarely able to produce straightforward answers.",

                "text": "Modern disciplines are organized around orientations to particular spheres and zones of life. However, based on the ecologies of practices they enlist, disciplines can also be thought of as particular ways of being affected. If, following Brian Massumi, we accept that affect is as much about a capacity to be affected as it is a capacity to affect and act in return, this poses larger, global questions when considering affect as a proposition for an anthropocenic re-assembling of disciplinary boundaries. What would a reframing of discipline offer our performance of research in a planetary context, in which being affected is an urgent political and ethical condition? The question: \u201cWhat is the Anthropocene?\u201d is still an unanswerable one. Despite the array of proposals for various \u201cmarkers\u201d for this geologic epoch\u2014from traces of Strontium 90 to the topographical stamps of plantations\u2014there is doubt about our capacity to adequately define this era, and its relation to planetary history. However, the Anthropocene certainly affects our practices as scholars, thinkers, and sentient beings. It forces us to reconsider our notions of time, nature, work, and the human. The demands of the Anthropocene do not operate only at the level of research presentation, but clash in the liminal realm of methods, devices, and concepts. In many ways, the Anthropocene does more than just resist our categorizations: it addresses what we mean by knowing, and enrolls us as cognizant beings in a world of multiple ontologies that exceed the human. We suggest that this blur should be taken as an opportunity: if we cannot \u201caddress the Anthropocene\u201d\u2014in the way that modern disciplines hoped to address objects situated in the world\u2014we must at least explore its contours. We begin, here, by paying attention to the ways in which the Anthropocene affects us. We prioritize the ways it moves us and demands our attention; we remain open to the questions it poses to our established convictions. Here, our ambition is not to define the Anthropocene, nor to affix its boundaries as an object of research. Rather, we propose a reinvigoration of experimental, creative practices as privileged processes of knowing, and a \u201cfollowing\u201d of materials that multiplies the repertoires in which we can speak about life in the Anthropocene. Crucially, our attention to creative experiments is an endeavor to revive experimentation as an open source ecological practice, and to equate it with experience once again. The separation of experience from experiment was a project of the Enlightenment, one that sought to strip the mythology of the personal (subjective) from the rational order and canon of scientific knowledge. Here, in parallel with an emergent hegemony of rational thought, an epistemological weight was ascribed to experiment stripped of its subjective character\u2014and thus denied its ability to respond to those experiential elements not yet quantifiable or describable by the language of logic.Raymond Williams, Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1976, pp. 115\u201217. Within this movement, the \u201cexperiment\u201d came to stand for first-order, observable, or reproducible qualia, with experience relegated to the position of secondary, internal, or subjective qualia. The experiment has come to be equated with a kind of secluded ritual space, with specific properties that circumscribe the scope of \u201cvalid\u201d knowledge, and root it in multiple forms of violence. This violence is notably one of the methods\u2014an obligated, unitary access to the world, brandished against all others which are doomed for elimination.Isabelle Stengers, \u201cWondering about materialism,\u201d in: Levy Bryant et al. (eds),\u00a0The Speculative Turn: Continental materialism and realism. Melbourne: re.press, 2011, pp. 368\u201280. It is also the violence of the current process of writing, in response to research calls and proposals, with its attendant need for ethical protocols, risk assessment, pre-framing of methods, well-defined objects, boundaries of fieldwork, and expected results. However, similar difficulties can also be encountered in a phenomenological approach that adopts experience as the category of establishing knowledge; this approach ignores the subtleties of difference and fails to nuance the complex ways in which people experience their environments.Robert Desjarlais, Shelter Blues. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997. Subjective experience\u2014while always historically and culturally situated\u2014informs knowledge production. As such, it intersects with the realm of objective knowledge. Subjective qualia cannot be cleanly segregated from the seemingly \u201cobjective\u201d first-order qualia. The creative experiments compelled by the Anthropocene are not those that would codify processes and events such that they can be replicated in particular assemblages, ready to be reconstructed; as such practices risk denying us the possibility of being affected by the experiment. What we mean by experiment has a different tenor: experimentation as that which places knowledge at risk, questions what we know and how we know it, and seeks to reinstate knowledge as grounded in subjective, self-reflexive, and transforming practices. Creative experiments are careful, exploratory engagements through which we follow, act, react, record, and trace the often-messy material convergences of concept, matter, and energy in the universe. Knowledge is in and of the world. To recognize this is to expose our knowledge to change or challenge. It is to be open to the unexpected, to accidents and coincidences, to \u201cembrace failure,\u201dErin Manning and Brian Massumi, Thought in the Act: Passages in the ecology of experience. Minneapolis, MN, and London: University of Minnesota Press, 2014. and to welcome serendipity. In creative experiments, knowledge is not the result, but that which is generated along the experimental process. In the History of Modern Fact, Mary Poovey demonstrates that paying attention to the process of fact-creation allows one to critically reflect on knowledge itself.Mary Poovey, History of Modern Fact: Problems of knowledge in the sciences of wealth and society. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1998. Knowledge is not viewed here as a discrete category, but as one that constantly intersects with its specific epistemological frames and thought traditions. Creative experiments must embrace this trait by accounting for the unfolding processes inherent to objects of research. We propose inquiries that make, assemble, grow, and curate in ways that cannot be assessed in pre-established outputs: the processes of these experiments\u2019 unruly deployment \u201cchange[s] the end in changing the means.\u201dBruno Latour, \u201cMorality and technology: The end of the means,\u201d Theory, Culture and Society, vol. 19, nos 5/6 (2002): pp. 247\u201260, p. 252. By beginning with the Anthropocene, and how it affects us and demands a reformulation for understanding and studying it, we find ourselves proposing \u201ccreative experiments\u201d: a material play-cum-experimentation that attends to and follows the movements and ontologies that emerge at the level of experience. This is our opportunity to reconcile experience with experiment, to re-insert \u201cvalue\u201d into the experiential as a way of understanding and thinking about materials. Importantly, the experimental trajectory of material play is never predetermined by the \u201calready-givens\u201d of material science. This is not to suggest that material play blinds itself to empirical data or the mechanics of scientific experimentation; rather, these scientific givens offer up a set of conditions through which such play might emerge. Here, the endless treatise, methodologies, and theoretical data with which scientific experimentation has gifted us exist as invitations; as nominative thresholds to be tested, probed, and manipulated through a playful interaction with materials, which seek to link that empirical data with an experiential knowledge\u2014embodied, intuited, unfolding. What is offered is the experimental possibility of bringing together first- and second-order qualia at the level of enquiry, and a re-formulation of objects and method, such that each communicates the same thing, through the condition of raw experience. Feeling/Following Given the difficulties that the Anthropocene poses, we propose the creative experiment as a process of discovery. At its heart lies a radical openness that makes it possible for the researcher to engage with his or her chosen object of study without being bound-up in and limited by pre-established grids of knowledge. In this section, we draw from Henri Bergson to help articulate the nuanced ways in which we, as researchers, hope to creatively experiment with the Anthropocene. In Matter and Memory (2004), Bergson argues that a purely rational reading of material and space limits us only to the realm of what is already known. Our normative reading of material and space is subtractive: from the wealth of information, movement, and change given in and of our milieu and relations, we tend to extract only those elements of which we estimate that we can make some functional use.Henri Bergson, Matter and Memory, tr. N. M. Paul and W. S. Palmer. New York: Dover Publications, 2004, p. 30. To overcome these dominant narratives\u2014that is, to shift beyond the limits of a purely logical and linear reading of materials and milieu\u2014requires a twist in our perceptual frames and devices, such that we are able to attend to something other. For Bergson, the primary method of attuning and attending to this otherness was his concept of intuition, which he attempted to elevate to the level of scientific method by gifting intuition its own precise methodology.Bergson, Henri,\u00a0The Creative Mind: An introduction to metaphysics, tr. M. L. Andison. New York, NY: Dover Books, 2007, p. 20; Gilles Deleuze,Bergsonism. New York, NY: Zone Books, 1991, p. 13. Here, intuition as a method broadly asks for a process of thinking and attending which is located in the flow and rhythm of duration\u2014that is, in the subjective experience of the passage of time. It is here, by attending to the internal rhythm of one\u2019s own duration, that Bergson claims we are able to move outward, and seek a sympathetic resonance with the rhythm of the objects, materials, and elements surrounding us. This sympathetic durational resonance is at the heart of an intuitive understanding of matter and material. It is here, also, that we might locate a different basis for perceptual selection and reification in creative experiments and material play, guided by intuitive resonance rather than by utility or habit. Importantly, an intuitive understanding of material is underwritten by the condition of primary, sensory experience: experience as it happens, experience prior to logical codification, experience as it emerges in the passage of time. Creative experiments and material play thus require a different kind of attention, one that moves beyond the filters normatively imposed on one\u2019s perceptual framework by the hegemonic tropes of linearity, utility, and habit. This kind of creative play both enables and requires a shift in perceptual hierarchies, such that we can attend equally to the minor and the peripheral, the occluded and the \u201cuseless,\u201d the mutating and the fleeting. In breaking with these filters\u2014in attending to an excluded otherness\u2014we are able to open onto possibilities for experimentation that are guided by intuition, sensation, and experience. We are able to draw from the realm of the \u201cunknown.\u201d Creative experiments, for us, are fundamentally about feeling and\u00a0following\u00a0materials. Embedded in this logic is our conviction that the Anthropocene obliges us to think of knowledge without the schema of traditional disciplinary frameworks: it invites us to invent different\u00a0ad hoc\u00a0disciplinary paths and diagrams, to multiply them, to follow new or ancient grains in the textures of thought. This, to us, is less a methodology than a procedure of discovery. We take inspiration from what makers and artisans have always done: splitting timber, for instance, \u201cis a question of surrendering to the wood and following where it leads.\u201dGilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus. New York, NY: Zone Books, 2004, p. 451. As Tim Ingold argues, to describe the properties of things in a processual world is to describe their stories as they flow and metamorphose.Tim Ingold, \u201cMaterials against materiality,\u201d Archaeological Dialogues, vol. 14, no. 1 (2007): pp. 1\u201216. Breaking with \u201cmethods\u201d whose aim is to purify phenomena by isolating them from \u201cbackground noise,\u201d following is to embark on a quest through the Anthropocene in its open-ended multiplicity. To follow the opacity and obduracy of the Anthropocene, we must let it initiate its own terms of enquiry. Following anthropocenic materials will lead us into terrains where we find contradictions. Rather than trying to resolve these, creative experimentation and material play identifies the shifting contours within which the Anthropocene is made explicit. \u201cFollowing,\u201d as an orientation for research, is also resonant with the ethos of Isabelle Stengers\u2019 metaphor of the \u201csolitary hunter.\u201d According to Stengers, the solitary hunter \u201ctakes his time\u201d; the art of the solitary hunt is \u201cempathy.\u201dIsabelle Stengers, Power and Invention: Situating Science. Minneapolis. MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. The German word for \u201cempathy\u201d\u2014Einf\u00fchlung\u2014 translates directly as \u201cfeeling into.\u201d Without taking too many liberties with Stengers, we read \u201cthe art of [feeling into]\u201d as a negotiation between the pull of the one followed, and the acuity of the one following. The task of the hunter/huntress is to suspend his or her own logic in order to be radically open to the logic of the \u201cprey.\u201d This meaning of feeling/ following articulates our methodological affinity for research that is as much about apprehending the trajectory of specific concepts (e.g. kinds of pain, or affective atmospheres) as it is about tracing the many impressions of these concepts in a \u201cmilieu,\u201d or \u201cfield.\u201d An empathic practice of \u201cfeeling into\u201d requires a shift in the understanding of our roles as researchers, and of what is possible within these roles. To find ourselves thoroughly immersed in spaces of dense relations to carry out research\u2014spaces that are at once concrete and enigmatic\u2014is to trace sequences of material impressions through radically interdisciplinary landscapes.   As in Stengers\u2019 metaphor of the hunt, following is not a\u00a0static\u00a0logic but an\u00a0athletic one. It is not a passive engagement, but an ontological commitment to allow oneself to be affected by threads that reach far beyond one\u2019s \u201chome\u201d discipline. This notion of collaboration with materials, therefore, works to reconstitute disciplinary zones, even to abolish entirely the gaps between them, instead tracing various filaments across fields of study.",

In the early 20th century, when weather forecasts began to share media space with economic digests, even the economy took on the language of weather forecasts and began to be described in terms such as \u201ceconomic barometers.\u201d The fundamental structures of society began to act like the weather; they too were liable to depressions and tempests. My intention here is not to make a forecast but to understand the process of forecasting itself. This means understanding how futures emerge and pass away, how they are discarded, mobilized, distributed, and enacted in the present. The future, in this sense, is not self-evidently given but is something that is brought into being; something that is achieved.",

There has been much work in geography and anthropology dedicated to understanding the social function and production of the future.I\u2019m thinking of some of the classic works, including but not limited to, Paul Edwards,\u00a0A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming\u00a0(Cambridge: MIT Press, 2010), Brian Massumi\u00a0Ontopower: War, Powers, and the State of Perception\u00a0(Durham: Duke University Press, 2015), Louise Amoore,\u00a0The Politics of Possibility: Risk and Security Beyond Probability (Durham: Duke University Press, 2013). This work has allowed us to conceive of the ways in which particular futures are mobilized to govern people and space, to pit certain groups against others, to foreclose\u2014and even extinguish\u2014alternative political imaginaries. The mobilization and politicization of the future operates also on relationships between society and nature. Dangerous, risky, and vulnerable futures are galvanized in relationship to unpredictable and volatile environments in ways that pressurize, speed up, or intensify particular social relations.On volatile soils and property in Mexico city, see Seth Denizen \u201cBaroque Soil: Mexico City in the Aftermath\u201d, on the geopolitics of managing calderas, see Amy Donovan \u201cPolitics of the Lively Geos: Volcanism and Geomancy in Korea,\u201d both in Political Geology: Active Stratigraphies and the Making of Life (Switzerland: Palgrave, 2018). Think of how populations have been forcibly transmigrated away from volcanoes in Indonesia, or urban floods have been used as excuses to demolish slums in Jakarta. The history of urban housing and property insurance industries cannot be understood without accounting for the long histories of urban conflagrations in cities such as London or New York. Those cities were dense accumulations of wood, stone, fibers, and open flame that frequently burned and, because of this, gave rise to vast industries that broker futures with the material of cities. Thinking about how the future is political and material in this way has allowed us to understand more broadly how there is never just one future on the social scene but a dense ecology of them vying for attention, coming into being and passing away. But there is one thing that has been frequently overlooked in this work: the center of the earth. Those of us interested in the social and political function of the future can energize a discussion around cosmology and cosmogony.",

                "text": "Centering the Earth and the Earth\u2019s Center On volcanoes, or coastlines disappearing under rising sea levels, and at the edge of earthquake cracks and the muddy grounds of landslides, there is obviously an intense relationship between the necessity of forecasting and the need to understand the earth itself. Pressing cosmological problems emerge around the makeup of the earth\u2014its interior, origins, contingency or lawfulness. It is pressing because there are social demands to know what the future holds and these require an engagement with the meaning and make-up of the earth. Nature forecasting at these sites of high levels of uncertainty is a way of doing cosmology because it demands an account of the structure and causes of how the earth works. But more than this, nature forecasting in these circumstances is also a way of building cosmologies into the world, making them material and giving them form. Cosmologies make worlds in their own image. They are not just interpretations of the world or ideas projected onto the world. The cosmology that states that mantle convection determines crustal movement, the shape of continents, earthquakes and volcanoes, is a product of modern earth sciences, and modern earth sciences are the product of the spaces made by global networks of instruments and laboratories. This is the modern cosmology of the earth, our myth of earth, that is enacted in space in these networks, laboratories and instruments. Forecasting earthquakes, eruptions, and tsunamis, then, becomes material performance of the cosmology of plate tectonics and a means of testing it in the world.Deborah Coen,\u00a0The Earthquake Observers: Disaster Science from Lisbon to Richter\u00a0(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013). For a study of scientists making sense of seimographs and shamans making their own geophysical instruments, my dissertation about Mount Merapi at\u00a0Cultures of Forecasting: Volatile and Vulnerable Nature, Knowledge and the Future of Uncertainty. In other words, forecasting becomes a way of testing the veridiction of a cosmology. Cosmologies are models of the earth that are built and extended in real space and transform the earth into their own image. Landscapes, then, are these built models made inhabitable and lived in. The reason that it is important for those of us interested in understanding forecasting to foreground cosmological and cosmogenic questions is because it allows us to dig deeper into the conditions that make particular futures possible and how the time of nature is lived socially. Modernist geology, as historians of geology tell the story, was born of a cosmology that struggled with its Judeo-Christian, monotheist inheritance, and produced not only the astonishing deep past but also the deep future\u2014an earth that will outlast human inhabitation and that was not made for us.Martin Rudwick,\u00a0World\u2019s Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2008); Martin Rudwick,\u00a0Earth\u2019s Deep History: How It Was Discovered and Why it Matters (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2008). This \u201cdisenchanted\u201d modernist future is inseparable from a conception of earth and planetary structure developed in the European and American high imperial and colonial periods and of which the Anthropocene designation is the most recent instance of this geological cosmology.",

This also means taking seriously the multiplicity of cosmologies that haven\u2019t been \u201cmodernized,\u201d or otherwise subverted, escaped, or hybridized with contested cosmologies. We can begin to understand how the earth\u2019s futures differ according to the cosmological understanding of what, how, and why it is made. This has consequences for the kinds of political futures we can imagine. We can imagine that multiple futures of the earth\u2014not only deep time\u2014have emerged, been tested, and put into circulation. And because of this, we can also begin to understand how those different futures have forged different kinds of politics and relationships between society and nature. The future of nature, then, is a cosmological question. Before making claims about what the future of nature will be, I suggest that we undertake the cosmological work on the make-up of earth itself, its origins, and how multiple cosmologies interact as ideas, architectures, and materials in space. This of course also means avoiding the tropes of modernist comparative cosmologies which often imagined that cosmological systems were stable, with defined edges, and without history. Instead, it is a problem of cosmologies in motion and encounter, of space and matter, folded and enfolding. They carve out and test futures of the earth, place the earth under our feet, make sense of its shuddering and displacement. They multiply the earth and its futures.",

It was built in 1820 by the U.S. Army to serve as a vantage point for monitoring threats to American interests in the fur trade. During autumn 2019, the Minnesota Historical Society (MHS) began construction of a $34.5 revitalization project guided by a vision statement titled \u201cMany stories\u2014still untold.\u201d Many questions are on my mind about Fort Snelling\u2019s \u201crevitalization.\u201d What does it mean to tell stories about a place that doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s yours? Who gets to write and tell those \u201cstill untold\u201d stories? How will the Historical Society determine which stories are the ones that need to be told in the here and now? And, as a site of important ecological as well as cultural relevance, how might those stories go \u201ddeep time\u201d and open up new vantage points on the site and its intertwined physical, material, and social histories. Writing a deep time story of Fort Snelling is an unenviable challenge. There are clear stakes in telling some stories, and not others, as well as telling stories in one way rather than another. At the same time, Fort Snelling is a place so steeped in painful histories that it feels like only some people should have license to tell its stories; its Dakota stories, its black slave stories, its military stories. Yet, it is also one of our most public places, where families and schoolchildren come daily to learn about Minnesota\u2019s early history\u2014nearly everyone in Minnesota knows where Fort Snelling is and what they think it is all about. I encounter Fort Snelling intimately and regularly. I bicycle near it on the river parkway. I glance puzzlingly at the stone tower nearly every time I cross the Highway 5 Fort Road Bridge over the Mississippi driving west. I hike through the Fort to cross the bridge that leads to Pike Island so I can pause at the confluence. Because of its everyday presence in my own life, I need to be reminded of its importance as a site of political conflagration over how we remember and reckon with to whom it belongs. I also never know where to start when I use stories to encapsulate the history of this place to my students, neighbors, friends, and family. For example, take the story of the Wagon Train protest. In 2008, a Minnesota Statehood Sesquicentennial Wagon Train rolled its way toward Fort Snelling as part of a 100-mile, week long\u00a0 journey. In all, eighty-five people in period dress traveled by horseback in covered wagons, buggies, surreys, and one stagecoach. When they reached Fort Snelling, they were met with indigenous protestors who were drumming, burning sage, and carrying signs that read: \u201cI am not invisible.\u201d Some protesters laid on the ground in front of a squad car with a pair of signs reading: \u201cIf we get in your way\u201d \u2026 \u201cWill you kill us again?\u201d Eventually, 13 different law enforcement vehicles arrived on the scene to carry away the disruptors.Russell, Scott, and TC Daily Planet. \u201cDakota Protesters Meet Sesquicentennial Wagon Train.\u201d Twin Cities Daily Planet, Dec 25, 2013: www.tcdailyplanet.net/dakota-protesters-meet-sesquicentennial-wagon-train/ When you research stories about the Sesquicentennial Wagon Train, it takes some digging to find mention of the protests. Instead, most news stories revel in the fireworks and celebrity speeches that marked Minnesota\u2019s hardscrabble Little House on the Prairie history. A decade later, Fort Snelling is still a flashpoint of controversy. In May 2019, the signs that read \u00a0\u201cFort Snelling Historic Site\u201d were replaced with newer signs that read \u201cHistoric Fort Snelling at Bdote.\u201d Now, those signs newer signs have been taken down because of public confusion. As part of the Fort\u2019s revitalization project, the Historical Society has begun an official public process about renaming the site. The Minnesota state legislature would vote on any recommended renaming. By contrast, the B&#8217;dote Memory Map is a living history of Dakota lands and culture. The project claims the Dakota occupied the land for nearly 10,000 years before the onset of settler colonialism in 1860, and they continue to exist. Through oral history plotted on the map, we learn why Fort Snelling is sacred land, and how the bluffs provide an ideal vantage point for seeing Wite Tanka (Pike Island) and the burial area that is now Pilot Knob. The memory map also tells the painful stories of Fort Snelling as the site of a Dakota concentration camp from 1862\u201363. Here, 1,700 people, primarily women, children, and elders, were imprisoned during the winter of 1862\u201363. For many Bdewakantunwan Dakota members, B\u2019dote is the center of the earth for them, and as such it is now both a site of genesis and genocide. I have been a Minnesota resident for fifteen years, and on most days I feel like a newcomer. Yet, I mostly feel comfortable teaching about the Mississippi River and its history. When it comes to Fort Snelling though, I shudder at the thought of attempting to represent all this site means. \u00a0Part of my hesitation is that Fort Snelling deserves an Anthropocenic reckoning; a deep time analysis that layers human and non-human histories together. It is meaningful that this Fort Snelling\u2019s bicentennial renovation is called a \u201crevitalization project.\u201d Breathing life into the Fort means listening to its ghosts. The B\u2019dote Memory Map provides some of these stories. A deep time history of the site could also juxtapose and intertwine many stories across time and space. It could render visible how slaves, including Harriet Robinson Scott and Dred Scott, may have interacted with Dakota peoples before, during, and after they were held in captivity at the Fort. The U.S. Supreme Court decided, 7-2, that the Scotts would remain enslaved in 1957. It is well known that this decision influenced the nomination of Abraham Lincoln\u2014who opposed the\u00a0Dred Scott\u00a0decision\u2014for the presidential election in 1860. Lincoln went on to sign the Homestead Act in 1862, creating the broader context for the Dakota War of 1862 and internment at Fort Snelling. What visions or nightmares of the United States of America did African-Americans and Dakota enslaved at Fort Snelling and beyond share? Go even deeper in time and we can imagine stories of human and geological agency woven together. Native peoples have inhabited the region since the Ice Age ended. The petroglyphs in Wakan Tipi (Carver\u2019s Cave), at modern day Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary, are interpreted to be a premodern planetarium. At the time those were drawn, St. Anthony Falls was located just outside Wakan Tipi in today\u2019s downtown St. Paul. The waterfall scoured the sandstone and limestone bluffs, essentially eroding its way upriver to Minneapolis. When we talk deep time on the upper Mississippi, it is at once human and natural history. Fort Snelling then appears as an important and bloody chapter, but by far only a brief chapter in telling the stories of B\u2019dote. As the Historical Society reimagines the stories it will tell of and at the Fort, I look forward to growing into a different relationship with this place. As a resident of the river, however long my roots grow, I want a renewed experience not only when I visit the site but also when I think about representing its stories to others. I simply want to know more and know more deeply. Fort Snelling has much to teach us beyond canon firings and blacksmith demonstrations; it is the place where so much of the history that shapes our deeply fraught modern Minnesota experience begins. B\u2019dote is a Dakota word, meaning where two waters meet, that refers to the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. The new signage raised the ire of many who argued this \u201crevisionist\u201d telling erases the military history of the site. This is not unlike the controversies about the renaming of Minneapolis\u2019 Lake Calhoun as \u201cBde Maka Ska\u201d by the Department of Natural Resources.

The bucolic scene of Dakota life near the Fort belies the cultural devastation being experienced at the time. These paintings tell not only different stories, but perhaps even fabricated ones.",

                "text": "History of the site The Fresh Kills landfill site covered 890 hectares in the New York City borough of Staten Island. The site was originally a coastal salt marsh, which hosted an opulent wildlife. Prior to 1934, it was acceptable to dump garbage at sea. Robert Moses, the \u201cmaster builder\u201d of the mid-twentieth century responsible for New York\u2019s urban development policies, established Fresh Kills landfill in 1947, as a temporary solution, at a time when disposing of waste at sea was forbidden. The landfill, one of the world\u2019s largest sanitary operations, was initially proposed as a temporary solution to New York\u2019s growing need to rethink waste disposal in the context of an exponential rise in consumption following the Second World War. Moses proposed a plan to develop a residential, recreational, and industrial area on Staten Island and use the dumping on soft marshland to prepare the soil for this development\u2014eventually the temporary solution became a fifty-year one. By 1955, it was already the biggest landfill in the world and remained so until its closure in 2001. At the peak of its operation, in 1986, Fresh Kills received 29,000 tons of residential waste per day. In 1991 it was the only landfill to receive New York City\u2019s residential waste. The four mounds on the site comprise approximately 150 million tons of solid waste. The landfill remains the world\u2019s largest man-made structure.",

A master planning process was established to turn the site into public parkland, reclaiming its original ecosystem and biodiversity. In 2001, the landfill received its last barge of garbage: the rubble from the World Trade Center. Then the mounds were covered with a thick impermeable cap. The transformation of the vast, reclaimed urban landscape started in 2006. In 2012, part of the former Fresh Kills site opened as a park. Planned as the largest park in New York City, it has a surface area of around 2.5 times that of Central Park. Engineered soil During a ten-month operation to prepare the site and keep the surrounding area safe from hazardous materials and gas emissions, 1.2 million tons of material waste was screened and sifted. A layer of clean soil at least a foot deep (30.48 cm) was added to protect the site and control erosion. Nowadays, Freshkills Park looks like a wild grassland, but in reality it is a highly engineered landscape. It is predicted that decomposition will take thirty years, and so the site is monitored closely by a sophisticated system built underground to collect and treat the by-products of waste decomposition. Methane harvested from the site powers local homes. Community Freshkills Park is an ongoing project that addresses a concern for sustainability and aims to establish interaction among people and nature in a metropolitan context. The park is designed to grow in response to both nature and evolving community needs. Education in renewable energy systems, such as solar, wind, water, and methane, is a highly valued component of the project. Manufactured nature This example of an extensive area of restored natural systems pushes us to question the threshold between the man-made and the natural. The nature that now covers Freshkills Park is \u201cmanufactured nature,\u201d built out of the artificial mounds that grew during the height of dumping activity and the more recent restoration of the original ecosystem through a planting scheme of local species. The seeming wild prairies that cover the Freshkills landscape are \u201cdomesticated nature.\u201d",

The landfill mounds at Fresh Kills are the result of fifty years of dumping household waste. If the Anthropocene concept claims that we are redistributing the resources of our planet, we witness in this case study how, through actions of such dimension, we are creating urban mines. Manufactured material waste is piled and compressed. We are leaving a trace by modifying the substance of soils and altering the topography, reshaping landscapes. This example highlights the long-term impact of human activity on a geological scale. As a designer dealing daily with materials, I see the Anthropocene as an advent of new matter. We are manufacturing soil and potential new minerals and, so far, we can wonder to what extent sites such as Fresh Kills are the ground floor to the future resources of our planet. It is interesting to observe how the planning authorities and the public are transforming the use of and engagement with this landscape. However, the waste management of New York City is an issue yet to be solved, having simply been displaced. The population of New York City now exceeds 8 million people and the trash produced is currently diverted to special waste drop-off sites, recycling centers, and several out-of-town dumps.",

Accordingly, 50 percent of NPP is directly recycled by the system for self-maintenance (functions, cycles). \u201cFlower Power\u201d signifies that flowering plants are the major biomass producers on land and thus in agriculture. The ecosystem economy is circular (no waste) and follows cycles and rhythms determined by solar and geophysical systems. Competition in ecosystems is subtle and bridled by a (near) real-time \u201ctaxation\u201d system with multifunction agents organized in food networks. Under stable conditions, the ecosystem economy generates an ecological reserve, a kind of insurance mechanism and resilience stock, against potential disorders or stresses. Within nature, a resilient and sustainable \u201ceconomy\u201d is the rule. Resilient ecosystems are productive, biologically diverse, and energetically efficient. Their resilience, built up over millions of years of evolution in diverse climates, relies mainly on the presence of diverse and often redundant actors. However, ecosystem services are not infinitely substitutable, in particular when combined stressful conditions altering critical planetary boundaries occur within a short timescale.

The remaining 15 percent of NPP is used to feed the food networks, i.e. biodiversity that is thriving on NPP. The immediate consequences of such a skewed distribution can be seen in the difficulty of preserving biodiversity nowadays. This problem will not disappear in the immediate future, because the human population continues to grow at a fast pace.

Humans take the narrow view of competition processes, the consequence being systemic environmental and social dumping, which generate socio-ecosystemic deficits and debts.

Clich\u00e9s and inconsistencies in science and political and diplomatic agendas   The Anthropocene debate and the considerations outlined above shed light on a series of inconsistencies addressed by agendas at present. 3.1 The sixth extinction and saving nature A clear distinction is required between biodiversity erosion and mass extinction processes.Anthony D. Barnosky et al., \u201cHas the earth\u2019s sixth mass extinction already arrived?,\u201d\u00a0Nature, vol. 471, no. 7336 (2011): pp. 51\u20127; Michael Hoffmann et al., \u201cThe impact of conservation on the status of the world\u2019s vertebrates,\u201d Science, vol. 330, no. 6010 (2010): pp. 1503\u20129. doi: 10.1126/science. 1194442.\u00a0It is a matter of magnitude (and timescale): extinctions concern a large percentage of species, in the range of 60\u201295 percent.Barnosky et al., \u201cHas the earth\u2019s sixth mass extinction already arrived?\u201d\u00a0Estimated extinction risk rates at present are 2.8 percent.Mark C.

Concerning \u201csaving nature,\u201d this is a childish assertion, arguments against which can be found in Table 1. 3.2 Climate change and biodiversity-loss dilemmas These two challenges are high on the agendas of recent years and perfectly illustrate the paradox of \u201cinstitutional success and environmental degradation.\u201dTancr\u00e8de Voituriez, \u201cThree commitments governments should take on to make sustainable development goals the drivers of a major transformation,\u201d\u00a0IDDRI Issue Brief\u00a0(Governance), no. 3 (2015): pp. 1\u20124.\u00a0This is not surprising. The climate issue is \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d; the increasing economic risks for businesses dominate over concerns for social welfare and poverty,See Mart A.

Note that Coral Davenport of the\u00a0International New York Times\u00a0(January 24, 2014) writes that the World Bank considers \u201cglobal warming (as) the chief contributor to rising global poverty rates and falling GDP in developing nations.\u201d At the same time, Davenport quotes in her article just cited, titled \u201cBusinesses add costs of climate to bottom line; executives discovering that the risk of inaction is too great to ignore,\u201d that OECD leaders admit that climate change is increasingly costly for the business community because of increasing economic risks. There are reasons to believe that the business community as well as concerned financial institutions (see the 44th Davos Forum, 2014) can find solutions and will mitigate the impact of climate change on their activities. Are the Davos solutions going to ease poverty rates and falling GDPs? Unlikely, but research should be engaged along these lines, because mitigation of climate change cannot be separated from Millennium Development Goals.\u00a0the political mood having switched from mitigation to adaptation. The \u201cpsychological climate paradox\u201d is another illustration: it refers to the \u201cgrowing discrepancy between the increasing scientific certainty about anthropogenic interference with the climate system and the decreasing popular concern and support for strong climate policies.\u201dPer Espen Stocknes, \u201cRethinking climate communications and the \u2018psychological climate paradox,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Energy Research &amp; Social Science, vol. 1 (2014): pp. 161\u201370. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2014.03.007.\u00a0Biodiversity, in turn, a main component of resources, is not easily measured or valued when it comes to indicators monitoring the dynamics of genetic and species diversityRodolfo Dirzo et al., \u201cDefaunation in the Anthropocene,\u201d\u00a0Science, vol. 345, no. 6195 (2014): pp. 401\u20126. doi: 10.1126/science.1251817; Maria Dornelas et al., \u201cAssemblage time series reveal biodiversity change but not systematic loss,\u201d Science, vol. 344, no. 6181 (2014): pp. 296\u20129. doi: 10.1126/science.1248484; Chris D.

The HANPP is a good example (see Table 1). The high levels of human appropriation are the primary cause of substantial changes in species abundance, distribution, and interaction; these are due in the main to habitat loss and degradation, land use, and climate change.Urban, \u201cAccelerating extinction risk from climate change\u201d; see also Barnosky et al., \u201cApproaching a state shift in Earth\u2019s biosphere.\u201d\u00a0Present levels of estimated extinction rates (2.8 percent) are expected to increase with climate change to approximately 5 percent (scenario + 2\u00b0C) and to approximately 16 percent (one species out of six; scenario + 4\u00b0C).Urban, \u201cAccelerating extinction risk from climate change.\u201d\u00a0Predicted extinctions from climate change are higher risk for South America (23 percent), Australia and New Zealand (14 percent), and lower risk for North America and Europe (5\u20126 percent).

Estimates are based on observable costs of management and restoration/rehabilitation (of land and soil, forests, water sources, rivers, or biodiversity) and the consumption of ecosystem capital, which is used and not paid for, embedded in international transactions. Presently such accounts increasingly benefit from big data systems, which allow for the continuous monitoring of state change and variation, through Earth monitoring by satellite programs, in situ monitoring systems, and fast processing of socioeconomic statistics. In other words, (near) real-time monitoring and accounting tools are becoming accessible at various territorial scales. For example, to measure the capacity of ecosystem production and servicing in a given territory an ecosystem capability accounting tool was developed,Weber,\u00a0Ecosystem Natural Capital Accounts.\u00a0presented, and discussed at the \u201cValuing Nature\u201d session during the Anthropocene Campus at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin.

However, we argue that there is no alternative to putting the economy within the limits of the biosphere. This requires a drastic change in our relationship to nature: from balance OF nature to balance WITH nature.Daniel Simberloff, \u201cThe \u2018Balance of Nature\u2019\u2014evolution of a panchreston,\u201d\u00a0PLoS Biol, vol. 12, no. 10 (2014): e1001963. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001963. Valuing nature can greatly contribute to this change, but the notion remains one of political wishful thinking unless the driving values of a sustainable humanity are implemented convincingly and jointly within society. Environmental responsibility starts with the proper quantifying of the human impact on ecosystems and using these metrics of nature valuation to preserve high-quality life-supporting systems in the long term. This is perfectly feasible, because quantitative and modeling tools are more readily available than ever before. Social justice starts with the reframing and the rebalancing of the current political determinants of socioeconomic and environmental power asymmetries in various layers and sectors of society. Ultimately, the synergic effects of the two values will end up with the equitable allocation of accessible resources within society and, last but not least, with a collective ambition to rethink and reclaim the commons. The Berlin case study chosen for the \u201cValuing Nature\u201d session, the \u201czero-debt\u201d exercise (see the pair of practicals), and discussions during the sessions indicated that society is not yet ready for such a \u201ccultural shift.\u201d In particular, the appropriation of \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cvaluing,\u201d the ideas and processes of valuing versus pricing nature,Hanley, \u201cPricing the planet.\u201d\u00a0have met with reluctance. One may predict that increased resource scarcity will inevitably change this view and stimulate research into alternative scenarios. The Anthropocene Campus cannot remain a single-shot experiment, therefore, and is here to stay, to experiment with ideas about the Anthropocene and search for reframing narratives: the narratives of the \u201cAge of Man\u201d (already coined by Buffon in 1784) and more likely the narratives of the \u201cAge of Mankind.\u201d",

Imaging the \u201cslow\u201d Anthropocene (i.e. the cultural acceptance principle)   The exercise, carried out in preparation for the \u201cValuing Nature\u201d session, also provided contextualization for the Berlin case study. The triple-principle frame (social justice, environmental responsibility, and cultural acceptance) was used as a reference. The idea consisted of simulating possible trajectories of societal change by imagining strong sustainabilityoptions leading to socio-ecosystemic resilience, i.e. more frugal, self-supporting societies. Ultimately, this approach allows one to anticipate the societal and ecological transition costs of a zero-debt society (economic, social, environmental, educational, etc.) as an aid to decision-making. Two hypotheses were considered that state: Hypothesis 1: \u2211R (available resources) = vital needs + wants (resources could cover both needs and wants; carrying capacity at equilibrium). Hypothesis 2: (vital needs + wants) &gt; \u2211R &gt; vital needs (carrying capacity &gt; available resources). A development model based on zero socio-ecosystemic debt was suggested in order to systematically: Internalize the socio-ecosystemic negative externalities (no dumping); Adjust resources to comply with the vital/fundamental needs of individuals. To this end, it appeared necessary to reconfigure institutions ensuring legitimate, transparent, equitable access to resources and to design instruments and norms for social justice (such as equitable access to resources, limiting the use of private property to encourage better use of the commons), and environmental responsibility (including policies on price, taxation, and subsidies).",

Conceptual clarity is achieved through the abstraction of the major elements of a given system. Accordingly, in this model, the global socioeconomic system has been abstracted down to the following processes that are required to illustrate the links between the environment and the economy: population growth; food and durable consumption; food and durable production; recycling; pollution treatment; renewable energy production; nonrenewable energy production; resource production; research into primary sector and secondary processes. A unique feature of the design approach taken with this model is that the system of feedbacks among all the processes represented is incomplete. The resulting discord, disequilibrium, or tension that arises from this structuring allows questions to be asked about why these tensions are appearing. Therefore, instead of the model providing a solution, the student is provided with an opportunity to prototype creative responses to complex systemic challenges. This makes the student an extension of and an integral part of the modeling process. When this approach is applied to a group of students, opportunities for discussion around differing worldviews and problem-solving strategies arise, highlighting that effective action depends on actors having a common understanding of the system in view, or a shared systems model.",

Consider which scenario would be easier to implement. Support from whom, or what system, would be needed to implement either of your scenarios? What kind of adaptive strategy would need to be included in the implementation of your plan? How could one create conditions now so that an adaptive implementation strategy is more likely to be followed over time? Translating a Narrative into a Model  Stories are woven into all cultures and societies and are an important medium for passing on information and, more importantly, knowledge. Models are also a medium in which stories are contained and relayed. In short, models start from stories and tell stories. The story starts like this. Sustainability is a property that is found within our socioeconomic system and is bound by the limits of the physical systems of the Earth. It is a dynamic property in that it applies to the trajectory of the system. Therefore, in order to determine whether our current socioeconomic system has the property of sustainability, we need to be able to examine the system\u2019s future evolutionary paths. Sustainability is a concept that implicitly includes a time dynamic\u2014namely, it applies to the trajectory of a system. In order to determine whether a socioeconomic system has the property of sustainability, it is necessary to examine its future evolution path. However, the future evolution path, in part, will result from human activities that are subject to choices which will be made in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to examine possible evolution paths that are contingent upon societal choices.   Selected Participants\u2019 Feedback   The GSS model is neither predictive nor prescriptive; the idea is to identify the consequences of asking: \u201cWhat if I change this about the world?\u201d GSS has a built-in model of the world\u2019s \u201cstocks and fluxes\u201d: population, food, durables, natural resources, forests, agricultural land, etc. The stocks and fluxes were calculated based on historical data that were collected by many institutions. The data is also present in the model, so that, for each quantity, you can plot a chronological graph. You cannot change this past, but you have a series of \u201ccontrol panels\u201d to visualize the \u201cfuture\u201d of this model. The default future is called \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d (BAU), and it includes four main \u201ctensions.\u201d A tension is an incompatibility between the required and the available stocks of something: crops, wood, energy, and labor are the quantities that undergo enormous tensions in the BAU future. You can modify this future and create alternative scenarios by visualizing and modifying the curves and by seeing what happens. [. . .] Something I discovered is a dramatic fall of wood availability in the near future. I didn\u2019t expect that. I always saw forests as an \u201cengine\u201d for photosynthesis, and therefore as a major factor influencing the composition of the atmosphere (by the way, atmosphere composition is not explicitly modeled in GSS). Instead, wood is required by humans for energy production and for constructions of all kinds. So much so that we cannot save the modeled trees without dramatically dropping the modeled society\u2019s demand for wood. It is not even enough to start planting and replanting forests everywhere because of the time lag implied for the trees to grow. Sustainability can indeed be achieved (most of the so-called \u201ctensions\u201d can be resolved in the context of the model). However, doing so requires a massive (and arguably impractical) reduction in per capita consumption and population. It was a (quantitative) revelation that even if we could effect immediate and significant changes in our societal values and transit to a low-consumption society, we would still not necessarily be able to nullify ecological overshoot for a significant amount of time.",

                "text": "What are commodities? And how do they circulate and flow, regionally and across the globe? And what can be learned about these issues from the exemplary Louisiana context, situated at the estuary of the Mississippi River Basin? Can this site provide one exemplification of how commodity flows have shaped and are shaping the epoch of the Anthropocene? The Anthropocene River Campus seminar title \u201cCommodity Flows\u201d refers to two distinct concepts. The first term concerns the general commodity form of certain types of matter and material objects, while the second is about the circulation of these commodities. Both the commodity form and the flow of commodities, it is important to emphasize, are not natural occurrences but are rather technically produced. Neither a fruit on a field, nor a mineral in the ground is already a commodity by itself. A market is required to produce the commodity form. Only the potential to circulate, to flow, to change its place, and thus role, in an economic system turns an object or a material resource into a commodity. Conversely, the modes of transportation employed for certain goods are not arbitrary. Very specific substances and things provoke certain flows. The terms \u201ccommodity\u201d and \u201cflows\u201d are not just linked but entangled with one another. The geography of the Mississippi River system is, on the one hand, a natural flowing system of water, climatic zones, sediment, plants, and animals. On the other hand, this natural system of currents is a platform for highly artificial flows of commodities supplied and demanded by industry, which are moved by motorized transport. During the Commodity Flows seminar, we aimed to discuss and examine the questions and complexities these coexisting currents pose. We did so by putting ourselves into an exemplary landscape where those flows are present, beginning at ByWater Institute of Tulane University directly on the banks of the Mississippi in New Orleans and from there traveling through the alluvial landscape of Louisiana. Utilizing a variety of methods\u2014including plenary discussions along with smaller group work to discuss concrete commodities and explore maps of their flows, plus artistic and performative interventions\u2014we aimed to translate some aspects of what is present in this geography, be it actual or historical, technical or social, obvious or hidden, into our academic, artistic, and activist discourse. Seminar trips included a visit to the Whitney Plantation, today a museum that tells the histories of those who were enslaved there, a visit to one of the biggest fertilizer plants on the planet, situated in the small town of Donaldsonville, and journey through the industrial corridor near St. James Parish, commonly referred to as \u201cCancer Alley\u201d, to engage with local activists and policymakers. Through these journeys, we immersed ourselves within the disturbingly dense landscape of actual and historical commodity flows. Fertilizers, addiction, and ammunition At the start of our first day at the ByWater Center, after the introductory and organizational remarks had concluded, seminar participants unknowingly encountered the first performative intervention into the \u201cexpected\u201d flow of the seminar itself. A woman began to speak in a raised voice: \u201cI\u2019m a pharmacist. I graduated from Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana and worked as a pharmacist for an independent store for five years.\u201d And the flow of her words didn\u2019t stop. It took a while to understand that a performance had started, something which became apparent when two other actors joined in with their own monologues, all of which were based on a text by Chicago artists Beate Geissler and Oliver Sann. The \u201cpharmacist\u201d was complemented by an \u201caddict\u201d and a \u201chistorian.\u201d What bound these three together was the flow of nitrogen through modern life and history. Fertilizers, addiction, and ammunition\u2014if chemical elements were actors, nitrogen would be cast as the hero of a tragedy. And there were very real tragedies to report, such as the story of Clara Immerwahr, a pacifist and the first female chemist with a PhD in Germany, as the historian explained. Her husband Fritz Haber was one of the key figures of nitrogen fixation in ammonia, and one of the leading chemists during the First World War. Haber\u2019s commitment to the development of poison gas drove Immerwahr to suicide in 1915, we learned, while his work on ammonia synthesis was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Without the possibility of producing ammonia synthetically for ammunition, the First World War, and the scale of its death toll, would not have been possible. But since the substance is also crucial for fertilizers, neither would it be possible to feed the world\u2019s population of the twentieth century without it. And the bitter lessons ammonia has to offer do not lie solely in the past. The enslavement of significant strata of the US population by methamphetamines is linked to the chemistry of ammonia, as was made clear by the character of the addict.",

                "text": "There are no simple stories with commodities, and the tone of the performance carried us back into reality as the seminar continued. The most obvious \u201cfunctional\u201d operation of the Mississippi River system is as a gigantic transport system. It is in fact the biggest system of inland navigation in the world, with direct access to all the world\u2019s oceans and to numerous agricultural and industrial areas in North America. From where it meets the Gulf to the Exxon Refinery located a little further upriver at Baton Rouge, it is dredged by the US Army Corps of Engineers to enable ocean-going freighters with a draught of up to 13 meters to travel down it. If there is any \u201ccommodity flow\u201d that can be easily observed with the naked eye, then it can be seen here in New Orleans, where all those waterways come together. So, it was fitting that the next step of the seminar was a boat tour of the Port of New Orleans. What we saw in the Port pointed to a geography that extends far beyond the immediate surroundings. Container ships were scarce; and what we saw filling huge push-pull \u2018tow\u2019 convoys up to 450 meters long were agricultural or chemical products in open barges. If this experience of the commodity flows passing by in the port was in any way representative, it would suggest that the USA\u2019s Midwest, the area that is connected to this port by the Mississippi, primarily produces raw materials and hardly any manufactured goods. Through this same act of observation, another dimension of flows became tangible. The unfamiliar and somewhat discordant sound of a steam-driven calliope organ from one of the historical steamships in the port made it clear that every mechanism of a flow of goods is contemporary while also being embedded in a historical flow. What now passes through the port of New Orleans is the effect of what has been transported and transformed through Louisiana\u2019s process landscape for centuries. Transportation is only one function of the mass of water below that was below our tour boat. When it enters, the water that flows into the port at 15,000 cubic meters per second has just passed one of the biggest chemical industrial areas in the world. In this \u201cpetrochemical corridor\u201d between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, the river provides the chemical raw material H2O, which is used for cooling processes and steam production in the various facilities lining the banks. The flow of water is here combined with another flow system. Situated at right angles to the flow of water are flows of oil and gas. Louisiana itself has significant oil deposits, which lie in the immediate vicinity of the delta and in an abundance offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. To this end, a confusingly dense network of pipelines crisscrosses and follows the river. Plantation, Dixie, Coastal, and Colonial, some of the most familiar names, are just a few of the pipelines linking the region with onshore and offshore oil fields between the Gulf, Texas, Oklahoma, Dakota, and Alberta. As barges come down river full of raw agricultural goods, the products of the chemical plants go back upriver to power the industrial agriculture of the Midwest, including fertilizers such as Fritz Haber\u2019s ammonia as well as pesticides. But much of this chemical soup returns, since the Mississippi also serves as an official and unofficial transport route for erosion and nutrient-enriched wastewater. Introducing the Bureau of Commodity Flows After the tour of the port, with impressions of flowing waters and ships fresh in our minds, we returned to ByWater Institute. As a condition of participation in the seminar, everyone had been asked to bring a commodity to the session and now it was time to compile and discuss them. However, in order to let the chosen objects and substances talk to each other and to us, to find out why they are commodities in the first place and how they relate to other commodities, it is was not enough to simply \u201cbring them along.\u201d After all, no commodity is simply brought on a ship or delivered to a factory or to a customer without the workings of another crucial element: bureaucracy. Accordingly, an employee of the fictitious \u201cBureau of Commodity Flows\u201d was also present during the seminar to supervise and explain the filling in of the forms required to accompany each commodity, and to ensure that correct administrative procedure were adhered to.",

Instead, these forms evidence an interest in the lifecycle of goods that few companies can be said to possess and the set of categories queried\u2014violent vs. peaceful, addictive vs. empowering, joyful vs. dreadful, reactionary vs. revolutionary\u2014do not originate from the realm of haulage so much as that of human subjectivity. The performing of such an exercise was obviously a distortion of what is typically understood as a \u201csmooth\u201d flow of goods. Just as we got started, we found ourselves faltering. It is tiresome to fill out the forms, not to mention annoying to have to appear as part of the form yourself. Some participants simply refuse to give names or contact details, others willingly give their telephone numbers and data\u2014 themselves prime commodities in the age of digital capitalism. With forms (more or less) completed, the next step was to use the commodities to talk with each other in small groups, with each provider was asked to introduce their particular commodity. So what ended up on the tables once the paperwork procedure was over? The commodities, in order of appearance and described using the name they were given by their respective commodity provider, were as follows: Water / Chaco brand shoe / Wind turbine blades / PVC (in bag and box form) / Alligator / Top soil / Sugarcane bagasse / Ethylene glycol / Turpentine / Insurance / Keys to a house in New Orleans / Soybeans / Mississippi River water / Southern Fried Cajun Peanuts / Mississippi River sediment / Pencil / King cotton / Hard white winter wheat / Phosphorus / Frac sand / Ibuprofen / Corn flour / Wax lined paper cup / Neoprene, chloroprene / Q-tip / History / Battery / Alligator / Phenol / Walker and Sons \u201cslap your mama\u201d green pepper sauce / Wooden stick / U.S. currency / Charging adaptor / Broken keychain trinket / Freshwater mussel / Truth wrap / Polyvinyl chloride PVC / Timber / Black body / Polyethylene pellets (\u201cnurdles\u201d) / Cotton in the form of a shirt.",

For none of these goods stands for itself: Water is constitutive of almost everything, while the commodity \u201chuman,\u201d which one participant brought to the seminar in the form of himself, has to do with almost all other goods in existence. Through the sugar cane specimen\u2014the longest commodity on display\u2014a connection is made between slavery and the chemical industry in Louisiana, the same context from which many of the substances on the tables originate. During the exercise, we could explore just some of the interrelationships of these exemplary commodities, as only five or six goods or things per group entered into conversation with their human companions. In a further step though, we followed up on selected substances or groups of goods on regional and global maps compiled and presented by the urbanist Nikos Katsikis. To track these, Nikos\u2019 presentation and maps made use of the digital data stream that accompanies the flow of goods. Just as the paperwork at the Bureau of Commodity Flows made explicit, digital data collated by the Federal government acts as a second-order flow to make the flow of commodities possible. Similarly, in the real world of logistics, only a good accompanied by paper or data is a \u201cgood\u201d good. As a side effect of these data flows, the geographic movement profiles of all the transported and industrially transformed goods can generate graphs that can then be translated into maps. What we discussed in our groups at our tables with our maps was mirrored outside the window of the ByWater Institute, a network of interconnected streams, current and historical.",

On the second day of activities, our first destination was the former Whitney Plantation, near Wallace, in St. John the Baptist Parish on the Mississippi River Road. The Whitney Plantation is one of the very few former plantations in the USA\u2014and the only one in Louisiana\u2014that is entirely dedicated to recounting the history of slavery and thus honoring to the memory of the people who for centuries were degraded through the trade of Black human bodies as commodities. Unlike other plantation museums, at the Whitney Plantation a focus upon white slave owners and their families is avoided. Instead, visitors to the former plantation manor house only enter those rooms in which the enslaved lived and worked in. The insights the seminar group received at this museum and memorial, from its research director Dr. Ibrahim Seck, were shocking. The everyday reality of those who were enslaved was brutal. They served under owners who did not shrink from rape as a means of both terror and of increasing the number of slaves they owned, and increasing their commodification. Similarly shocking is the ignorance with which contemporary US society confronts this heritage. As seminar participants from Louisiana reported, monuments to Confederate generals can only be dismantled under the protection of snipers, and the question of reparations for the families of the formerly enslaved is not even considered by Federal and State authorities.",

                "text": "During our visit, it became clear that sites like the Whitney Plantation are where the foundations of all current flows of goods in the Mississippi system were laid. The assets accumulated here were once the cornerstone of the North American economy. Until well into the nineteenth century, more US capital was invested in the slave trade than in technology, as one of the participants of the seminar explained. And it is these same flows that led to the onset of the Anthropocene, with human technological activities become perceptible at a planetary scale arguably for the first time. The shipping of hundreds of thousands of people from countries like now Senegal or Gambia from Western Africa to the American continent to be used as human machines to cultivate a crop that originally came from Asia, to supply a world market with concentrated chemical energy in the form of glucose, can only be understood in such planetary terms. Following the money\u2014and knowledge The seminar\u2019s next destination took us from the stories of those who were abused as \u201cfuel\u201d in a conveyor belt of planetary energy flows during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to those now suffering the effects of living alongside the facilities producing chemical fuels in the twentieth century in the very same region: Donaldsville, home to the largest fertilizer factory in the USA. What had seemed like something distant and to past history during the performance of the first day of the seminar\u2014the Haber-Bosch-process\u2014is very present and real here. The plant makes use of nitrate chemistry, which is at the center of the process that bonds nitrogen from the atmosphere to hydrogen, currently produced from natural gas through catalysis to produce ammonia (NH3). In Louisiana this is integrated within one of the largest petrochemical production complexes on the planet. For 100 miles between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, one encounters refinery after refinery, chemical plant after chemical plant: Exxon, BASF, Shell, Rubicon, Praxair, Air Liquide, Formosa, Shintech, Mexichem, Poly One, Mosaic, CF Industries, Chevron, Sid Richardson, Epsilon, Marathon, Nalco, Colonial Sugar, Witco, DSM Polymer, and countless more.",

                "text": "Companies from all around the globe, from the US, Asia, and Europe produce here. In particular German companies such as BASF have left traces, not at least by the history of German chemical industry. Already in the eighteenth century, the region was called \u201cGerman Coast\u201d on account of the number of German settlers and plantations and the industrial history around towns with German names, such as Geismar, Essen, and Siegen, adds more to that story. After the invention of the Haber-Bosch process around 1910 at BASF, hydrocarbons also became a subject for German chemists. Coal was planned to be transformed into liquid fuel, but the project turned out to be more complex and expensive than expected, with potential benefits for not only the coal industry but also oil companies. As a result, at the end of the 1920s, US-oil companies such as Standard Oil of New Jersey and German chemistry such as I.G. Farben started a formal cooperation. Shared laboratories were established in Baton Rouge, and a new hydrocarbon chemistry was developed to produce fuel in the years before the two countries found themselves at war. This historical flow of knowledge and money needs to be taken into account to understand the industrial landscape at the Mississippi and its present role for global commodity flows. What is processed here today is part of a historical process, and it was the historical process that shaped infrastructures that would transform commodities in an unprecedented way. From molecular mobilization to machine mobilization Through this chemical history, commodity flows are therefore not only recognizable as the geographical shift of substances, but also in the form of internal, chemical mobilization. In the pipeline systems and reactors of chemical plants, substances are both on the move and in transformation, so that dynamics can be set in motion at other locations, up- and downstream. The main product of the plant in Donaldsonville, fertilizer, is one of the best examples of this. Fertilizers are chemical substances, but it is the biosphere, where they set growth in motion. As such, they have effects on the regional but also on the planetary biosphere and its material flows of the Anthropocene. They are transported in huge ships from Louisiana to the soya and corn steppes in the Midwest, but thanks to erosion, a large proportion of the chemicals flows right back past the plants where they originated, eventually leading to algae blooms in the Gulf of Mexico and the creation of oxygen-free \u201cdead zones.\u201d What we saw from behind the fence of the plant and as tried to understand these interlinking flows is representative of the molecular-planetary industry as a whole. It is through the same form of technology, of the kind that rules the fertilizer plant at Donaldsonville and the petrochemical corridor, developed at the beginning of the twentieth century, that the geography of the planet and flows within the biosphere and the sphere of human technology as a whole have changed. It is only through this type of molecular mobilization that the machine powered mobilization of commodity flows\u2014in freighters, trucks, and planes\u2014has become possible. It was only with this technical chemical energy regime that the Great Acceleration of the twentieth century was possible: population growth, global exchange, global economic growth\u2014and with it all the commodity flows that we understand as typical of the Anthropocene. And here we were able to connect the industrial chemical sphere of the twentieth century with the brutal plantation sphere that we learned about just before at Whitney. There is no way to think about the one ignoring the other, since today\u2019s industrial infrastructure occupies the same sites (the packages of land along the river) as former plantations. Today, not even the masters of those plantations, in their palace-like houses and with all the workforce they abused, commanded the powers that we as ordinary car owners are used to in the form of fossil horsepower. In fact, none of those who participated at the seminar, regardless of which continent they traveled from to New Orleans, live a life that does not, in part, depend upon petrochemistry. Motor fuels, aspirin, superglue, Gore-Tex, artificially fertilized food\u2014the list of commodities that intersect with petrochemistry appears almost endless. The local effects of global dependencies In the context of commodity flows, \u201caddiction\u201d as one of the topics of the lecture performance of the first day refers not just to a pharmacological issue affecting individuals. It is also an apt way of describing the era of late capitalism, a modus operandi that only \u201cworks\u201d when it has access to a constantly increasing input of increasingly complex substances. Traveling through the petrochemical corridor, we learned a lot about the concrete, ecological, but also social consequences of this lifestyle. The condition of the consumer of commodity flows as an addict is one way to problematize these flows. But by traveling to the petrochemical corridor, we were able to go even further and observe the problems caused not only for consumers but for the communities where the production of these chemicals happens. Scott Eustis, Community Science Director of Healthy Gulf, joined us for this endeavor and presented the work of his organization to fight the problems of pollution and associated issues environmental justice. On the ground, the situation didn\u2019t require a flipchart or a projector\u2014the view through the bus windows, of countless facilities belching out white plumes of toxic smoke and accreted mounds of bright yellow sulfur, towering over the small communities sandwiched in between, told us everything we needed to know. Thanks to his in-depth knowledge of the region and the issues affecting it, Scott was able to organize meetings with a local activist and a councilman. The activist was Travis London, a young mayoral candidate who we met in Donaldsonville, while on a second stop at a small stretch of residential homes nestled between large storage facilities for oil and petrochemical products, we met Councilman Clyde Cooper from St. James Parish. Through these meetings, one could see how much courage, wisdom, and pragmatism is needed to manage communities in this region. It remains to be seen whether the planetary perspective should become the guiding principle for all local decisions, or whether much would already be gained if the simple laws of the state, such as those governing the taxation of corporate profits or environmental guidelines, were followed before starting to discuss planetary legislation. What we learned from Clyde and Travis was something like the antithesis to the famous 1930s slogan of the chemical company DuPont: \u201cBetter Things for Better Living&#8230; Through Chemistry.\u201d Such a promise\u2014that the petro-modern age would grant freedom, that a better life is possible with fuels, pharmaceuticals, and plastics\u2014rings hollow in Louisiana\u2019s petrochemical corridor today. The subject takes on an even more disturbing dimension when one considers that it is at places like this, in an area where people have few choices, commonly referred to as \u201cCancer Alley,\u201d and the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Energy has now branded hydrocarbons as \u201cfreedom molecules\u201d. Flow interventions Real answers to what we faced in the petrochemical corridor would be a tough goal for a two-day traveling seminar. But we had done our best with the academic and artistic toolbox at our disposal to keep at least our questions as complex as they need to be here and to connect with the flows of various commodities, in their present and their historical incarnations, as real things we \u201cprocessed\u201d at the \u201cBureau of Commodity Flows\u201d, as data at the mapping session, as the subject of a moving performance, and as products of a vast industrial district that can be visited as a disaster tourism monstrosity but which is also as an area of human life and work for thousands of people.",

The academic discussion of the Anthropocene and commodity flows became a mere backdrop, as our bus driver Thomas entered into conversation with Clyde and Travis. After a whole day of driving our group with visiting seminar participants through the area, Thomas shared his experiences as Louisiana local. He described the challenges that come with living in the surrounding polluted neighborhoods, where people try to grow vegetables on the poisoned ground of former landfill sites, where petrochemical profit has almost been habitually placed above the wellbeing of residents. Once again, the flow of words, which went back and forth between Thomas and the two politicians, didn\u2019t stop. But unlike the performance of the first day, this time the flow was not the result of any intervention curated by the organizers; it was the reality of the region itself, one dramatically shaped\u2014and deeply scarred\u2014by commodity flows, that intervened into our seminar.",

                "text": "Initially formulated to indicate humankind\u2019s total impact on the global environment, the concept of the Anthropocene draws all humanity into Earth history. Especially in the modern period of dramatic human-environmental change, it distinguishes the Earth as a grand collective project and problematic, so appearing to justify and legitimize a new round of techno-scientific management of the &#8220;Earth System&#8221;. At the same time, the &#8220;environmental crisis&#8221; has also been called a crisis of culture, and thus of imagination. In this sense, it begs the attention of the humanities, which have always been concerned with the human experience, even as it challenges their underlying assumptions and practices. This symposium engages the tripartite challenge facing humanities scholarship today: the need to expand beyond Western narrative/disciplinary super-structures\u2014in which human separation from nature is a fundamental component\u2014and to simultaneously address &#8220;alternative&#8221; subjects and societal experience and the role of environment and nature itself as constituent element in this experience. In this sense the Anthropocene concept\u2014useful now as it encapsulates in a single word the grand theoretical tradition that has so defined Western understandings of modernity and nature itself\u2014must be taken down to the ground, to the lived experience that composes the long cultural-ecological histories of Asia. The Anthropocene therefore presents an epistemological problem that, if taken seriously, is also ultimately an ontological opportunity. The question of the knowledge that is considered legitimate and relevant now as human societies face rapid social-ecological change is linked so closely to particular cultural understandings of the agencies that constitute the known world. How to see such knowledge, cultures and ecologies in themselves as agents that indeed have also created the Earth? This symposium asks humanities and interdisciplinary scholars how to re-conceptualize the significance of the humanities now, in light of the history and modern day contexts of Asia, in which humankind\u2019s inevitable experience has formed part of an always dynamic, yet changeable nature.

No one had seen anything close to this before and it was soon named the Maas Monster. Over a scientific learning curve of decades, the archaeological artifacts of the giant predator were identified: the sea-reptile turned out to be a critical indicator for a geological period later named Maastrichtian, dating the limestone strata around the region of today\u2019s Maastricht as 66 million-year-old seafloor.

                "text": "Carbondale, Illinois, was named after the coal habit that sustained it and the surrounding Confluence region for two centuries. Although no longer the main economic driver, coal remains an emotional driver that is deeply engraved in regional social identities. The local baseball team is called the Miners. In this space between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, east into Indiana and Kentucky and south to the confluence of the two great rivers, extraction forged patterns of human life. Agrarian settlements evolved into towns as immigrants flowed in from Europe. Both immigrants and cash-poor farmers became labor in the mines. Besides coal, other raw materials were exported for the benefit of metropolitan centers\u2014timber, petroleum, salt, minerals, and more\u2014each extractive wave reinforcing the regional pattern. To this day, despite the damage to land, ecosystems, and the lungs and bodies of inhabitants, extraction is justified by the employment it provides. Illinois\u2019s flirtation with fracking is just the most recent chapter. Those who wish to silence conversation about an end to all this hole digging always raise job loss as an obstacle. This presumed conflict between environment and employment forms a central regional debate. Our panel for Field Station 4: Confluence Ecologies, \u201cThe Politics and Economics of Care,\u201d addressed this antagonism between ecosystems and economic stability with three very different initiatives, each sharing how economic decisions can be infused with methods and metrics of care: Concerned Citizens of Carbondale is an established local group searching for ways to abate the toxic contamination that remains from a former industrial facility, now a brownfield; Carbondale Spring, which emerged comparatively recently, in 2019, is dedicated to forging futural practices that incorporate an ethics of care into municipal economic decision-making; and through their business, Fin Gourmet, John Crilly and Lula Luu seek a restorative impact on both biological and social ecosystems by harvesting unwanted \u201cexotic\u201d fish in the Mississippi watershed. Each of these initiatives responds to the problem of relegating human and ecosystem damage to the sidelines as externalities, speaking to and magnifying the different kinds of violence borne within the processes of Anthropocenic development. They each seek to redress these generalized forms of violence by adapting to the limitations and opportunities of their socioeconomic and political situations, in all their complexity and contradiction. Concerned Citizens of Carbondale (CCC) seeks acknowledgment of and reparations for the contamination of their community\u2019s bodies and land from an industrial railroad-tie plant sited at the edge of the Northeast quadrant of Carbondale, a predominantly Black, low-income and working class residential neighborhood. For much of the twentieth century, this facility treated timber with coal-tar creosote for ties and telephone and electricity poles. The proximity of jobs to the railroad encouraged workers and their families to settle near the plant, but they also had little choice, as Jim Crow laws and redlining ruled out other housing locations. During the \u201cThe Politics and Economics of Care\u201d panel, CCC member Sheila Brown spoke about the thick smoke that would blow into the neighborhood around her home when the plant was in operation. She related how workers would attempt to protect their homes and families from exposure to the foul substance by stripping off their work clothes and burying them overnight in the earth to soak up the tar, before entering their houses. The enterprise had a doctor to treat plant employees, but citizen activists have been unable to locate the medical records which might have provided evidence linking worker illnesses to creosote or Pentachlorophenol exposures. Following the plant\u2019s closure in 1991 and a mandated cleanup by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2004, CCC members began to draw connections between the brutality of the worksite, a cluster of deaths from myeloma and other cancers in the Northeast Carbondale neighborhood, as well as the longer socioeconomic pattern of making profit from Black bodies. When a solar business specializing in brownfield development sought to obtain the site in 2014, CCC launched an intersectional campaign to educate the community in environmental racism. While not opposed to solar itself, they are adamantly against disturbing this land again. For CCC, reparations means prohibiting new development or any new profiting from this site, which they hope will be allowed to grow back into a forest. Carbondale Spring (CS) is inspired by as many movements are there are members: autonomist anarchism, municipalism, economic civil rights, environmental justice, LGBTQA rights, and police abolition. The group is driven by the premise that the climate crisis urgently calls for the redistribution of productive means and skills in order to provide economic self-determination and a good living for all in the city. Its four-part platform involves the support of Mondragon-style business cooperatives, low-interest loans for sustainable energy development, food accessibility for all through a network of city farms, and, finally, creation of a cadre of care workers to provide the kind of social safety net generally absent in the United States. These \u201ctherapists, social workers, holistic healers, and just average do-gooders\u201d would be available to respond to situations usually addressed by the police,\u201cCare Workers,\u201d Carbondale Spring\u2019s website, n.d., https://carbondalespring.org/care-workers/who are ill-trained to handle people with mental illnesses or experiencing emotional distress and other nonviolent emergencies. CS\u2019s four proposed programs: support for cooperative businesses, sustainable energy, food access and care workers would all be funded by the reallocation of half the City of Carbondale\u2019s police department budget, which is disproportionately large compared to similar cities in the United States. Convincing a municipality to reduce its police force is difficult, because such a proposal works against a received notion that policing leads to safety. In response, Carbondale Spring leverages lessons learned from Ferguson, Missouri, only two hours away, where several CS members were organizing against state-sanctioned violence against people of color. In Ferguson, it was documented that law enforcement disproportionally negatively impacts those who are Black and poor in a community, leading to an exacerbation of economic burdens. By monetarily tying law enforcement reduction to an increase in compassionate services dedicated to alleviating despair, CS hopes to de-escalate the slow social violence and de facto criminalization experienced by a share of the city\u2019s residents, particularly Black youth. CS\u2019s vision is the revitalization of the city through fostering the prospects of good living for all, and its program is tailored to the problems, demographics, and skill base particular to Carbondale. Cooperatives, for example, are a pragmatic answer to economic development in a community with many shuttered businesses for sale, but little capital.",

The owners, John Crilly and Lula Luu, are former academics in health policy and nutrition who gave up secure research positions to start an Asian carp fish-processing company that would put their knowledge into direct practice to help others. A non-native species introduced into the Mississippi watershed some fifty years ago, the Asian carp is reviled as an invasive scourge in Midwestern rivers. Despite the fact that it is one of the most abundant, nutritious, and delicious wild-caught fish around, very little use is made of this natural resource; while at the very center of the region\u2019s ecology, these fish are kept at the cultural and economic periphery. Fin Gourmet\u2019s mission is to change that by creating both a supply and a demand for this untapped superfood. Most Americans have never tasted the Asian carp and much of what is caught is shipped to markets on other continents. But harvesting Asian carp for US markets would not only make the freshwater fish more available, it would be an appropriate way to keep fish population down. It\u2019s reproductive vigor and lack of predators has led to fears the fish will enter the Great Lakes system, a concern because the fish outcompetes \u201cnative\u201d species. Within the rivers, it is said to exacerbate the decline of some species that were already threatened by habitat loss due to river engineering and channelization. For Crilly and Luu, harvesting Asian carp is a way to help repair riverine ecological imbalance, while providing a nourishing source of protein. Crilly and Luu take their business a step further in its engagement in an economy of care by recruiting and hiring people recently released from incarceration or in recovery from addiction. This commitment contributes to the reintegration of people experiencing marginalization into a social economy. As part of the Field Station 4 panel, Crilly and Luu shared their vision, and the many attendant challenges, of seeking to do \u201cbusiness as unusual\u201d by coupling together ecological, economic, and social well-being. As the panel presenters demonstrate through their initiatives, an economy of care sets its sights upon the most uncared for inhabitants and ecosystems, and reimagines existing ecologies of human-social, economic, and ecological relationships. The participants of \u201cThe Politics and Economics of Care\u201d invited us to notice more carefully the myriad ways violence\u2014as pollution, neglect, and human and ecosystem overpolicing\u2014is engineered into current systems of economic production. In closing, the speakers reflected on how economies based on rampant extraction inevitably generate a disingenuous conflict between jobs and environment by leveraging local needs against the dynamic fungibility of capital. As the mines in the Confluence region of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers slowly close, no evidence of the wealth created is being left in the wake. A \u201cpolitics and economics of care\u201d encourages us to investigate creative reconfigurations that cut through a false dichotomy of jobs versus environment, in order to transform relations among both human and nonhuman citizens, and everything in between.",

It is a time in which humans intervene in nature, and thus change and shape it. A world has developed in which humans and their needs play a dominant role in the ecological system. Agriculture, trade, transportation, and industry: as long as humans have existed we have been utilizing and altering our environment. Industrialization, in particular, has contributed to the unmistakable and often irreversible fingerprint that we are making upon the Earth. Today, the human imprint is so deep and pervasive that scientists, policymakers, and society are considering whether human-caused changes are affecting the geological record over the long term\u2014and there is talk that a new geological era has arrived. Welcome to the Anthropocene! This thesis was first introduced fifteen years ago and has been the topic of much debate since then. At first, the idea of an \u201cAge of Humans\u201d was only discussed among geologists, but now it has evolved into a multidisciplinary mental framework that links scientific and engineering theories and approaches to social and cultural scientific concepts. Humans in the Anthropocene not only intervene in nature as geological and biological actors, they also initiate mental processes in order to reinterpret the relationship between nature and culture, environment and society. So far, the Anthropocene is only a hypothesis and there is no consensus about its temporal scope or its scientific status. With its special exhibition on the Anthropocene, the Deutsches Museum is taking part in the global debate on this topic. In cooperation with the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society, the Deutsches Museum is the first such institution to present the Anthropocene in a large-scale exhibition. In doing so, the two Munich institutions have created a space for reflection, interpretation, and discussion\u2014and for further research on human\u2013nature interrelations.",

What is typical in the world of the Anthropocene? What will we eat? What will our cities look like? Will machines take control of our world, which is already highly automatized and regulated by algorithms? Through selected topics such as urbanization and mobility as well as evolution and food, the exhibition explores the past, present, and future of humanity. Historical artifacts trace the technology that put us on the path to the Anthropocene, while current research presents the challenges we are facing today, as well as possible solutions. Artistic interpretations provide visions for the future and ask us to look at the world in new ways. At the entrance, a supersized media cube familiarizes visitors with the Anthropocene by showing short video clips and an additional movie on this topic. The object shelf, which embraces the whole exhibition room and resembles a huge notebook or diary, presents real objects that trace the increasing influence of humans on the natural world, from industrialization to the present. Six large thematic \u201cislands\u201d address the following topics in detail: urbanization, mobility, humans and machines, nature, food, and evolution. They highlight the Anthropocene\u2019s effects and interactions on a global, biological, and social level. Carefully selected objects in combination with the central installation of film and media stations illustrate the spatial and temporal dimensions of human-caused global change and the chances and challenges we face in the Anthropocene. The exhibition contains multiple participatory elements. In particular, it invites visitors to answer such pressing questions as: what will the Anthropocene look like in the future? What sort of future do you wish for? What dangers do you see, what motivations are there for change, what are you afraid of, and what are your hopes for the Anthropocene? Visitors can take a sheet of paper and write down their thoughts, wishes, fears, and suggestions. They fold the paper and place it on a vacant stem in the flower bed.

Focusing on human\u2013plant conspiracies, Myers contends that certain types of gardens can be read \u201cas evidence of a range of radical solidarity projects that take as \u2018given\u2019 that we are of the plants\u201d and that \u201cour futures hinge on creating livable futures with the plants.\u201dIbid., p. 3. These ideas are useful in trying to understand the multifaceted program of the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria (RBGV), which includes a new management scheme known as the Landscape Succession Strategy. The Strategy, in part, will guide the transition of the RBGV\u2019s selection of plantings into one that is more suitable for the projected climatic conditions of 2090. Midway through the Anthropocene Campus, Melbourne, about twenty participants travelled south of the city center and the Yarra River, to land now known as the Melbourne Gardens of the RBGV. First established in 1846 and now covering an area of thirty-six hectares, the RBGV houses thousands of plants in their living collection and approximately 1.5 million dried plant and fungi specimens in the National Herbarium of Victoria. After gathering at the visitor center, Den, our guide for the Aboriginal Heritage Walk, greeted us and asked everyone their name and where they were from\u2014a gesture that made the whole group implicitly aware of its shared status as (uninvited) guests. The Aboriginal Heritage Walk is a recurring event promoted by the RBGV that aims to highlight the histories and living cultures of the traditional owners of the land. The first stop on our walk was the Oak Lawn, which was established throughout the nineteenth century with the planting of oak species from Europe, Asia, and America. It was here, surrounded by these non-native trees planted by early colonizers, that we were formally welcomed to the land of the Wurundjeri people by Den, an Aboriginal elder whose own ancestry lies in country (referring to lands and waters, as well as seasons, stories, and spirits) further north. In this way, we were all convening on this land as visitors, though having arrived through strikingly different trajectories. Den lit a small fire while explaining the significance of different plants in smoking ceremonies. Having given each of us a eucalyptus leaf, he invited each of us in turn to approach to add our leaf to the flames and circle the fire while waving the fragrant smoke over ourselves. Den then guided us through another part of the garden, stopping periodically as he taught us how to see and appreciate the qualities and uses of particular plants. After our walk, we again gathered on the Oak Lawn where cups of lemon myrtle tea were distributed to everyone and Den and his young assistant spoke of the broader context of what we had experienced. Holding up a map of Aboriginal Australia, one of them pointed to where we were, on the land of one nation among hundreds of others. They then held up the Aboriginal Flag and explained its significance: black represents the people, yellow the sun, and red the earth.",

Casid, Sowing Empire: Landscape and Colonization. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2005. Writing primarily in the context of eighteenth-century North America, Casid considers \u201cthe category-complicating early slave gardens\u201d as fundamental reorderings of the master\u2019s plantation.Ibid., p. 194. The provision of land parcels on the part of plantation owners in some regards was a means of evading the costs of providing food or of rooting an enslaved person to one place. Still, there is much to gain from \u201ca rereading of early slave gardens as everyday aesthetic practices of resistance [which go] beyond poaching to a transformative appropriation of the very ground of the plantation system.\u201dIbid., p. 195. Following Casid\u2019s work, it is true that the history of the RBGV, as a former outpost of Kew Gardens in London, is, like other histories, one of displacement. While extremely important, one might view the incorporation of an Aboriginal Heritage Walk into the formal program of the Gardens\u2014along with the Australia-specific gesture of acknowledging country at public events, or the adoption of the Aboriginal flag as an official flag of Australia\u2014as a dubious concession, comparable to that of the slavemaster granting slaves the land to keep a garden. In processing our experience in the Gardens, there is perhaps a justifiable temptation to construct an opposition between the voices we heard. Perhaps an open question would be more generative, bearing in mind that the plantations which once housed slave gardens no longer exist: What future worlds are being invited when space is made for a young Aboriginal man to raise his flag in a colonial garden?",

Segregation, he said, has continued in the South through means of economic inequalities. While the growing interest of white tourists taking his tours may help to popularize his work\u2014an interest some postcolonial scholars theorized as \u201cwhite guilt\u201d\u2014this alone does not have a meaningful impact on the development of the museum\u2019s activities, if it is not accompanied by material reparation. I see this whole scene as a mirror image of the abyssal reflections that confronted Duncan and I from the very first day of our journey. No matter how blurry our landmarks might have been, they bluntly forced us to situate ourselves in the environment in which we had landed from Paris only the night before. As we were sitting in the foggy atmosphere of the secret sports-jazz place, listening to the shattering testimonies of our host, I was submerged in questions that I have spent weeks trying to unpack. I will spare you the \u201cWho am I?\u201d existential type\u2014glaringly evident here\u2014and go straight to the \u201cWhat am I here for?\u201d ones, which I believe carry more heuristic accuracy in this case. Duncan and I had been invited for a residency in the Southeastern United States, supported by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in Atlanta, Georgia. During this residency, we decided to follow the participants of the Anthropocene River Journey from their last field station to the Anthropocene River Campus at New Orleans. Duncan is an actor and a theater maker, specialized in the use of research material on stage to explore presentations of the contemporary condition that break away from classical theater standards. I work on the emergence of the Anthropocene hypothesis in the worlds of the arts and the humanities at the Ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure\u2019s\u00a0Sciences, Arts, Creation and Research laboratory. Both of us were trained in ecological thought and political art, and deeply inspired by Donna Haraway when she wrote: \u201cIt matters which stories tell stories, which concepts think concepts. Mathematically, visually, and narratively, it matters which figures figure figures, which systems systematize systems.\u201dDonna Haraway, \u201cAnthropocene, Capitalocene, Plantationocene, Chthulucene: Making Kin,\u201d Environmental Humanities, vol. 6, no. 1 (2015): pp. 159\u201365. As I was trying to study, as part of my PhD thesis, the many stories that have been told about the Anthropocene, I stopped on the HKW\u2019s Anthropocene Project . It was the very first pluridisciplinary research platform concerned with the geological hypothesis, and many of the actors and agents I had been looking at were involved. With environmental history, I have learned that even thoughts have environments, and I found a way to situate mine through the Anthropocene Project\u2019s curatorial narratives. The documentation of the project also became common ground for Duncan and I. We looked at the discourses of the inaugural meeting of the Anthropocene Working Group,The broadcast can be listened to here: Haus der Kulturen der Welt, \u201cHuman Impacts and Its Consequences\u201d: https://www.hkw.de/en/app/mediathek/video/32065 which was given a stage at a performative and cultural institution rather than at one or another geological society, as one might have expected. After this meeting, Duncan and I wrote a play called Matters, a polyphonic assemblage in which Duncan transforms the historical, scientific, and political voices of the working group members evaluating the hypothesis into a one-man show, bringing to light the frictions of thinking that occur when sciences get up on stage. It is the very ambiguous relationship of Matters with reenactment and science fiction that brings me back to the overwhelming reflections that struck Duncan and I in the subdued atmosphere of the room where we were watching our guide\u2019s performance. When writing Matters, both Duncan and I realized we had to stick to the Anthropocene\u2019s dominant scientific and political narrative in order to be coherent with the discourses of the Anthropocene Working Group\u2019s inaugural meeting. Including what we clumsily named \u201calternative stories to the main Anthropocene narrative\u201d would have given them the status of mere commentaries next to the dominant one. Yet, in my view, ecological thought starts by exploring both the dominant and the alternative in a symmetrical manner. Thus Matters became an introduction to the geological hypothesis, rather than an experimentation with the plurality of other possible worlds and temporalities that humanist, artistic, and critical accounts of the conceptual version of the notion imply. To accomplish the latter, we needed more experience and encounters. The Mississippi. An Anthropocene River journey, by aiming \u201cto make the Mississippi River basin legible as a zone of ecological, historical, and social interaction between humans and the environment using novel forms of exchange, research, collaboration, and pedagogy,\u201d\u201cMississippi. An Anthropocene River\u201d: https://anthropocene-curriculum.org/ seemed like an inspiring opportunity for just that. The project situates the hypothesis in a specific territory, localized in the heart of Western modernity, bridging the gap between such a global concept as the Anthropocene and intimate experience. For Duncan and I, it also raised the problem of how to present the dynamics that occur between the actors and agents of such a territory in a theater. So we started to look at the material produced by the Anthropocene River learning experiment as our field of inquiry, while our group was in the process of trying to \u201cunderstand the river as a composite and storied space\u201d Anthropocene Curriculum Berlin Project Team, \u201cIn Situ Anthropocene: Curatorial Statement\u201d: https://anthropocene-curriculum.org//contribution/in-situ-anthropocene\u2014producing a sort of double-layered research and creation project, a stratigraphic and multidisciplinary study of one another, to understand the territorial relationships of ones to the others. But what the encounter with our Natchez guide made me experience intimately is the sensitivity of this object-subject relationship. His work cannot be adequately reduced to an example of either \u201can alternative story to the dominant Anthropocene narrative\u201d or \u201ca composite and storied space.\u201d If I believe his reenactments are strongly connected to the ones Duncan and I wrote for Matters in terms of methodology\u2014in both cases, we are reenacting cultural institutions\u2019 archives in order to imagine alternative scenarios to our past, present, and future condition\u2014then every other aspect of our respective performances are marked by immense inequalities. The historic, economic, racial, and institutional factors that structure our individual speculative reenactments are deeply unequal. For one, they are marked by continuous exploitation and segregation. For another, European privilege is found in each of the abovementioned dimensions. Since environmental exploitation and extraction are intimately intertwined with the history of slavery and colonization, how can we avoid reproducing the same extractivist dynamics that brought us into the same room? In other words: Could I potentially be extracting my fellows from the Anthropocene River project, who are themselves extracting our Natchez host, whom I am extracting by extracting my fellows from the Anthropocene River project, exploiting each other all the way down\u2014and so in total contradiction with the very reasons that gathered us together that day? I had to dig into this overwhelming question, which obliged me to situate myself as an ecological intellectual. I felt it was flirting with the core of the research and creation process I\u2019ve engaged in over the past few years. I want to share here a short and nascent state of my inquiry through Field Station 5 with that problematic in mind. As I was sharing my thoughts with my friend and colleague in knowledge production analysis Jamie Allen while on a bus ride to a levee near New Orleans during the \u201cUnbound Engineering\u201d seminar a couple weeks later, he advised me to have a look at what he accurately called \u201cextractive epistemologies.\u201d I started by opening up Macarena G\u00f3mez-Barris\u2019s Extractive Zone, tracing \u201cthe political, aesthetic, and performative practices that emerge in opposition to the ruinous effects of extractive capital,\u201d the objective of which is \u201cto decolonize the Anthropocene\u201d: My objective is to decolonize the Anthropocene by cataloguing life otherwise, or the emergent and heterogeneous forms of living that are not about destruction or mere survival within the extractive zone, but about the creation of emergent alternatives. Unlike these doomsday approaches that play with destruction scenarios on the scale of the planetary, I study at the level of submerged life worlds within Indigenous territories, while pointing to African-descendent territories and ontologies, modes of living that, even if not often perceivable, exist alongside extractive capitalism.Macarena G\u00f3mez-Barris, The Extractive Zone: Social Ecologies and Decolonial Perspectives, Dissident Acts. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2017, p. 4. Throughout her work, she defines what she calls the \u201cextractive view,\u201d similar to a \u201ccolonial gaze\u201d: Before the colonial project could prosper, it had to render territories and peoples extractible, and it did so through a matrix of symbolic, physical, and representational violence. Therefore, the extractive view sees territories as commodities, rendering land as for the taking, while also devalorizing the hidden worlds that form the nexus of human and nonhuman multiplicity. This viewpoint, similar to the colonial gaze, facilitates the reorganization of territories, populations, and plant and animal life into extractible data and natural resources for material and immaterial accumulation.Macarena G\u00f3mez-Barris, The Extractive Zone, p. 5. The extractive view and the colonial gaze rendered entire Indigenous populations invisible in order to define their territories as terra nullius and facilitate the extraction of natural resources from them. Indigenous Peoples have been represented as nonexistent and their land as unexploited wilderness for this very purpose. The day after our Natchez Heritage Tour, Duncan and I accompanied the Anthropocene River Journey students on a visit to the Emerald Mound, located on the Natchez Trace. A National Park Service sign describes the Old Natchez Trace as \u201ca wilderness road that originated from a series of trails used by the southeastern Indian tribes.\u201d Yet, how can a trace shaped for centuries by these tribes, building along this pathway of earthworks such as the Emerald Mound\u2014\u201cthe crowning mound-building achievement\u201d of the Mississippian Indigenous group several thousands years ago and still used today as a sacred site \u2014be considered \u201cwilderness\u201d?",

To Tuhiwai Smith, \u201cfrom the vantage point of the colonized, a position from which I write, and choose to privilege, the term \u2018research\u2019 is inextricably linked to European imperialism and colonialism.\u201dLinda Tuhiwai Smith, Decolonizing Methodologies. Dunedin, New Zealand: University of Otago Press, 1999, p. 1. Indeed, she describes her book as \u201cidentif[ying] research as a significant site of struggle between the interests and ways of knowing of the West and the interests and ways of resisting of the Other.\u201d Tuhiwai Smith continues: In this example, the Other has been constituted with a name, a face, a particular identity, namely indigenous peoples. While it is more typical (with the exception of feminist research) to write about research within the framing of a specific scientific or disciplinary approach, it is surely difficult to discuss research methodology and indigenous peoples together, in the same breath, without having an analysis of imperialism, without understanding the complex ways in which the pursuit of knowledge is deeply embedded in the multiple layers of imperial and colonial practices.Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Decolonizing Methodologies, p. 2. Emphasis in the original. She explains this inextricable link between the pursuit of knowledge and imperial and colonial practice by highlighting the ideal embodied by researchers when they perceive themselves as the natural representatives of an oppressed community or of a greater good for mankind because of the mere fact that they\u2019ve dedicated an academic career to this community or good. Yet, for Tuhiwai Smith, Indigenous Peoples have alternative stories to tell about this very ideal itself, causally linking scientific research to mankind\u2019s benefit: Indigenous peoples across the world have other stories to tell which not only question the assumed nature of those ideals and the practices they generated, but also serve to tell an alternative story: the history of Western research through the eyes of the colonized. [\u2026] From some indigenous perspectives the gathering of information by scientists was as random, ad hoc and damaging as that undertaken by amateurs. There was no difference, from these perspectives, between \u201creal\u201d or scientific research and any other visits by inquisitive and acquisitive strangers.Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Decolonizing Methodologies, p. 3. Remember our Natchez guide\u2019s answer to how undergraduate students, artists, social scientists, and curators could help him to excavate alternative stories? It was with material support. He does not need theater makers or even postcolonial theorists to translate his reenactments into contemporary art or academic idioms. He can\u2014and already does\u2014tell his stories about, with, and for African Americans, as well as to the greater public, alone. What he does need, though, is to be offered symmetrical institutional and financial opportunities as our group received in order to pursue and disseminate his work at the same scale. He needs public funds for collection building and the conservation of the Natchez Museum of African American History and Culture\u2019s archives, he needs time and space to rehearse, he needs cultural sites to invite him and his colleagues to perform their pieces. To consider him in a nonextractive way is to work with him, not to process his story as mere data. While discussing these matters with Bernd Scherer, the director of HKW, I asked him about the relationship of the Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project to the institution\u2019s curatorial history. He explained that the project is looking at a topographic case of the Anthropocene by working with people along the course of the Mississippi River to address issues directly related to the geological hypothesis but that are not necessarily framed in this context. The project links different kinds of initiatives as a way for each to mutually relate to their respective contexts and to develop and support their social and political agendas. He told me that one reason for going to the American South is that the Upper Delta region, specifically, contradicts the old cardinal categories of \u201cthe North\u201d and \u201cthe South.\u201d It is a way for Westerners (in this case, Westerners from Europe, so Easterners for Mississippians) to inquire both about themselves and about themselves in relation to the others. To Scherer, Louisiana, for instance, is a place where the North colonizes itself by fully exploiting its own land and people. So yes, the Anthropocene River Journey was about auto-colonization. When I shared with him my extractive epistemology problematic, he answered: I think if you call wherever you go and are engaging with, or just looking at a certain situation, \u201cextracting,\u201d then maybe the concept is being overused. It depends what your attitude is, the way you are engaged on the ground. The whole project was developed in a way that engaged with people we knew for quite some time. We knew their concerns and they knew ours. It is not a project that is only taking out\u2014it is also giving. Quite a number of initiatives were developed by people directly on the ground. We did not just take things and not give it back. Shooting a film and just showing it at home is different than showing it to the people who are involved and engaging with them.Bernd Scherer, interview with the author via Skype, 2019.",

                "text": "This notion of a particular attitude and reciprocity was indeed obvious during the couple days our group spent alongside the organization Cooperation Jackson after leaving Natchez. The group\u2019s goal is to achieve \u201cself-determination for African Americans through economic self-sufficiency\u201d and \u201chas worked tirelessly to secure and grow its power base within Jackson\u2019s political, educational, and economic institutions and the creation of institutions of its own,\u201d especially through \u201claying the foundation to establish a network of co-ops and initiatives, including housing, daycare, construction, freedom farms, urban farming, and a community land trust.\u201d I\u2019ve taken these words from the descriptions Cooperation Jackson offered during the Field Station 5 broadcast we recorded with them while sharing meals, movies, visits, and discussions about their facilities as well as our common concerns, struggles, and dreams.The broadcast can be listened to here: Abb\u00e9y Odunlami and Jared Richardson, \u201cBroadcasting Live from Field Station 5: Episode 6. Cooperation Jackson &amp; Sustainability Community Development\u201d: https://anthropocene-curriculum.org/contribution/broadcasting-live-from-field-station-5-episode-6 As Scherer reminded me, much of the Anthropocene River project has been completed by people living nearby the Mississippi through radio, film, and theater plays, which they have kept and continue to use in their own contexts. I turn to Tuhiwai Smith here, and her assertion that a decolonizing methodology starts with demystifying and sharing knowledge in a long-term commitment: I use the term \u201csharing knowledge\u201d deliberately, rather than the term \u201csharing information\u201d because to me the responsibility of researchers and academics is not simply to share surface information (pamphlet knowledge) but to share the theories and analyses which inform the way knowledge and information are constructed and represented. By taking this approach seriously it is possible to introduce communities and people who may have had little formal schooling to a wider world, a world which includes people who think just like them, who share in their struggles and dreams and who voice their concerns in similar sorts of ways. To assume in advance that people will not be interested in, or will not understand, the deeper issues is arrogant. The challenge always is to demystify, to decolonize.Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Decolonizing Methodologies, p. 16. When Tuhiwai Smith, writing from the vantage point of the colonized, says that \u201cthe term \u2018research\u2019 is inextricably linked to European imperialism and colonialism,\u201d it causes my abyssal feeling of extractivism in the subdued atmosphere of the Natchez sports bar to slowly become clearer. After this brief reflection, I believe that, as a highly educated European researcher, I write from the vantage point of the colonial world. And maybe it is only after acknowledging this position that I can try to decolonize my methodologies, rather than by trying to hide what is glaringly evident. Following the brief encounters that I have described here, some premises for such reparation emerge, such as building long-term networks to facilitate the production and transmission of alternative stories. Are the curatorial politics of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt part of this long-term knowledge sharing? And as an aspiring ecological researcher and writer analyzing Anthropocenic histories through experiences such as the Mississippi River Journey, am I taking enough care to prevent my work from falling into the extractive tendency of the pursuit of knowledge? To tell alternative stories to the dominant Anthropocene narrative is to start by acknowledging that these stories are already being told, and acknowledging the need of those who tell them for knowledge reparation.",

Meskonsing-Kansan, our imaginative geography, is troubled by Notchininga\u2019s Map, or No Heart\u2019s Map, created in 1837 by the second Iowa chief under White Cloud. Foster explains: \u201cWhen they were negotiating the treaties and the Dakota and the Sac and Fox were competing over their claims in eastern Iowa, one of our chiefs, No Heart, one of my direct ancestors, drew a map from the fork of the Mississippi and Missouri going up, where our villages and places were. In response to the maps that the United States was making, they used a European convention to try to say this is our land, this is where our ancestors were, this is where the burials were, this is how we claim it.\u201d In other words, Notchininga\u2019s map was an assertion of Iowa jurisdiction\u2014articulated in the colonizers\u2019 own visual language. \u201cThis is the route of my forefathers,\u201d Notchininga stated, pointing to a series of dotted lines; \u201cit is the land we have always claimed from old times\u2014we have always owned this land it is ours\u2014it bears our name.\u201dNo Heart\u2019s Map, 1837 (Record Group 75, National Archives and Records Administration.

The THPO is a granted position to do compliance reviews of projects that are scattered throughout our homelands. So if you put up a structure like a water tower, I have to do the research and the studies to make sure it\u2019s not going to disturb ancestral burials or ancestral sites. And I do that work for all nine states, roughly, that we\u2019ve been in before our removal to this place, since the beginning: Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri. All those states, or portions thereof, have sites that are associated with our people, but we also have other sites as far as Manitoba. My tribe doesn\u2019t have a cultural division, and it doesn\u2019t fund one, so all the culture-related things, whether it\u2019s language or NAGPRA, comes down to me to do or not do. That\u2019s why my schedule is pretty tight sometimes. How does this work differ from the reclamation work or memory work you do in your artmaking? Well, I\u2019ve always done this kind of work. When I went back to Montana, I recovered probably close to a dozen boxes of material on the Ioway and our landscape, our language and culture, and my art, material gathered since my teens, and I\u2019m almost 60 now. The biggest part of my life has been about trying to gather this information from different sources and work with it creatively, and portray it. According to tribal tradition, the ancestors of the Ioway Indians united as a people ages ago. The Clans had come together and agreed to become a People, the Honga, the Great Nation. Some clans had come from the Great Lakes. Others had come from the north, from a land remembered as very cold. Others had come from the western prairies or the eastern woodlands. Some of the ancestors had made great mounds in the shapes of animals and birds along the bluffs of the Great River. Others had traded down the River to the great southern mound cities, and came back with new ceremonies, new beliefs to add to the older ones. This development of the Clans into one Nation is traced in the ancient stories and traditions of the Ioway and their brothers, the Otoe, the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), and Missouria. Other relatives of these peoples also seem to have been a part of this Nation, including the Omaha, Ponca, Kansa, Quapaw, and Osage. These stories recall a time when they were all one people. A time when all the land of this Middle Place was theirs. \u2013\u2013Lance M. Foster, \u201cTanji na Che\u201dLance M. Foster, \u201cTanji na Che: Recovering the Landscape of the Ioway,\u201d in Recovering the Prairie, edited by Robert F. Sayre, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1999, 178-190, http://ioway.nativeweb.org/iowaylibrary/tanji.htm   I began to try and understand more about our presence in southwestern Wisconsin and in southeastern Minnesota too, around Red Wing, Lake Pepin, where our strongest identity picks up I would say, once we crossed. There\u2019s an account, I think it was Mahaska or White Cloud\u2019s account, about when we crossed over Lake Pepin, before that there\u2019s only a dim memory of what happened. In our oral tradition we have a pretty good record from the 1800s onwards, before that time there\u2019s bits and pieces, and I\u2019d say right around the 1600s it almost goes right into mythological time. It\u2019s hard; you\u2019ve got time working against you, you\u2019ve got the fact that we\u2019ve suffered catastrophic population loss, with all the loss of memory that goes along with that, and also I would say there\u2019s another factor in that in our warrior tradition, you remember when you win battles, more than when you lose them. For example the story of how the Ioway left southern Minnesota is recorded more in Dakota sources. That\u2019s why I often go to the Dakotas or the Ho-Chunk to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s your memory, what are your traditions on that?\u201d It\u2019s interesting stuff. For example, for Pipestone, all we know is that people weren\u2019t supposed to fight there, that it was part of our area, and then we got pressed south after the 1700\u2019s, when the Yankton were expanding, and they became the guardians of the pipestone after us. But we and the Otoe remember that we were up there and that we were the big traders of pipestone for hundreds of years. There\u2019s the Apache saying, \u201cwisdom sits in places,\u201d where you talk about place as memory. Well, when you take a group of people and remove them from where their memory house was\u2026 their places remind them of these stories, and our stories now since 1836 are mostly here. And I\u2019m shocked at how even many of those stories have faded, with changes in culture.",

                "text": "Can you tell us more about the Leary Site? And can you also talk more generally about what constitutes a sacred landscape? The Leary site is near the mouth of the Nemaha River. It was occupied from about 1200 to 1400, and even in the 1850s and 1860s, but above it are some mounds from the Hopewell, about 3,000 years ago. It was part of a sacred landscape. The bluff by the Nemaha was likely an animal lodge where the animal spirits lived. If you go up to Indian Caves State Park, there is a cave that was probably where the Buffalo spirits lived along the river. The Pawnee are the ones who have the fullest developed memory of that in this area, they call them rahurahwa:ruksti: \u2018u, [\u201c(being) holy ground.\u201d], it is the animal councils who would gather. So the Leary Site was a place where the ancestral Ioway and Otoe along with the ancestral Arikara and Skiri Pawnee lived and traded with each other for probably 200 to 300 years. It was a really important site. If you think of Cahokia as New York and you think Blood Run would be say Chicago, this is like Kansas City. There were probably 3,000 people who lived there at the height. We have done some remote sensing there with LiDAR and found both square earth lodges and burials all over the place. They traded pipestone and buffalo hides; we\u2019re going to have a little exhibit here about it. It\u2019s just an amazing place. Alan Kelley, Tribal Vice Chairman and first THPO said he had a medicine man come to the Leary Site and he said the ancient ones came around him and asked who he was and what he was doing there, and he explained things to them. Even as late as a couple of years ago, we had one of our tribal folks go up there in the winter time and they smelled of cooking food, you know? So it is a living place, for sure. It is said that at one time, the Ioway had such power that a person of another tribe could not make a footprint anywhere in our territory without the Ioway knowing about it immediately, and that none could be here without our permission. This was not because the Ioway were a particularly large tribe, but because we had been, according to our traditions, the first keepers of the Pipestone Quarries in southwest Minnesota, and because we had established a sacred covenant with the many natural forces and spirits who were the First Beings of the Land Between Two Rivers. These forces and spirits were our relatives, and would let us know about anything that was going on in our lands as soon as it happened. \u2026In 1837, Grandfather No Heart defended our ancestral rights to these lands by producing a hand-drawn map showing our many villages and routes of travel. \u2013\u2013Lance M. Foster, \u201cA Closing Circle\u201dLance M. Foster, \u201cA Closing Circle: Musings on the Ioway Indians in Iowa,\u201d in The Worlds Between Two Rivers: Perspectives on American Indians in Iowa, edited by Gretchen M. Bataille, David M. Gradwohl, and Charles L. P. Silet, Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2000, 142-150, http://ioway.nativeweb.org/iowaylibrary/circle.htm   How is the process of restoring the sacred connection with places related to the process of restoring the connection with peoples? Can you talk more about the kinship between Ioway and Ho-Chunk? I\u2019ve talked to Ioways in Oklahoma whose family members married into the Ho-Chunk Winnebago in Wisconsin. So there\u2019s been intermarriages sporadically that continue that kind of tie. I know that the Otoe Missouria have taken a bus load of their seniors to visit the Ho-Chunk up there. There have been a lot of parallel efforts like this. And, of course, in my work as THPO with Bill Quackenbush from Ho-Chunk and Randy Teboe of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska and others, we\u2019re coming at this from a lot of different directions. There\u2019s not a unified or single program. It may come to that, though, because we\u2019re also trying to reaffirm our ancient trading networks in relationships. So it\u2019s, again, a developing thing. It took hundreds of years to be fissioned apart. It\u2019s going to take a while to get it back, but it\u2019s there. And it\u2019s always amazing to me when I hear somebody else\u2019s independent stories about how they\u2019re doing things too. A few days ago, I returned from a celebration held at Effigy Mounds National Monument in northeast Iowa. At the speakers\u2019 table, members of the Ioway, Otoe-Missouria, and Ho-Chunk once more gathered as one people, something that had not happened at this locality for at least 170 years. It was in 1830 that our ancestors gathered across the Nyitanga at Prairie du Chien, to sign one of the treaties that would be used to remove us from these lands where our grandfathers and grandmothers sleep in the graves in the bluffs high above, where the mounds shaped like our Bear and Thunder ancestors cluster and march. We talk about this. We will see. The S\u2019ageh, the Old People, our grandmothers and grandfathers sleeping out there on the bluffs, made that covenant. Even now, perhaps they are guiding their wayward grandchildren to fulfill it once more. Our oldest traditions indicate that many of our clans, such as the Bear, split off from our relatives the Hochungara (Ho-Chunk or Winnebago), whom we also called our fathers or grandfathers, and whom we left behind near Makashuje, Red Banks, on the shores of Lake Michigan in Wisconsin. We left with our sister tribes the Otoe and Missouria, who continued on to search for new lands. This fissioning process appears to have begun very early, perhaps as early as A.D. 700, but was finalized by the 1500s. No one is sure. However, the Ioway continued to visit their relatives the Winnebago, or Ho-Chunk, into historic times. We have always recognized each other as kin. \u2013\u2013Lance M. Foster,\u00a0 \u201cA Closing Circle\u201dFoster, \u201cA Closing Circle.\u201d   We were noticing the stop signs and the street signs in the Ioway language on the reservation, how long have those been up?  Those have been up for three or four years. We have had waves of interest in the language, and at one of those times, one of the students, Sydney Campbell Pursel started to come to classes. She is Emil Campbell\u2019s great granddaughter, and she was going to art school in Lawrence, and she did the signs as a project. She created bumper stickers and signs, and if you drive along the river, there are certain hollows and creeks that have the Ioway names. We saw some connections between the work that she is doing with those signs in asserting Ioway relationships to the land and what you\u2019re doing in your own artwork, and as the THPO for the nation. It\u2019s been a group effort, and we all use our individual knowledge or talents. It\u2019s not any one of us at any time, necessarily, that does all these things. It\u2019s a group mind. Can you speak more about the reservation? Our population is at 400 just around here, we have 4,000 on our rolls, so we have a vast diaspora. During allotment, when the land was divided up, we lost most of our land, by the 1940\u2019s non-Natives owned 90% of the reservation. We bought some of it back. But a lot of tribal members, like my grandparents, had to move away for jobs during World War II. We were divided during the Civil War, the greater number of adult men fought on the side of the North in the Civil War and when they came back the tribe kind of split. Some were tied to their places here, the burial sites, and they wanted to stay, and a lot of the other ones wanted to live more like Indian people did, to have a village and all that, so they moved down to Oklahoma in the 1870s, but by the 1880s they were allotted as well. So we have two groups of Ioway: the northern ones, we are a lot more mixed here, but the part that we have is probably more Ioway. Down south they mix more with the Otoes and the Creeks. So they look more Indian but the language is a little more blended with Otoe. In the tribe there are all these social systems and circles and relationships, and people know who the family gets along with and who they don\u2019t, and all of these generations of memory\u2026It\u2019s entangled.",

                "text": "How does that play out across or between tribes, because you are right next to the Sac and Fox, and also the Kickapoo?  There are some families that go to the Kickapoo School and have relationships there. Families were always visiting back-and-forth. And if it wasn\u2019t for the Potawatomi we would have been terminated in the 1940s. Minnie Evans out of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation led that fight to maintain the tribes. Before, you mentioned perceptions of historical time, and settler society does a lot of work to inscribe its history in the landscape, and to remove the ways that places tell other stories. Up in Wisconsin, in the Kickapoo River Valley, Bill Quackenbush from Ho-Chunk took us and our children around and introduced us to place as story. The stories sounded like they were mythological time, but because they were connected to particular places, were very non-mythologizing. Very vivid right? Very vivid and historical. And material, and political, and there\u2019s lessons that are pertinent to the present and to the future, right? Right. Did you see our lodge outside? Bill Quackenbush helped build it. I\u2019m working on another project with Eric Zingler who is putting together traditions and thinking about the Ocooch Mountains which, you know, is kind of that same region in Wisconsin, and the Kickapoo River Valley has a lot of sites with rock art, some of which are associated with the Oneota culture that we, the Otoe, the Missouria and Ho-Chunk, all branched off of. Those are sacred places to us. We called ourselves Baxoje, Paxoje, Paxoce, etc. Pronounced Bakoche\u2026The Winnebago variant of the name is Wakoche, although they tend to drop the final \u201ce\u201d in normal speech, so they can often say it as Wakoch. The P and W sounds are often said very softly. These names would have been heard by non-Indians and written either as Ocoche or Ocooch. The Oneota\u2026were all over that [Driftless] area, and our earliest sites are as far north as Lake Pepin and Red Wing, over to Effigy Mounds and the Upper Iowa, and La Crosse has all kinds of our sites. We (Ioway, Otoe, Winnebago) lived in this area for centuries before the Sauk and Meskwaki or Kickapoo came there (in the late 1600s or the 1700s, as they left the lands scarred by Iroquois warfare during the Beaver Wars)\u2026The Ocooch area would have been a place for hunting and fishing, but also rituals like vision questing, which is reflected in the rock art (petroglyphs and pictographs) in some of the rock shelters there that show Oneota art. That\u2019s the pattern from about AD 900 to 1670 or so, when the Ioway (wakoch/ocoche) left the area for good, probably due to disease, resource depletion, and increasing war. \u2013\u2013Lance M. Foster, \u201cMountains of Snowy Lodges\u201dLance M. Foster, \u201cMountains of Snowy Lodges &#8211; A Wisconsin Memory\u201d (2013), http://ioway.nativeweb.org/history/mountains_of_snowy_lodges.htm \u00a0 This is something we talked about in March and you\u2019ve written about before, we are thinking about relationships to place between Kansas and a region in Wisconsin now known to most folks as the Driftless, but that was known to many as the Ocooch for a long time. And just thinking about the origins of that word and what that means about relationships to that place in the past and present, I\u2019d love to hear you reflect a little bit more on Ocooch. It\u2019s interesting because there\u2019s a couple of things going on there. the opening vowel might be a derivation of ho. In Ioway and Ho-Chunk there is a distinguishing between vowels if you nasalize or don\u2019t nasalize them\u2013\u2013hon vs ho. Ho I think means fish and hon means voice. So Hon-chungra, that\u2019s nasal, it means the big voice. Kuje means to shoot something, so ho-kuje means to shoot a fish with a bow and arrow. Ho-Chunk close their words with a consonant, so m\u00fanc is their word for bear, we say m\u00fanje. So Ho-kuc, vs Ho-kuje [Ocooch vs Ocoochay]. And then I came across, in a lexical list, that Ocooch was one of the terms for the Wisconsin River and some of the smaller rivers off it. They were traditionally places where our ancestors would spear for fish out of canoes. And then Eric showed me a source that said that this word, Ocooch, was after a people who lived there at one time. So we explored how that would relate to Baxoje. Ci means a house and ba of course, is snowy. And so our word for baxoje means a lot of different things. Like xoje means ashy, it means gray. And then ba either can mean, if you say it ba with a solid B, it means snow. But if you say it with an unaspirated P, pa\u2014unaspirated means there\u2019s no puff of air\u2014it means nose or head. To an English ear it sounds like the same word. So, baxoje or paxoje either it could mean gray snow, ashy snow, gray nose. And then there\u2019s the chee part, like cakirutha, which means the part of the lodge, so \u201csnow on the lodges.\u201d So the question is which does it mean? And I think it\u2019s sort of like the name for ourselves. We don\u2019t know for sure because it was so long ago, and everybody has their apocryphal story that they favor\u2026and we\u2019re all part of the story, there\u2019s not only one right answer, all of these are part of what makes a place name. So if one takes for a certainty that it relates to a people who where there, well, we know the Ho-Chunk were further to the east at that time, and the Ioway were west on that side. And that\u2019s why I was very interested in the Kickapoo Valley name, because the Kickapoo came in after all of us. So that\u2019s really interesting to me on that level. It\u2019s really hard for people to understand. Like when they want to change back Loess Bluffs to Squaw Creek, and white people don\u2019t seem to understand that squaw is a derogatory term, it\u2019s a term that dehumanizes. So, an Indian baby isn\u2019t a baby, it\u2019s a papoose. An Indian woman isn\u2019t a woman, she\u2019s a squaw. An Indian man isn\u2019t a man, he\u2019s a buck. So we\u2019ve got people who mythologize Indians into this kind of never, never land of papooses and squaws and bucks without seeing them as human beings. They either make them into savage devils who they had to wipe out to make room for the white people, or after that chapter is done, then they kind of mythologize them into Hiawatha and the land of Gitche Gumee and sailing on the waters\u2026They never see us as people. So the problem with place names is that people make up \u201cIndian\u201d names for places, and so Ocooch, the Snowy Mountains. What we were trying to do is find how could you come up with this weird settler interpretation of Snowy Mountains with a native term which really means fish spearing waters, a place where you spear fish? And so, we did a bunch of excavation with some of our names for ourselves and some alternatives. The difficulty with talking to non-Indians about this, or even to look at something and discuss things as possibilities, is that, next thing you know, it becomes like that\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s the difficulty we face. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever get out of that because people still see Indians as something separate in the sense of either not quite human or more than human. Yeah, and this seems like a very different conversation between Indians and non-Indians than what you were alluding to earlier with the conversations that you are having with the Ho-Chunk over understandings of relationships to place, which are overlapping and complex. So the conversations you mentioned with Bill and other folks at Ho-Chunk about how they understand Ocooch feels like a very different kind of conversation and conversational space than what you\u2019re describing right now. It is, and it\u2019s something that we hammer out with each other, because you got to remember our cultures were like a multi-thousand piece jigsaw puzzle that somebody came by and knocked off the table. And now we\u2019re scrambling for pieces, and I have this piece and you have that piece, and we\u2019re trying to see how they fit together while somebody is saying, \u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t fit right. No, you got to do this. No, you got to find the edge piece.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cWait a minute, we\u2019re working with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d We\u2019re also thinking about climate disruption and how relationships to place are shifting as places themselves are changing and moving. How do you account for these movements? We are sitting in a space heated by propane, we are using the devices with rare earth minerals. If we wanted to go live in that lodge out there, that canvas is made from something. If we wanted to live the old ways there\u2019s no way you can, because you don\u2019t own the land, there\u2019s not enough deer to support everybody. So we are trapped. People call us hypocrites, because we are trying to address that. But on the other side, which is wind farms, all these alternatives, you\u2019ve got the money machine under that. We have painted ourselves into a corner. You know what a glissade is, when you are mountain climbing and it\u2019s icy, and you do a controlled fall with your ice ax? What we need is an eco-glissade, a controlled fall so that things don\u2019t totally get destroyed. A controlled descent, a controlled contraction. And nobody is talking about that. They are talking about alternate modes of growth. Or sustainability, which is ridiculous because this isn\u2019t sustainable. How American Indians always lived here is population control and learning from our mistakes. The Cheyenne only had one kid traditionally every four years or so. It was imposed that way, the mother breast fed the kids until a certain point, so you kept your population down that way. When you had overkill sometimes a mammoth disappeared. You learned you can\u2019t do that anymore, you let the mothers live, all that stuff. Well, this society does not have the long view. We had a shot in the 1970s with the NEPA and the Clean Air Act, we had a section of the population that tried to do something, but they got swamped. Then people forgot what it looked like when the rivers burn and you can see the air you breathe.",

No, it has to be me and you, and an answer to some extent is everything is alive, everything has its own life force. It doesn\u2019t mean that sometimes you don\u2019t have to kill it in order to eat, and it might kill you to eat too. When you are buried the plant comes out of you, you eat the plant, it\u2019s a cycle right? This building is alive, that tree is alive, you know, there are beings around us, seen and unseen, the invisible ecosystem. My belief is that the earth is alive, and has sentience and agency, that is my hope, that the Mother is going to see and say okay time for the next chapter. Some of our prophecies talk about that, let\u2019s start over again; because I really hope we don\u2019t turn into Venus. If this is a hospice situation, how do you develop compassion, do what you can, and face death with whatever kind of strength you can find. I just feel terrible that we are taking everything else down with us. I think about our ancestors all over the world, like a woman who separated herself from her people, she is out there wondering, trying to find them, and it\u2019s been weeks since she ate anything, always thinking they might be over that hill, maybe that\u2019s the hill, if I can make it to that hill\u2026They\u2019re not there, but there\u2019s a another hill, if I can get to that hiIl\u2026That\u2019s maybe where we\u2019re at. What does decolonization mean in the context of the kind of crisis that you are describing and that I think we are all perceiving? We are all part of a superorganism, me, you, and everybody in the world is waking up on some level, the Mother is trying to find through her children some way forward. The thing you always have to watch out for, is the context in which we live everything is ultimately about money right? So you will find the people who are in your movements will betray you or will try to capitalize off them\u2026Because we are colonized that way, severely colonized. They are trying to commodify everything now. Oh, we won\u2019t destroy that because it does a process for us in order to clean the water, or whatever. \u201cEcosystems services.\u201d Right. Everything is about freaking money. I hate money, I hate money. I am stuck in a debt I will never be able to get out from under. My wife will never get out from under hers. I have to take care of her, she\u2019s not well. I have to take care of her. I am almost going to be 60 years old next year. I am never going to get out from that, there is no way. Other kinds of debt like Wall Street there is a way to get out from under it. But we have a huge generation that is lost. I told kids, rethink going to school, especially if you\u2019re going to have to take out debt, there are ways to learn through the Internet, and through support and mentorship. I think about what happened in 2008. Not only did they commodify, financialise all these housing loans, but they bet against the people&#8230;They\u2019re doing that with all the water now, they\u2019ve already marked out in their little boardrooms who gets what aquifer and all that kind of crap. Nestl\u00e9 is already doing it in a lot of ways. We wanted to ask about the waters here. You are on the Missouri? Nyishuje is what we call it. Nyishuje. It means a turbid or clouded river, it is clouded from the silt. Shuje means smokey, ny\u00ed is water. Nemaha up here means muddy river, so Missouri is not a muddy river, for us it is a turbid river. The land itself was delineated by the rivers, especially the two great rivers, Nyitanga (the Mississippi) and Nyishuje (the Missouri), the life\u2019s blood of the Earth, and the domain of the Ischexi, the Water Monster. Ischexi was pictured as the Water Panther on woven bags, or on bluffs as pictographs, such as the famous Piasa pictograph. Between these two rivers lay the lands the Ioway claimed as their own, threaded with other rivers, and marked by glacial hills, marshes, tall grass prairies, and ancient woodlands. \u2013\u2013 Lance M. Foster, \u201cThe Ioway and the Landscape of Southeast Iowa\u201dLance M. Foster, \u201cThe Ioway and the Landscape of Southeast Iowa,\u201d Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society 43 (1996), 1-5, http://ioway.nativeweb.org/iowaylibrary/seiowa.htm   We were thinking about why in English at the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers the resulting river is named the Mississippi? And how as a result we think of them as separate rivers, that only flow in one direction. Yes, they say that when they flow together, the black part of the river was the Nyitanga which is the Mississippi and the light green part was the Nyishuje, the Missouri, and they flowed together for miles until they blended and mixed together. Historically, the Ioways always located their villages on major rivers: the Iowa River and the Upper Iowa River (both appropriately named for their use as residences of the Ioway), the Mississippi River, and the Missouri River. Even today on their reservation lands, the Ioway maintain this riverine settlement pattern, with the Ioway of Kansas on the Nemaha and Missouri Rivers, and the Ioway of Oklahoma on the Cimarron River. \u2013\u2013Lance M. Foster, \u201cTanji na Che\u201dFoster, \u201cTanji na Che.\u201d   We were looking at all the waterways in this part of Kansas, and all the small impoundments, thousands of them, everywhere. Yes, and there\u2019s a drought going on, and this year on the\u00a0 reservation they\u2019ve had five wells into the aquifer go dry that were never dry before. Some people get water from creekside, but mostly it\u2019s from pocket aquifers and wells. Along the river road there\u2019s a place where they had damned up some springs to make a little pond and they\u2019ve dug deeper and deeper there about 15 feet down now and there\u2019s only a trickle of water going through it, and it was gushing before\u2026 Even here in a pretty moist environment, we used to grow corn without irrigation, but they make more corn if you irrigate more. The terracing was started in the \u201830s, now they put the tile through it so you don\u2019t need a waterway, you get more bushels of corn. And along the creeks there used to be a buffer, we had brush along the road and between roads, but with corporate farming it\u2019s all sprayed and mowed, and now they\u2019re just single trees along the creek, there\u2019s no buffer strip anymore. And what happens as the trees fall in, there\u2019s no trees, they bulldoze that and put a pipe through it, so you get it rid of creeks that way too. There is an extraordinary amount of pressure on the waters, and it\u2019s not one single thing, it is incremental&#8230; And cumulative. How do we visualize or describe this, when these points of extraction and contamination are so dispersed, and each one individually does not seem like much? I think if you can help people understand, just like Bill Quackenbush did, take the kids out there, if you can stoke people\u2019s curiosity: why is it like this, why is it not like that, what happened, what kind of plant is that, is that a plant on a poison-edible spectrum? Because if you use too much of a medicine it becomes poison, a little bit of poison becomes medicine. So how do you encourage complexity and curiosity in people\u2019s thinking? The elements of this land were the great Powers, the Day, the Night, the Winds, the Winter. Although the Big Male Winter, the time of glaciers, had been killed by Mischinye, the Great Hare, long ago, the land still bore the scars of that glacial age, and the Small Female Winter still returned every year with her bitter winds. The great rivers were connected by overland trails through the upland prairie. In marshy country, the glacial eskers and ridges provided relatively dry travel for people and buffalo. One such trail that is recorded in historic French maps was the one which led from the Ioway village on the Mississippi, across the marshy glacial plain of north-ern Iowa, to their villages on Okoboji and Spirit Lakes, and thence through the loess hills to their village on the Missouri River (Mott Wedel 1986). Although a detailed study has not been made of this route, I strongly suspect they used glacial landforms such as eskers on at leastparts of the trail where they provided drier passage across marshy terrain, as well as following the roads made by the buffalo herds.10 \u2013\u2013Lance M. Foster, \u201cTanji na Che\u201dFoster, \u201cTanji na Che.\u201d   Can you speak more about Ioway glacial stories? We, also the Ho-Chunk and most other tribes, have a mythological time, which was ancient Madadanyida, some call it, the time before time. And this was a time when there were monsters on the earth. They were close to wiping out mankind. And we had a series of heroes that came to earth that fought them so mankind could survive without being threatened. Some of these monsters were like giants, for example, that ate human beings. Some were weird ancient animals that also ate human beings or killed them. And some of this seems to have happened during a time of great cold, during a glacial period. Different tribes have different stories. And that\u2019s part of the other recovery of our culture is to find these stories again and began telling them, not just in a book, but to have active storytelling. These stories and this sort of knowledge seems very relevant. We talked about this a lot in March, this kind of long-term knowledge and memory of changing climates, I don\u2019t know if you think about it differently or value it differently given the climate disruption that we are experiencing today? I do, and, in fact, I\u2019m kind of engaging with some folks from New Zealand and Australia around that. You have Traditional Ecological Knowledge which was passed down in oral history and traditions in all of our communities. And we each have different aspects to it and each live in different places. But then we have parts of Western society, like conservation science, which is trying different avenues of preservation. Like Rewilding North America, which is the idea to bring back connections between wild places so that nature becomes nature through its own processes again. We don\u2019t try to impose our ways on nature, but recover itself. So this Re-Wilding Iowa project I\u2019m doing at Effigy Mounds with five other Ioway artists is referring to aspects of Western conservation about corridors, carnivores and cores, refuges, different places that you connect through river corridors. And then you bring that together with Traditional Ecological Knowledge about what animals and plants should be there, how they interact with each other throughout the year. That\u2019s one major direction I\u2019m going in currently. I\u2019m also on a joint Indigenous Climate Task Force to try to see what we can bring to the table, because it\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to stop it by putting in windmills and stuff at this time. I think people are going to change their behavior, but how can we survive? Just like in the ancient times of glaciers, only it\u2019s going the other way now. What can we learn from our traditions about how to survive the changes that are coming? Your idea of eco-glissade, which we talked a lot about in March, was really fascinating. Then what you\u2019re describing too, these green river corridors in relation to rewilding seems like it\u2019s an understanding of the sort of land and territory that No Heart communicated in the map. That\u2019s significant there. As you were talking about the importance of telling these stories, I was curious about the significance of telling them in place, if that is something that you see as important, as a way of renewing relationships or establishing new relationships with places. I think that\u2019s very important. I think that\u2019s a common thread that most cultures around the world have, that speaking is part of our creative power as human beings. It\u2019s the breath of life that we have that is shaped by our mouths and our intentions and our thinking into stories. And if you tell those stories in the places you\u2019re trying to help heal, it is like a creation myth that you\u2019re making right there in that place, and maybe correcting it and bringing it back to a form of life that it needs to have. And I think that\u2019s how we can help people reconnect with places, is to tell stories of those places that are compatible with what the place needs to become.",

However, there seems to be an essential difference between the interactions of living beings, and those between man and machine. How are the new electronic assistants interacting with us? What is their nature and role in times of existential danger and matters of sheer survival? Can their advanced but uncertain knowledge finally be described as an essential quality, as proof of superiority, intelligence and virtue justified through their pure mathematical structure? Or does this technology remain a mathematical axiom?cf. the philosophical battle of Erich H\u00f6rl and Dieter Mersch concerning inter alia the essence of digital technologies and its mathematical foundation. \u201cWie die technische Gegenwart verstehen.

Akademie der K\u00fcnste, Schwindel der Wirklilchkeit. 6.11.2014, Youtube (posted February 20 2015),\u00a0online Is it simply illustrating an elegant compensation for an all so apparent shortage caused by the disregard of the region&#8217;s fragile topography and disastrous environmental history, by building, and overall building poorly on earthquake prone land, a land in which future urban catastrophes inevitably accumulate? A deficiency that also results from the psychological bias towards uncertainty and the disproportionate role of unpredictable events of low probability with high impact, that are far beyond the realm of normal expectations.cf. Mike Davis,\u00a0Ecology of fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster, New York: Vintage Books, 1999 Furthermore we need to speak of sovereign action; a trade regarded as highly characteristic of human beings; but what does this notion mean in a time where digital devices are taking more and more control of our lives, and taking over parts of human decision-making processes? Lastly, we need to ask if it is possible to detect and sense the dangers and unanticipated consequences that stem from the mere participation in these technologically regulated practices and primal demands of the application. To issue an instruction A countdown is a time sequence of backward counting, to indicate and speak aloud the critical time remaining before an anxiously anticipated event occurs. The temporal demands and necessities of the situation enable a rhetoric that defers any discussion, detail, or story,cf. Thomas O. Sloane, Encyclopedia of Rhetoric, vol. 1. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 415 and thus only functions as an instruction and a strategy to turn the argument in favor of decisive action just in the nick of time. It\u2019s one thing to have an application that is able to understand your commands and instructions. However, it\u2019s something entirely different to have your application actually give you spoken instructions as a speaker, placing as much emphasis on understanding and recognizing you as a person as on what it says about the situation, in the face of the danger. In the nick of time, the truth and impact of the argument to be enunciated are situated not only in what is said but also in how it sounds. Just as the voice was once divided into the words we say and the way we say them, issuing the appropriate instruction means recognizing and mimicking the two different testimonies that come from one person\u2019s speech.cf. Lawrence Abu Hamdan, \u201cContra Diction: Speech against itself,\u201d Technosphere x Knowledge, Haus der Kulturen der Welt (audio essay), 2016, online \u201cThe one testimony on behalf of language [which chooses the words], and the other testimony that speaks on behalf of the body,\u201dAbu Hamdan, \u201cContra Diction.\u201d which conveys an intention that is audible through the nonverbal emphasis in the voice brought out in the spoken words.c. f. Abu Hamdan, \u201cContra Diction.\u201d Attentive to the countdown is an application that delivers and embodies the perfect timing and that speaks the proper words, issued, essentially, with the ideal tone, where one appeal needs to be prioritized over another. A compelling voice that retains expression, emphasis, and emotion with the exact quantum of sweetness and softness that is appropriate to your mental state and your physiological condition of stress. Or another voice, resolute and harsh, that might build up a certain kind of tension that is able to push you into action. Before our algorithms get to know your testimonies in more detail, which is necessary to mimic and embody your ideal guide, we will provide you with our axioms. A preset text, or a text-to-speech choice, that guides you through the argument. To prepare you. It transmits our technological systems and codes, our facts and fictions operating and anticipating in the background, to capture and properly instruct the countdown to the earthquake to which you are exposed. Seismic city In the deep subsurface, the earthquake\u2019s forces travel through the tectonic plates until they tear into the bedrock underneath your city, where they will pass over into the structural foundations and domestic walls of your building; and where the resisting forces of constructed matter are at their very weakest, the earthquake might crack the columns and concrete slabsEyal Weizman: \u201cIntroduction: Forensis\u201d.

The fast-growing megacities, created in recent decades by humankind, have increased the threat of an urban earthquake. These cities are located all over the world, with an unexpected preference for plate boundaries. As we are living in the age of construction on our planet, earthquakes that did not have very much impact before will shake urban agglomerations with millions of people in the future. Large parts of these settlements have no earthquake resistance and no strict building codes have been applied. They are rubble in waiting. In fact, for many there is no plan and no hope of fixing them before they collapse. These cities have become a neglected weapon of mass destruction, and an epicentral hit on such a megacity has the potential to kill a million people. Actually, it is not the earthquakes that kill, the buildings do.cf. Nicholas Ambraseys and Roger Bilham, \u201cCorruption Kills,\u201d Nature, vol. 469 (2011), online.Democracy Now, \u201cSeismologist Roger Bilham: \u2018In Recent Earthquakes Buildings Have Acted as Weapons of Mass Destruction\u2019,\u201d Democracy Now (posted 1 March 2010), online. The supreme moment However, there are moments in which your survival could be future-proofed. Moments which are signified by having the right knowledge; a knowledge that incorporates the very environment, deep inside where the actual situation is taking place. Presented at the right moment, voiced at the right time.\u201cKairos,\u201d Wikipedia When the earthquake starts to transmit two kinds of waves of different speeds and strengths, a favorable time difference is created for city-dwellers. This is the moment of the theoretical alert. This alert is based on the efficient early-onset registering and de-noising of the primary p-wave signals and fully automated analysis of the information they carry. This is the first evidence of a quake that seismometers can detect. Automatic phase-picker algorithms are trimmed on identifying the changes in some of the characteristics of incoming p-wave signals, such as the energy, wavelet coefficient, frequency content, and signal amplitude.E. Buforn et al., \u201cThe ALERT-ES Project: An earthquake early warning system for S. Iberia,\u201d Fifteenth World Conference on Earthquake Engineering (15 WCEE), Lisbon (2012): p. 5, online.  The fast-traveling p-waves that the earthquake produces generally do little damage. They make it to the surface before the arrival of the slower but more damaging s-waves, the low-frequency waves that bring the destructive forces; when the shaking gets serious. The latter are the gut-wrenching movements that crush buildings and create landslides. The p-wave-based alert of the theoretical arrival of the s-waves anticipates the strength and location of the ground shaking and its onset time, and offers a few seconds for rescue. A few seconds that vary depending on the underground liquid and solid structures, and your distance from the source of the earthquake.M. Picozzi et al., \u201cApplications of Low-cost, Wireless, Self-organising System (SOESEWIN) to Earthquake Early Warning and Structural Health Monitoring,\u201d in: Friedemann Wenzel and Jochen Zschau (eds.), Early Warning for Geological Disasters: Scientific methods and current practice. Berlin: Springer Verlag (2014): pp. 263\u201388; also online. In this special moment of warning, KAIROS will mediate a vision beyond your experience and cognition; in advance, it will know and tell you what is the right way to act and navigate through the time and space left to you. An instruction that is closely aligned to your character and constitution, ensuring that KAIROS takes full advantage in this supreme moment. Inside the future In the past decades, the main forms of the city on Earth have become the super-city and megacity. These growing cities are challenged by the fact that, in the future, the performance of megacities will interface with the performance of mega-earthquakes; the space and the city itself have transformed and become spaces capable of sensing. Now, the city is embedded with innumerable sensory devices and objects underground and on the surface; equipped with MEMS accelerometers, cameras, RFIDs, and GPS that carry the signals of an accelerating ground. Boreholes, civil structures, building walls, furnishings, commodities, mobile phones, contact lenses, implants, and an infinitely expanding number of consumer and communication devices contribute to the composition of an advanced, real-time structural and spatial monitoring of an increasingly refined grid. This cyber-physical system is incorporating \u201coff the shelf sensor, processing, and communication components into low cost sensing units.\u201dPicozzi et al., \u201cApplications of Low-cost, Wireless, Self-organising System (SOESEWIN).\u201d All sensing units communicate with each other via wireless links, and the seismic data are streamed in real time to huge data centers worldwide using the network of the Internet, the Internet of a billion things.cf. Dino Bindi et al., \u201cOn-site Early Warning System for Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan),\u201d Annals of Geophysics, vol. 58, no. 1 (2015): p. 1, online. \u201cSince each single sensing unit has computing capabilities, software for data processing is installed to perform decentralized (self-organized) actions. In particular, each sensing unit can perform event detection task and run software for on-site early warning.\u201dBindi et al., \u201cOn-site Early Warning System.&#8221; This information is then used in appropriate ground motion prediction equations to estimate the amount of shaking at your specific target location. KAIROS earthquake early warning system, however, does not stop with the estimation of the amount of ground shaking that the target location may expect in the seconds or tens of seconds to come. Considering the interior composition and equipment of the building, special sensor-equipped devices stamp critical paths or positions on the site, to indicate escape routes. When this knowledge is uploaded to the sensing units, together with monitoring data and descriptions of the vulnerability of building structures, these pieces of information can be exploited to calculate the expected probability of damage using the early-warning protocol, customized for your structure and location. A manifest of the powerful science behind quakes. The early-warning alert that is issued and its subsequent instructions are then sent by modern communication means, thereby exploiting the much greater speed of electromagnetic signals over seismic waves.Bindi et al., \u201cOn-site Early Warning System.\u201d Enclosures and openings Once the anticipated disaster shifts from a permanent state of possibility and virtuality into reality, then there is no longer any time left for communications about risk (uncertainties). What is required now is immediate decision-making and reaction to confront the already approaching danger. As you are not able to discern the earthquake\u2019s time signals, KAIROS\u2019s first task is to prompt you with an early alarm-warning of the seconds left to decide and act. And now you might suddenly become aware that you find yourself in an unfamiliar location, in a site entered for the first time, a facility of unknown vulnerability and history. Suddenly surrounded by intense objects, powerful materials of unprecedented dynamics that might tear into you, enclosing any further access to life. What if concrete slabs get weaponized and pancake? No matter if their collapse occurs partially or fully, they will transform the space into a matter of survival. In an earthquake that hits you without any early warning, your first impulse may be to run outside. \u201cBut, counterintuitive as it may sound, experts warn against that since people are too often killed by falling debris as they try to escape.\u201dTim Padgett, \u201cHow to Survive an Earthquake: Two schools of thought,\u201dTime Magazine (posted February 1, 2010), online. \u201cMost people injured (or killed) in earthquakes have moved more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) during the shaking.\u201dcf. Damon P. Coppola, Introduction to International Disaster Management.Burlington, MA: Elsevier, 2007, p. 244. To immediately shield yourself from falling chandeliers, the \u201cDrop and Cover\u201d approach\u2014a recommendation from, for example, the American Red Cross\u2014may not be incorrect when applied in the United States, Santiago de Chile, or Tokyo, where improved construction has greatly reduced the likelihood of structures imploding.Rocky Lopes, \u201cAmerican Red Cross Response to \u2018Triangle of Life\u2019 by Doug Copp,\u201d American Red Cross National Headquarters (posted September 11, 2004), online. But \u201cthe American Red Cross, being a US-based organization, does not extend its recommendations to apply in other countries.\u201dLopes, \u201cAmerican Red Cross Response.\u201d What works there may not work elsewhere, so there is no dispute that the \u201cSurvivable Void Identification Method\u201d or the \u201cTriangle of Life,\u201d which refer to pockets of survivability inside collapsed structures, may indeed be the best things to aim for in other countries where the risk of building collapse, even in moderate earthquakes, is great.Lopes, \u201cAmerican Red Cross Response.\u201d Given that people have only seconds to react to an earthquake following an early-warning alert, the navigation system of KAIROS constitutes an ideal area of application with an immense opportunity for rescue in locations with heavy risk of buildings collapsing. Residents or visitors in cities such as Karachi, Tehran, Bogot\u00e1, or Istanbul may sometimes forget about the cities\u2019 long history of informal construction and high local corruption index, both of which create a major seismic risk.cf. Ambraseys and Bilham, \u201cCorruption Kills.\u201d Fatalism kills. Short-term thinking kills. But, above all, corruption kills. Most people may not even be aware that, according to Transparency International,See transparency.org. the most corrupt sector worldwide is the construction industry.Danny Myers, Construction Economics: A new approach. Abingdon: Routledge, 2013, p. 237; Out-Law.com, \u201cConstruction Sector Worst for Corruption, Report Says,\u201d Out-Law.com (posted November 4, 2011). So where will the openings be, the life-saving triangles, the safe voids to be reached before you are crushed to death? How does one develop a coordinate system and decide in the twinkling of an eye which is the right way to turn and the right location? To adapt your attitude and thinking to an environment that will transform spatially and temporally at an accelerated rate, causing a variety of different kinds of damage? How do you navigate through an n-dimensional field of danger? Your KAIROS application is the fundamental niche. It is the hypervolume that senses the multidimensional space for dangers, and for resources available for survival.\u201cEcological Niche,\u201d Wikipedia,online KAIROS\u2019s setup of algorithmic sensibility and its capability to instantly anticipate dangerous dynamics modify your perception of the environment.Stephane Grumbach and Olivier Hamant, \u201cDigital Revolution or Anthropocenic Feedback?,\u201d &lt;hal-01227303&gt;, 2015, p. 8, online. Curious learning algorithms manage the always remaining uncertainty of knowledge through constant inductive adaptation and feedback from your behavior and the behavior of your environment.Orit Halpern et al., \u201cTest-bed Urbanism,\u201d Public Culture, vol. 25, no. 2 (2013): p. 294, online. An independent decision-making and implementation system centralizes all resources: the knowledge gained from the estimated shaking, the theoretical s-wave onset, the monitoring fabric, and the descriptions of the structural vulnerability and interior composition. It revolves around a basic risk assessment, a classification setup that mainly evaluates the possible types of adverse effects and intensities that are performed by all entities\u2014structures, objects, and people\u2014and the probability of damage at your target location in the upcoming shaking. Your danger An earthquake will transfer and spread its energy and intensity over the entire surface layer. However, depending on where you reside, your individual exposure to an earthquake will generate a highly specific and individual scenario of danger; and ultimately, the person you are will essentially affect your survivability and the consequences of the danger you are in. Therefore, on top of everything described so far, the decision making process of KAIROS incorporates an overarching individual footprint. A first set up will establish personalized mean thresholds for the decision making implementation system. The set up includes accessing your medical records according to a detailed assessment of your physical and mental condition, executed by our medical experts. As a result, your navigation instructions will also vary depending on your physical and mental conditions, and skills. A mobility impairment, advanced age, a physical disability, a wheelchair, a lower level of fitness, an infant, or a tendency to panic would prompt an instruction that is distinct from that received by a practitioner of extreme sports. Extraordinary accuracy is necessary when making decisions over risky passages, where you absolutely should not get stuck when the shaking starts. For example, stairs are a part of the building likely to cause or suffer a lot of damage. People who get onto the stairs are often chopped up by the stair treads and are horribly mutilated.David Mikkelson, \u201cTriangle of Life: Does a \u2018Triangle of Life\u2019 article provide good advice about earthquake safety?,\u201d Snopes.com (posted March 31, 2014), online. Now, in the final decision-making process, special evolutionary algorithms are entering the stage of the test\u2014bed stage. They are trained precisely, using the monitored data of your daily routines and your smartphone-based activities, tracking routes and mental states. Enriched by your personalized data histories, the algorithms are now assigned to calculate and decide about reasonable deviations from the critical mean thresholds. In addition to the personal data histories, they will incorporate into their decision-making the anticipated shaking and the theoretical arrival time of the s-waves, the whole damage risk-assessment, your GPS position, and the real-time monitoring of your physical and mental conditions in the countdown to the earthquake. We use eye-implanted sensors, eye projectors, and eye cameras\u2014RFIDs, which are the required implants\u2014to provide our algorithms with significant information by measuring GPS, sight direction, gestures, camera view (mimicking your own view), and significant body variables and variations such as blood pressure and temperature. This kind of monitoring and calculation is required to optimize and control your route, condition, and velocity at any given step in the countdown. KAIROS: this relational device crucially opens up new perspectives and alters the range of resources for your survival. Into the blue Actually navigating people using data algorithms in dangerous territories becomes a brilliant but also a risky undertaking. In the age of digital navigation, one complex and crucial element in avoiding catastrophe is putting the right color in the right place. Selecting the appropriate color space to capture the dimensions of optimal human visual perception. Here, extraordinary effects can be achieved by building on the cutting-edge solutions of KAIROS\u2019s color choice and conversion algorithms, although adding colors and tones slightly inaccurately or even indiscriminately to the graphics could spoil the communicative aim completely.Birgit Schneider, \u201cRed Futures: The colour red in scientific imagery of climate change,\u201d in: Monica Juneja and Gerrit Jasper Schenk (eds.),Disaster as Image: Iconographies and media strategies across Europe and Asia. Regensburg: Schnell and Stiner, 2014, p. 192. And that could have catastrophic consequences. The app comes up with a mimetic base map of your on-site territory, provided by the real-time camera view from your mobile device or your implanted eye camera. This interface is then overlaid with a four-dimensional navigation diagram in the form of a heat(color)map, which responds interactively to your status. The heat(color)map is used to associate statistical values of adversity with positions or regions in space. This digital navigation system will pop up on your mobile or implanted eye display at the moment the first early-warning alarm arrives. What has to be emphasized here is that, when color-coding data, we are not dealing with the myth of pure objective scientific tools to convey neutral knowledge anymore. Putting the right color in the right place means being aware of and having the capability to control the ambiguous character of data visualizations and their potential to simultaneously combine evidence and speculation with emotional factors; this could leave the door open to deception and illusion. A precarious status\u2014and one, by the way, that applies to every scientific representation\u2014especially when dealing with danger and risk.Schneider, \u201cRed Futures,\u201d cf. p. 185. The color red plays an extraordinary role here. Conventionally seen as the key color for highlighting and affirming, red awakens a heightened degree of attention and meaning that triggers various interpretations.Schneider, \u201cRed Futures,\u201d cf. p. 192. Intense red could signal warning, deviations from a norm, or the delivery of disastrous news, provoking visions of the apocalypse.Schneider, \u201cRed Futures,\u201d cf. p. 186. It is the color with the most obviously alarming character, as opposed to blue. And, therefore, it can simply be seen as the only intuitive way to code danger symbolically, and \u201cas a modern way of depicting disaster.\u201d Schneider, \u201cRed Futures,\u201d p. 185. Here, \u201cthe relation of colour and meaning is not arbitrary or metaphorical, but directly follows a perception common in nature,\u201dSchneider, \u201cRed Futures,\u201d p. 191. such as the red hot of the burning fire. To summarize, red conveys the perception of danger and action at the same time. Here also lies the problem. When strongly directing attention to the notion of destruction, the coding of red could evoke a feeling of sheer powerlessness and fear; instead of prompting a straightforward reaction, it might simply paralyze.Schneider, \u201cRed Futures,\u201d cf. p. 192. Because of the potential problem of misdirecting attention and creating a sense of confusion, panic, or paralysis, the different meanings of the color red have to be weighed up and implemented carefully.Schneider, \u201cRed Futures,\u201d cf. p. 192. In the navigation process, KAIROS\u2019s visualization algorithms will govern the correct reaction by promoting the color red as either the intuitively perceived route to avoid, or the route to aim for. Respecting and exploiting the ambiguity of red as a sign of danger that attracts and repels at the same time. The KAIROS visualization algorithms calculate the color ramps and shadings in real time according to the statistical values of anticipated damage along the escape route, in balance with your color presets and the on-site time delays during the countdown, always monitoring the quality of color adjustment. So, the color mapping of your territory is a process of constant versioning, and, while constantly adapting in real time, the procedure has to decide between the two main mapping and perception styles. The first mapping style pops up if red is your color of immediacy, emphasis, and highlight. This is put into practice by favoring a color palette characterized by small, enclosed areas of an extreme red color. It creates expressive and clear visual patterns on a plan, patterns that attract your attention immediately by using your color for messages and affirmation. It is the color you will follow intuitively. However, if your heightened sensibility to red equates the color with danger and evasion, a second navigation display is provided that provokes the opposite effect, by drawing a map shaded with unrelieved red over large areas adjacent to each other. These are the key danger zones that you will avoid and repel instinctively. Pushing you away, where the path to be followed now tilts into the blue.Schneider, \u201cRed Futures,\u201d cf. p. 192.

Elaborate markers, smooth paving and an array of heritage tourism amenities betray a flush of recent investment in this 63 mile stretch of road running south to north between the towns of Leavenworth and White Cloud, following the west bank of the Missouri River on the Kansas side. The brochure for the byway notes that \u201cthe Glacial Hills Scenic Byway gets its name from the rolling hills and rock-strewn valleys of Northeast Kansas carved by ancient glaciers,\u201d and it also narrates \u201cthe earliest days of pioneer settlement of Kansas along the Missouri River.\u201d We stop at Iowa Point in front of three signs staged in a concave arrangement. Our view from here is meant to echo the panoramic image that stretches across the bottom of the signs: a view across the Missouri floodplain to the river and bluff of the opposite bank. It\u2019s a clunky and somewhat anxious device designed to situate us spatially within what experience designers like to call a viewshed\u2014a structured field of attention meant to enable particular readings of landscape and waterscape. But at Iowa Point the channel of the Missouri river curves 400 or 500 feet away from the Scenic Byway, and the bluffs are barely visible above the elevated roadway between us and the water. Instead of the river we are facing a levee. The first panel is titled: \u201cAncient ice sheets shaped northeast Kansas\u2019 landscape.\u201d Northeast Kansas is defined here as a region by glaciation and it\u2019s (residual) matter\u2014glaciers (\u201csome of the earth\u2019s largest moving objects\u201d), erratics (\u201crocks carried by advancing glaciers from South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota and left here after their retreat\u201d), loess (\u201ca windblown silt created by the movement of glaciers\u201d which is \u201cespecially fertile\u201d and \u201cideal for agriculture\u201d), and a series of agricultural commodities that are \u201cas a result\u201d of the loess soils (corn, soybeans, wheat, hay, sorghum, dairy milk and cattle). This is the \u201cyou are here\u201d part of the trilogy, an orientation that is as much about space as it is about time. And this \u201chere\u201d is carved by glacial westward advances beginning over 600,000 years ago during the Independence Ice Age\u2014named after Independence Creek, located a few miles south, which itself was named by Lewis &amp; Clark on July 4, 1804 when they paused to formally mark what is famously known as \u201cthe first Independence Day in the West\u201d. Before it was called the Independence, the glaciation was called the Kansan, named after the state which itself was named after a French and then English phonetic mistranslation of the name of a people forcefully displaced from here by the United States beginning in 1825. Scientific models developed in Wisconsin, where glacial deposits are younger and better preserved, were subsequently applied to construct a theoretical model for the Kansan, where extensive post-glacial erosion made stratigraphic study and periodization more difficult. But in the 1980s, the Kansan model was invalidated by new dating technologies, leaving what geologist James Aber described as \u201ca void in the scientific knowledge,\u201d which of course called for a new map and theory. \u201cThe Independence formation is herein proposed as a lithostratigraphic unit\u2026,\u201d a model of stratigraphic relations (layer sequence) of different lithologies (inventories of mineral properties) dating the glaciation at 1,000,000-9,000,000 years ago. \u201cThe Independence Formation contains fragments of granite, rhyolite, gneiss, greenstone, gabbro, iron formation, amphibole, tourmaline, garnet, and other erratics derived from the Canadian Shield. This is the key criterion for recognizing the Independence Formation. The presence of Sioux Quartzite cobbles and boulders as well as other erratics of northern origin is also a diagnostic.&#8221;James Aber, \u201cThe Glaciation of Northeastern Kansa,\u201d Boreas 20 (1991), 279-314. The name Independence was itself formally abandoned by the Kansas Geological Survey in 2006 when the lower deposits were found to have reverse polarity and dated at more than 2 million years old\u2014stratigraphic time and geologic age could not be reconciled by the model. But the name Independence stuck and gained prominence in vernacular use, and was formally adopted by the Kansas Scenic Byways Program as part of a regional economic development plan based on automobile tourism. The second panel at Iowa Point is titled \u201cLandscape of the Glacial Hills: Glaciers create lakes, rivers and fertile soil for Kansas settlers.\u201d Glaciers explicitly beckon settlement and industrial agriculture; the land comes into being as settler property claims to be actualized in the future, awaiting valorization through the mastery of white men. The panel also includes schematic drawings of the Independence lithostratigraphy and in-depth descriptions of the \u201cmost notable Kansas bluff overlooking the Missouri, and one of the 8 Wonders of Kansas Geography\u201d: the Four-State lookout just south of Iowa Point. From here, the visitor can behold the view that confirms the interlinked settler geology: \u201cfour states, the river, the farmland and the rolling hills.\u201d The third panel, \u201cThe Barns of Doniphan County: an all-purpose barn for the Kansas farmer\u201d redefines the region through the byre and bluff barn, a place-making technology through which \u201cpeople who settled this scenic part of our state\u201d adapted the glacial hills topography to the imperatives and logistics of industrialized agriculture. A scenic drive provides material evidence and affective anchoring for this narrative arc. \u00a0 Relations The racial categorization of Blackness shares its natality with mining in the New World, as does the material impetus for colonialism in the first instance. This means that the idea of Blackness and the displacement and eradication of Indigenous peoples get caught and defined in the ontological wake of geology. The human and its subcategory, the inhuman, are historically relational to a discourse of settler-colonial rights and the material practices of extraction, which is to say that the categorization of matter is a spatial execution of place, land and person cut from relation through geographic displacement.  \u2013\u2013Kathryn YusoffKathryn Yusoff, A Billion Black Anthropocenes or None, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2018.   In the quiet of a deep winter freeze, geology\u2019s colonial thirst reverberates as it fractures Indigenous place, making erratic and making \u201cIndian\u201d in its wake. Sioux, after an English version of a French version of a Native name, both Indian and rock, made a diagnostic of geology\u2019s \u201cgeopolitical mattering,\u201d of racialized dismemberment of and from place. The Kansan and Independence stabilize and cohere settlement as the \u201cnatural\u201d logic of geologic progression. Kansan glaciers and Kansa Indians resonate as what Jodi Byrd names \u201ccultural and political modes of \u2018Indianness\u2019 regulated and produced by US settler imperialism.\u201dJodi A. Byrd, The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011, xv. Glaciers and Indians are animate but not human, not alive or agentic, but thing-like, productive only in their retreat. Glacial progeny\u2014soil, rocks, minerals, waterways, commodity crops\u2014are left neither knowing nor remembering, neither alive nor dead, an inventory of properties to be animated as settler property.Yusoff, 6. But settler property in land, settler political authority and market-oriented agriculture required\u2014and continue to require\u2014the violent disruption of Indigenous modes of relation to land and Indigenous sovereignties. \u201cNortheast Kansas\u201d names a territorial counter-formation, a set of counter-relations, produced against Indigenous sovereignties and modes of relation which are continuously disrupted and denied. This ongoing violence involves vacating glaciers, land, water, rocks, animals, plants, and Indians of liveness, agency and memory, and the ongoing denial of these realities by settler society. To arrive at these signs, to be addressed by them, is to be drawn into a violent, extractive mode of relation which is both organized, and effaced, as glacial\u2014regulating the relationship between life and nonlife, between agentic and inert, between human and subhuman and nonhuman, through conquest, property and possession. At Iowa Point, the making of settler property claims, of modes of relation centered on capitalized land, \u201cprovides the baseline for the unfolding of time itself.\u201dMark Rifkin, Beyond Settler Time: Temporal Sovereignty and Indigenous Self-Determination, Durham and London, Duke University Press, 2017, 2. Like the glaciers, like settlement and industrial agriculture, time advances implacably westward. The experience of time, of the present moment, of transformation and motion, of being in place, of the making of the earth and its possible futures, become regulated by the calculations of settlement\u2014capitalization, property, allotment, inheritance, development, logistics. Capital claims of the past claim us as kin through succession and inheritance, a claim and inheritance that is both ahistorical and timeless, that can extend in perpetuity. This countertemporality is settler deep time. It pushes beyond time immemorial, gaining coherence over and against Indigenous temporalities. It asserts itself not as a temporal framework, but as the only temporal framework. Through glaciation, US settler-colonial countertemporality validates and normalizes itself, legitimating and rendering timeless settler claims to territory and political authority, and foreclosing upon not only other histories but other temporalities and other futurities.

It is known that in his Natural History the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder (23\u201279 AD) said that there was a mountain of iron in the Triano hills.Bengston, David and Michael J.

Modern development of the town is due to the mining industry. A cable-railway system was built at the end of the nineteenth century connecting the lower and upper part of the valley (1,200-meter elevation) and was used to transport the extracted iron. This, along with other infrastructural innovations, led to the settlement of the mining community in the upper part of the valley. As iron reserves were depleted and mining ceased, the community declined but did not disappear. The village is still inhabited today. As is often the case in open-cast mines in places where there is considerable precipitation, former mines are filled by surface water; in Trapagaran three lakes or ponds have been created. The scarring from the past mining activity is still visible today.\u00a0www.en.bilbaogreeters.com",

Mud was dumped in there from the treatment plant, which was the last part of the mining industry in the region to close down. This once-thriving little village, which had twenty-four bars, a forty-six-piece village band, hostels and schools, a cinema and theater, and even a police station, is now mainly residential with a few bars and restaurants. It has become a popular recreational destination, with visitors mainly from Greater Bilbao and beyond. The traditional dish of the miners, a bean stew, is famous in the region and many village restaurants serve it. Today, the area surrounding the water-filled mines is a recreational park (Pe\u00f1as Negras) with picnic and barbeque facilities. It is popular for fishing (swimming is not permitted), walking, biking, and horse-riding. Although the original mining infrastructure is no longer extant, there is a mining museum. The village itself has some interesting features: for example, while its architecture is of a style unique in the Basque country, the same construction is seen in a number of mining communities around Asturias and Cantabria. Perhaps also worthy of note is the fact that, with many of the miners coming from outside the Basque country, some of the local toponyms were \u201ccastilianized\u201d (for example, Larra\u00f1eta to La Reineta). In socioeconomic terms, the importance of Trapagaran extends well beyond the village itself, as the mining industry enhanced Bilbao\u2019s economic development a great deal. Although small-scale ironworks already existed in the area, 1902 saw an English\u2012Basque partnership that culminated in the creation of the Biscay\u2019s emblematic Altos Hornos (a huge ironworks complex). With its mineral resources and proximity to the seaport, and the area\u2019s metallurgical tradition, Bilbao was a prime location. After the Spanish Civil War, during Spain\u2019s rural exodus, the Basque industry attracted people from all over the country. Altos Hornos turned out to be crucial for Bilbao\u2019s industrialization.",

The landscape has changed considerably (certainly since industrial exploitation in the nineteenth century): with human settlement, mining infrastructure, the disappearance of a mountain, and the appearance of three new lakes. The vegetation has also now largely recovered from the scars inflicted by open-cast mining activity. The cable railway has become a tourist attraction and the area has a heritage center relating to the history of Bilbao\u2019s mining past. One of the sociopolitical implications of this renaissance is the bringing together of the left and right banks of the Nervi\u00f3n River (margen izquierda\u00a0and\u00a0margen derecha). These neighborhoods were socially and culturally disconnected in the past: the left bank populated with migrants from all over Spain who had come to work at the ironworks and the right bank home to the more bourgeois local population. This place was more than an iron mine; it was also an economic mine for the social and economic development of Bilbao and for the industrial revolution in general. In this sense, it is hard to say where this anthropogenic landscape ends, because its influence stretches beyond the local environment.",

For example, the contemporary petrochemical industry in Louisiana today occupies the same footprint along the banks of the Mississippi River that was once filled by plantations where enslaved people suffered under a brutal regime of forced labor. In this essay, Scott Knowles, Professor of History at Drexel University whose work focuses on the history of disaster worldwide, and Ashley Rogers, Executive Director of the Whitney Plantation Museum in Louisiana, unfold and critically examine this Anthropocenic space characterized by a long history of extraction, and call attention to the many untold stories underneath these layers of violence.",

                "text": "On January 8, 1811, the largest uprising of enslaved people in the history of the United States began on the Mississippi River plantations along the so-called German Coast of southern Louisiana. Inspired by the revolution in Haiti, which overthrew the slave power in 1804, almost 500 slaves participated, before being met and defeated by federal forces and local militia two days later, near present-day Kenner, Louisiana. Over the course of the revolt, two white men were killed. After summary trials, ninety-five of the slaves faced execution and decapitation, their heads posted on pikes stretching along the path of the revolt. It was a disaster that overwhelmed the local population as surely as any hurricane or epidemic. But suppression of this history was crucial to slave owners, who were desperate to keep their captives illiterate, ill informed, and isolated. And so, the German Coast Uprising remained mostly a local story, fading into near legend. It has not been widely taught or studied, and barely exists in American history textbooks. In November 2019, the performance artist and activist Dread Scott led a reenactment march to commemorate the uprising, and to inspire awareness of the connection between that distant history and our own time. The reenactment coincided with the opening of the Anthropocene River Campus, a multiday exploration of the Anthropocene, history, and environmental justice based in New Orleans and organized by the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin in partnership with The New Orleans Center for the Gulf South at Tulane University.",

But in an anthropocenic frame of mind, we need to take a much longer historical view, and we now see socioeconomic systems that were previously analyzed separately in the same frame: intensive, extractive plantation capitalism; unfree and unhealthy labor; structured violence and inequality\u2014from the slave system of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the Jim Crow system of racialized labor after 1865, to the industrial system of petrochemical production in the current era. The flow from system to system forms a remarkable anthropocenic continuity. Not only were South Louisiana slaveowners successful in their suppression of the German Coast Uprising and its history, but they thrived in the decades that followed. After the United States\u2019 participation in the international slave trade came to an end in 1808, Louisiana became the heart of the domestic slave trade in the Deep South. Investors and speculators streamed south, buying land to plant with cotton and sugarcane and slaves to work it. Propped up by a tariff on foreign sugar, Louisiana sugar planters expanded their holdings of land that hugged the river between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. They grew phenomenally wealthy off slave labor, building ever more opulent and fantastical plantation homes to showcase their success. These homes sat facing the levee one after another, each one with attendant, orderly rows of slave cabins crammed with dozens of enslaved workers. Louisiana\u2019s sugar plantations had some of the highest populations of enslaved people anywhere in the country. The stately homes, set off by lush gardens and stands of oak and pecan trees, obscured and softened the industrial-scale labor and violence in the fields and sugar factories. Mark Twain famously wrote in 1883 that Louisiana\u2019s plantation homes on either side of the river sat \u201cso close together, for long distances, that the broad river lying between the two rows, becomes a sort of spacious street.\u201d Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi. Boston, MA: James R. Osgood and Company, 1883, p. 247. By the time that Edmond Bozonier Marmillion, a prominent Louisiana planter, began building his fanciful San Francisco Plantation in the 1850s, the great slave revolt of 1811 must have felt to the community like a long-distant memory\u2014sugar planters were wealthier than ever, their success resting on the brutal, violent control of enslaved workers.",

Tourists from around the world come to southern Louisiana to experience the culture, food, and history of this once wealthy slave society. As with many plantation museums, the slave owner\u2019s home is the prize of San Francisco Plantation. The big house, with its ornate facade painted in rich Caribbean blues and yellows, is prominently featured in regional promotional materials and advertisements. A visitor might be forgiven for being captivated by this spectacle of Antebellum architecture\u2014that was the very purpose of its construction, after all. But it\u2019s hard to see the complex truth with your gaze fixed, myopically, on the house. Widening the scope reveals the architectural context of this 1853 mansion. It is surrounded today on all sides by petrochemical tanks and machinery belonging to the Marathon Oil Company, which owns and operates the museum. Beside, behind, throughout the property there are ugly, unsettling reminders of the economic imperative for the home\u2019s existence: in the nineteenth century, agricultural slavery; in the twentieth, petroleum. San Francisco Plantation, which was at one time known as Saint-Frusquin, is rare in how well documented it is as a site of violence. After Edmond Bozonier Marmillion died in 1856, his son Valsin Bozonier Marmillion took over the plantation. Multiple sources confirm the conditions enslaved people endured under Valsin\u2019s ownership. \u201cThe cruelest master in St. John the Baptist Parish during the time of slavery was Mr. Valsin Mermillion,\u201d recalled Mrs. Webb, a woman who had been formerly enslaved by Marmillion. \u201cOne of his cruelties was if a slave was disobedient, to put him standing in a box with nails in it, and make him stand in a way that he could not move and could not swat the flies and ants that crawled on him.\u201d Mrs. Webb, interview by Michinard, 8/17/40, Northwestern State University of Louisiana, Watson Memorial Library, Cammie G. Henry Research Center (Folder 19 of FWP). Translated from the Creole French by Whitney Plantation. Marmillion seemed to relish the ownership of his human chattel, so much so that he burned his own initials into their flesh.

Marmillion\u2019s practice of branding his enslaved workers became widely-known during the war. One man who was enslaved at San Francisco Plantation, Wilson Chinn, sat for photographs along with several other Louisiana freedpeople.

Historical scale is crucial to discussions of the Anthropocene, and so too is an understanding of the ways that disasters like a slave revolt, or Hurricane Katrina, or the Deepwater Horizon oil spill gather and hoard attention to the exclusion of slower and steadier processes of wealth making, and of violence. Strong economic and political forces are at work in the portrayal of a slave revolt or an oil spill as an aberrant event, unconnected from the normal flow of time, somehow separate and operating according to the logics of chance, or acts of God, or the madness of men. The idea of a \u201cslow disaster\u201d is a way to expose and explore these political investments in \u201cevent thinking,\u201d and an invitation to think about disasters not as atomized events but as long-term processes linked across time\u2014a crucial analytical act for the Anthropocene. Sometimes the linkages are documentable through the pages and photographs of a violent plantation era, sometimes they are buried more deeply in the land, the archaeological record, and at others aloft in the atmosphere. The plantations needed river access to move their sugar cane to market\u2014a global market that was intensifying over the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries through industrial-scale plantation agriculture and the brutal \u201cmanagement\u201d of slave-labor forces. The plantations marked out long, skinny plots of land, with majestic houses usually fronting the river, today hidden behind the Mississippi River levee system. Docks and refining works stood along the river, slave houses stretched back into the cane fields, and swampy woods made up the rear. After the Civil War\u2014the moment of an expected liberation for the freed population of the German Coast\u2014the economy carried on largely unchanged, with sons and daughters of enslaved people, and grandsons and granddaughters, working the land. They were tied to this land by Jim Crow laws that prevented free movement and locked African Americans in debt, unrepresented and in constant fear of racial terrorism. In the early twentieth century, the land use began to change. Oil was discovered at Beaumont, Texas, in 1901, which was quickly followed by discoveries in Louisiana in 1906. Standard Oil bought a 300-acre cotton plantation outside Baton Rouge in 1909, establishing a precedent for dozens of companies. Chemical manufacturing to serve markets for fertilizers, pesticides, plastics, and the manifold additives for petroleum manufacture settled in to stay. The long, skinny plantation holdings were now assembled for industrial uses\u2014perfectly situated for the purposes of petrochemical manufacturing with their river access points, once again tying the land and the factories to a toxic global market. As international companies bought up Louisiana\u2019s sugar and cotton lands, refineries, tank farms, and pipelines began to share space with plantations, many of which did not cease operations until the late twentieth century. The intensification of petrochemical manufacturing along this stretch of river delta is heralded as one of the defining features of American economic development through and following the Second World War. Environmental impacts\u2014manifest in the air, the water, the senses of the residents and workers\u2014were ignored in the absence of any regulations or restraint. Sugarcane still grows along the edges of the industrial plants, and cattle graze along the fence lines.",

New York: Springer-Verlag, 2011. it fueled cars that made the urban sprawl possible; fueled the production of inexpensive fertilizers and farm equipment, which increased productivity and lowered the cost of food; and made the dramatic rise of plastics possible. The widespread availability of antibiotics and basic medical care, along with sufficient food, enabled the global human population to accelerate its exponential growth. At the same time, the overuse of renewable and nonrenewable resources was occurring at a localized scale. Advances in measurement technologies were enabling documentation of increasing trends of pollution in air, water, and soil. As most of the West basked in this new prosperity, critical analyses of the consequences of these trends began emerging. Rachel Carson published\u00a0Silent Spring in 1962;Rachel Carson,\u00a0Silent Spring. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1962. Garrett Hardin published his essay \u201cThe Tragedy of the Commons\u201d in 1968,Garrett Harding, \u201cThe tragedy of the commons,\u201d Science, vol. 162, no. 3859 (1968): pp. 1243\u20128. a year that also saw publication of\u00a0The Population Bomb by Paul Ehrlich.Paul R. Ehrlich, The Population Bomb. New York: Ballantine Books, 1968. In the spring of 1968 Dr. Aurelio Peccei, an industrial manager at Fiat and Olivetti and economist, gathered a group of thirty scientists, educators, economists, humanists, industrialists, and national and international civil servants for a meeting at the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome. The first meeting focused on \u201cThe Project on the Predicament of Mankind.\u201dWilliam Watts, \u201cForeword,\u201d in: Donella H. Meadows et al.,\u00a0The Limits to Growth, New York: Universe Books, 1972, p. 10, online. They decided that at the core of the \u201cpredicament of mankind\u201d was the inability of humans to understand the sources, significance, and interrelationships of the components of society, which together were creating economic inequality, economic disruptions, insecure employment, and so on. Peccei met Jay Wright Forrester from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who was developing the new science of \u201cindustrial dynamics\u201d or \u201csystem dynamics.\u201d In 1970, Forrester convinced the Club of Rome to use system dynamics to explore the individual components and their interactions that comprised the global economic and environmental system. Forrester enlisted his former student and new faculty member at the time, Dennis Meadows, to undertake this task. The results of this effort were Forrester\u2019s analysis World Dynamics, published in 1971, and\u00a0The Limits to Growth, published in 1972 by Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows, J\u00f8rgen Randers, and William W. Behrens III.Jay Wright Forrester, World Dynamics. Cambridge, MA: Wright-Allen Press, 1971; Donella H. Meadows, et al., The Limits to Growth. New York: Signet, 1972. Forrester sold about 100,000 copies and Meadows and his co-authors sold more than one million copies of the book, which was translated into over thirty languages. These analyses clearly resonated with growing concerns over coming world trends. The World3 model The World3 model was the system dynamics model developed by Meadows and co-workers to explore interrelationships between global systems. This model was one of the first large-scale system dynamics models made possible through a modern computing infrastructure. It represented the transition of computing methods used by the military to civil society and the critique of social trends. The model was the first to link the world economy with the global environment in an integrated fashion. The World3 model is based on a \u201cstock and flow\u201d framework. The model tracks trends in five global subsystems: population, food production, industrial production, pollution, and consumption of nonrenewable natural resources. As the name implies, the geographic boundary of the model was the world and the temporal boundary was 1900 to 2011. As described by Turner (2007), the model involves four key elements. The first was feedback loops, both positive and negative. This enabled the propagation (positive) or dampening of modifications or trends within and between systems. The second element was an accounting of resources such as agricultural land, the productivity of which could be diminished by the functioning of the economic system (i.e. overuse). This is the essence of the \u201cstock and flow\u201d architecture of the model. The third element was the delay of signals between subsystems. For example, the model (correctly) delayed the impact of increasing pollution on reducing human life expectancy and agricultural production. This element, together with feedbacks, allowed the model to capture \u201covershoot\u201d or the inability of the system to \u201ccorrect\u201d or stabilize itself before experiencing a downward trend (i.e. a decrease in food production and population). The fourth element was treating the world economic system as a set of complete subsystems. The importance of the interrelationships among these systems was a critical feature originally identified by the Club of Rome.  Due to the inherent complexity of each of the five subsystems, the World3 model necessarily simplified each system and hence the total global system. For example, industrial output and population were expressed as aggregate global values that neglected regional differences. Nonrenewable resources were defined as those resources that were essential for industrial production and with a regeneration time much longer than the 200-year time span of the model. Within each subsystem, a series of variables were used as inputs to the model. Data behind these variables were gleaned from world statistics. Outputs from the World3 model were eight variables including global population, crude birth rate, crude death rate, and services per capita. The results from the World3 model were explosive. The model reproduced exponential rates of increasing population, per capita food availability, and industrial output from the early 1900s to the 1970s. The model forecast a bleak future, the crash of the global economy and of the human population, brought about primarily by resource constraints and secondarily by increasing pollution. In particular, the decline was produced by exponentially increasing global consumption of finite resources where increasing industrial output was required to obtain more scarce resources. In turn, the diversion of ever-increasing industrial output towards exploiting finite resources caused decreased investment in human welfare. Thus, the model drew a causal link between decreasing human welfare and resource consumption, a connection that hitherto had not been made so clearly. The results from the model also connected the diversion of industrial output to resource exploitation and away from agriculture, with the effect of reducing the per capita food supply. In addition to producing a simulation of their \u201cbest estimate\u201d of global trends, the model allowed for the testing of various hypotheses. For example, the model was used to test hypotheses within each submodel, such as the effect of desired family size on population growth. The effects of submodel interactions were also explored, such as the impact of unlimited resources on the output of the other submodels. The World3 model as a whole was used to explore the changes that would be required to stabilize the world population through technological advances that affected agricultural production, the availability of birth control, resource use, and pollution. As such, the World3 model allowed for a better understanding of the factors that could be useful to influence and stabilize world trends.    The Limits to Growth\u00a0had a major impact. One reflection of that impact was the quick and fierce criticisms it received, to the extent of personal criticisms leveled at the modeling team. It provoked debate about the veracity of processes included in the model, which continues to be debated today. The critics were quick to point out that the analysis was yet another doomsday prognostication and could join others in the \u201cdustbin of history,\u201d such as Thomas Malthus\u2019 prediction that population decline would be brought about by population growth and insufficient food. Others criticized the analysis for its inaccuracy\u2014that projections contained in the analysis were not coming to fruition. But perhaps the key point is that the model fostered investigation and probing of the model and its components in a way that was not possible before it was published. It should also be borne in mind that this was the start of the science of systems analysis and simultaneous quantitative consideration of the economy and environment. Today, this represents a robust and fertile field of inquiry. In 2007 and 2012, Graham Turner revisited the World3 model by updating model parameterization and evaluating model output against current data trends. The results of his analysis were disquieting. His analysis showed, in fact, that current data were consistent with trends predicted in the World3 model. Turner drew the connection between the economic downturn starting in 2008 and the diversion of industrial output towards extracting resources with a decreasing \u201cenergy returned on energy invested\u201d or EROI. Thus, using the model, he pointed the finger directly at unfettered resource consumption as the underlying cause of the global economic downturn and that the downturn was prescient of global collapse. As it had originally,\u00a0The Limits to Growth\u2019s more recent incarnations continue to provoke debate. It is a key argument used by proponents of sustainability. It has sparked inquiry into the underlying processes and the behaviors of the global economy as a whole. It enabled the \u201ctame\u201d consideration of the very wicked problem of the sustained future of the global population.",

                "text": "In their pursuit of economic progress, modern societies have repurposed nature on account of its \u201cuse\u201d value. Accordingly, new universalizing ideas of pedagogy, finance, governance, and capital, as well as culture, have created systems and institutions where the multiplicity of nature(s) (as local ecosystems, livelihoods, identities, ways of life, etc.) is unacknowledged. This has led to the ecological crisis, as marked by the Anthropocene, a consequence of the loss of the innumerable relationships in which people and nature have coexisted. For example, within a short period of recent human history, river natures in particular have been drastically altered by technology and capital. Their embedded forms are visible as steel towers, power lines, embankments, dams, and barrages, which have reshaped their flows and imposed a logic of \u201cfunction.\u201d People who for centuries have interacted with and lived alongside riverbanks, riversides, or marshlands have paid the price in terms of their lives and lifestyles. Long-standing riverine communities can testify that nature is not a \u201cthing\u201d somewhere \u201cout there.\u201d They have shaped and been shaped by the landscapes they have inhabited. For example, referring to eastern India, the historian Arupjyoti Saika describes nineteenth-century colonial settlers discovering that \u201cthe floodplains of the (river) Brahmaputra constituted a complex agrarian landscape that demanded continuous interaction between the floodplains, hills and foothills.\u201dArupjyoti Saika, The Unquiet River, a biography of the Brahmaputra. New Delhi: OUP, 2019, p. 76. Ideas of nature were produced through these interactions over time, and in turn, these ideas became integrated into culture, rituals, and ways of life. This was evident as I flew into New Orleans. I was awestruck by the massive networks of water channels visible as threads in the delta below, where the meandering and channelized Mississippi River met the Gulf of Mexico. I could not but help reflect upon how its once free flows, interconnected with planetary systems of waters, had been shaped in deep time. More than ten thousand miles away, similar to the Mississippi Delta and the Gulf, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet with the Bay of Bengal, to form another huge braided estuary of shifting lands, silt, and water, which define the border between two nation states\u2014India and Bangladesh. Here too, the constant effort over the past couple of hundred years, has been to embank, control and dam the rivers. In fact, the relationship between these river systems has been more than notional. In 1955, Harvill E. Weller of the Mississippi River Commission was invited by the Indian Government to seek his advice on how to tame the wild Brahmaputra\u2014an example of an attempt to control river natures through global knowledge, technology, and capital, without accounting for their very heterogeneous landscape and demographic specifics. \u00a0It seems that they were all out to prove Mark Twain wrong when he wrote \u201cThe Mississippi will always have its own way: no engineering skills can persuade it to do otherwise.\u201d Mark Twain in Eruption: Hitherto Unpublished Pages About Men and Events, edited by Bernard DeVoto. New York, NY: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1940. From the ground, however, the view becomes entirely different. A tectonic shift in perspective occurs. Everything becomes diminutive, reduced to a human scale, not only in spatial but also in temporal terms, when seen from the eyes of communities that have lived there, yet who have been rendered invisible. In many cases, a fusion of \u201cself\u201d with \u201cnature\u201d formed identities and value systems that recognized with humility and respect a supremacy of nature\u2014notions that many indigenous communities embedded within their knowledge systems. Indigenous cultures typically demonstrate ways in which complex everyday relationships with nature are regarded as reciprocal or integrated, with the natural world deemed to be held in trusteeship for future generations. Reflecting upon such tenancies towards nature, author Amitav Ghosh cites the tale of Bon Bibi, the forest god of the Bengal Sundarbans: Amitav Ghosh, Wild Fictions (2008), p. 13: https://www.amitavghosh.com/docs/Wild%20Fictions.pdf [T]he Bon Bibi legend uses the power of fiction to create and define a relationship between human beings and the natural world. Nowhere does a term equivalent to \u201cNature\u201d figure in the legend of Bon Bibi, yet nowhere is its consciousness absent; although ecological concerns are never named, the story is profoundly informed by that awareness which the literary critic Larry Buell has termed \u201cthe environmental unconscious\u201d\u2014a phrase that is all the more useful, in my view, because it does not invoke the cultural and linguistic freightage of the word \u201cNature.\u201d",

And: how able were we to really comprehend a very different way of life and its perspectives? Both questions were about an ability to move out of fixed viewpoints of what we \u201cknow\u201d and to be able to listen to and understand what may be totally alien to us. Paradoxically, as a result of many modern approaches to education and learning, it seems that our ability to acknowledge and comprehend a standpoint entirely different from the mainstream has been curtailed. Hence the challenges these questions posed are not easy to overcome. Furthermore, in our desire to control and shape nature to our own ends, we have ceased to listen to its voices, its murmurs, and it silences.\u00a0 In fact, in the era of the Anthropocene, nature\u2019s complexity has been rendered inaudible.

To do that, understanding diverse community experiences with nature, such as at Pointe-Au-Chien, could be key to forging a path of co-existence in the Anthropocene. But how does one do this in our current moment, when these ways of life are under threat and disappearing, and we may not even know how to comprehend their complexities anymore? Where does one begin? Listening with respect and an open mind is a good place to start\u2014even with the difficulties it brings. It can entail an onto-epistemological shift. For example, when engaging as an artist and environmentalist with traditional fisherfolk in Southern India, I wondered if we spoke a culturally common language. \u201cWas the sea I saw, the sea they saw?\u201d I wondered. While for me the sea was a limitless body of water sometimes beautiful, sometimes stormy or calm, in a distant and abstract way, for them it was a part of their lives, constituting an everyday coexistence of livelihood, experiences, and rituals. Hence listening is not simply about hearing but entails crossing boundaries and positions. It implies being in a mode of receiving and being respectful. It is also about reconstituting political and power positions, where the \u201cother\u201d is considered an equal. It is a de-colonizing of one\u2019s own gaze. It can allow one to visit a place and gain new understandings. As an ancient Zen Buddhist saying suggests, we should, \u201cempty the cup (of knowledge),\u201d and start listening with non-knowing and curiosity. With an empty cup, one can receive, and thereby understand in deeper ways.",

Our boats are cleaned, tents are set, we are getting a fire going, and I am happy to be here. At the same time, the night before I was still in some kind of shock. The plan to learn more about my subject, as a historian of chemical industry, by stopping by one of its national landmarks, the Exxon Refinery at Baton Rouge, where chemical history was written by German and US chemists in the 1930s and where the first fluid bed reactor for catalytic cracking of oil was developed in 1942 almost led to mine and Joe Underhill\u2019s arrest. Together with Isabelle Carbonell and Margarida Mendes, we had taken a Lyft to the refinery. And just as Joe and I were talking about the huge machinery on the other side of the electric fence, about the history of the place and the planetary impact of molecular technology, a police car came by. \u201cShow me your IDs! Are you armed? I want to see your hands! What\u2019s in that bag? Don\u2019t touch that bag!\u201d Two minutes later, we found ourselves in a second round of questioning on the back seat of the police car. \u201cSeat\u201d is very generous term for this micro prison of hard plastic surfaces, bars, and security glass. While sitting there, I found myself wondering what exactly we had done wrong and where we might have entered private property; at no point between the place where the Lyft dropped us and the point where we were accosted did we come across a sign indicating we were on private property. And we were still outside the refinery fence. But the fence doesn\u2019t play a role here. It was only during the third round of questioning by a more civilian-like officer, who turned out to be the Sheriff, could I begin imagine I was not about to be put on the next plane back to Germany. Finally, we were released and after some surprisingly collegial chatting with the refinery\u2019s security staff regarding how we might arrange an \u201cofficial\u201d visit to the place, the next Lyft took us out of there. What was so frightening about our walk along the fence? How could this simple act provoke the petrostate to bare its teeth? We will never know. On Plaquemine Island, after one day of paddling as part of the Anthropocene River Journey, this experience already seems far away. Instead of the more frightening aspects of the petrostate, we get an impression of the industrial sublime. As the sun is setting, on the other side of the river the Dow chemical plant is rising, illuminated by hundreds of electric lights and some Mordor-like flares of gas. This rising of this artificial sun brings to mind the corporate hymn of Russian Gazprom, with its last lines: \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439 \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0441, \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0441 / \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u0437, / \u0417\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u044b\u043b / \u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435. \u201cLet\u2019s drink to you, lets drink to us, the drink to all the Russian gas\u201d and then: \u201cLet&#8217;s drink to all those who brought to Earth this artificial sun.\u201d",

Between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, for a length of around one hundred miles along the Mississippi River before it reaches the Delta and the Gulf of Mexico, stretches one of the largest chemical and refinery landscapes in the world. Once, it was a center of chemical industrial innovation, not least through close cooperation since the late 1920s between U.S. chemistry and I.G. Farben via scientific bodies such as the Catalysis Research Associates (CRA). The cooperation continued after the Nazis came to power, and even into the first years of the Second World War. Having this history of innovation and political contamination of industry in mind, I am curious to spend the next week paddling through the actual state of industry in the petrochemical corridor. Here, the Mississippi is like a string of industrial pearls, with well known and lesser known companies hanging from the banks of the river: Exxon, LaRoche, BASF, Shell, Rubicon, Praxair, Air Liquide, Formosa, Shintech, Mexichem, Poly One, Mosaic, CF Industries, DowDuPont, Chevron, Sid Richardson, Epsilon, Marathon, Nalco, Colonial Sugar, Witco, DSM Polymer, and countless others. At locations such as Norco, Plaquemine, Geismar, companies are clustered together, and yellow pages are needed for orientation. In between, for electricity supply, there are some coal-fired power plants, along with one nuclear plant. Geographically, several far-reaching flow systems lie one above the other here. They flow into this area as if into a reaction chamber and emerge from it in a processed way.",

But the river is also one of the most important inland waterways in the world, and, matching the exact height of the Exxon refinery in Baton Rouge, it is kept clear by the US Army Corps of Engineers for ocean-going freighters with a draught of up to 13 meters. This watercourse provides direct access to all the world\u2019s oceans and, via the world\u2019s largest network of inland waterways, to numerous agricultural and industrial areas in North America. In the next days, when paddling from Plaquemine Island further south to New Orleans, we will see gigantic convoys of up to 70 barges coupled together to ship artificial fertilizers and pesticides from the lower Mississippi into the corn and soy monocultures of the Midwest reaches and to return with the products of industrial agriculture. In fact, soil erosion in the Midwest causes a significant amount of nitrate freight to return downstream and to pass the factories it may have been made in, and to continue further into the Gulf of Mexico where it leads algae to bloom and creates oxygen-free dead zones in the aquatic environment.",

                "text": "Next to and below the flow of water, which serves as both as a raw material and means of transport, are the no less significant flows of oil and gas. Louisiana itself has huge deposits, both in the immediate vicinity of the delta and offshore. In addition, a confusingly dense network of pipelines crosses and follows the entire length of the Mississippi. Plantation, Dixie, Coastal, Colonial are only the best-known long-distance pipelines linking the region with onshore and offshore oilfields in the Gulf, Texas, Oklahoma, the Dakotas in the US, and Alberta in Canada. In many cases, the location of pipelines is unclear even to landowners, and special authorities must be contacted for information prior to excavation work. All kinds of chemicals are produced or were produced in this chemical corridor: basic materials such as fertilizers, sulfuric acid and methanol, aluminum and chlorine, refinery products such as fuels, solvents and lubricants, fuel additives such as the formerly legendary tetraethyl lead, plus synthetic fibers and plastics such as nylon, neoprene and synthetic rubber, insecticides, herbicides, refrigerants, and much more. In the reactors of the chemical factories, the various resources the globe has to offer come together: Hydrocarbons and sulfur from oil deposits, nitrogen from the atmosphere, hydrogen and ethane from natural gas, coal, ores, and metals. What is synthesized from the lithosphere and the atmosphere flows back into every corner of the Earth, transformed and transforming the technosphere and biosphere as fuel, fertilizer, pesticide, or plastic. One factor appears to be absent in such material flows: humans. We will see very few humans along the river. We can hear some ship captains over the radio with whom we need to navigate our canoes through the traffic, we will see some workers at docks, and we will see a few people from some villages behind the levees with their fishing ropes. Humans who are not working seem to avoid the river. No motor boats, no sportsmen, no playing children, no barge spotters. Compared to European rivers, this seems strange. One evening we are hosted by some of the Mississippi\u2019s so-called river angels, a group who provide assistance to paddlers. They let us camp between a levee and the river on their ground, show us the alligators in the nearby swamp, drive us around in their golf carts, and explain their (German-influenced) Christmas celebration habits involving hundreds of bonfires on the levee. This will be one of rare occasions to talk with people beyond our traveling group on the journey, and it is great fun. But even here, we learn about the ambivalent relationship of the locals to the river. They almost never come on this side of the levee, some old ladies from a card game group (pokeno) tell us, when they arrive in trucks and golf carts for the barbecue. But we don\u2019t get a chance to talk to African American people on this tour. Only in New Orleans, during the Anthropocene River Campus, does this happen. In fact, their history is linked to global commodity flows in an intimate and very problematic way. For generations, the ancestors of most of today\u2019s inhabitants of the region were themselves treated as a global commodity and human fuel\u2014enslaved on sugar cane plantations. French, but also German and British-American colonists, engaged in perverted and brutal ownership of enslaved people. At that time, Louisiana was the centerpiece of. as geographer Kathryn Yussof explains,Kathtryn Yussof, One billion black Anthropocenes or none. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press (2018), p. 15. a globally energetic and imperialistic chain of production. In Louisiana, this type of intercontinental slavery began in the seventeenth century, but in the middle of the nineteenth century a truly planetary chain was in action: with a labor force deported from what now belongs to Senegal and Gambia in Western Africa to grow sugar cane, a plant originally from Southeast Asia, to supply European labor, which in turn was exploited to produce coal as a further imperial means of power. Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe, sugar cane, labor, and coal connected to a self-accelerating system. Slavery was officially abolished in the US on December 18, 1865, and sugar cane is today harvested and loaded with machines, as we witness during our excursions as part of the Anthropocene River Campus. However, the energy regime and economic system of slavery still forms the basis of the current, entrepreneurial geography. Sugar factories were the first chemical factories in the region, long before the oil boom. The petrochemical complexes are located on the cadaster of former plantations, old cemeteries can be found behind the barbed wire of refineries. Until the 1990s, the descendants of enslaved people lived in shacks built for sharecroppers, while oak-lined mansions are rented out for white weddings. But feelings are more than just feelings here. Companies in the petrochemical corridor concretely profit from weak social structures and very directly from a civil society that has been trained to lawlessness by slavery and racism and weakened by lack of prospects and unemployment. Worker\u2019s protection and environmental regulations are systematically disregarded, taxes are cunningly avoided, regional planning plans are fudged, the region is a notoriously polluted \u201ccancer alley.\u201d Only in individual cases can intrepid representatives and civil rights activists negotiate better conditions, as we learn during site visits as part of the Campus. We learn, for example, that the historical record of the Whitney Plantation and its conversion into Louisiana\u2019s only slavery memorial under the guidance of museum research director Ibrahima Seck was almost paradoxically due to the plans of the Taiwanese Formosa group to set up a rayon factory on the site,Ibrahima Seck, Bouki fait Gombo: a history of the slave community of habitation haydel (Whitney Plantation), Louisiana, 1750 \u2013 1860. New Orleans, LA: University of New Orleans Press (2014). and the preparation process required a full historical survey before the site could be converted into a chemical plant. The plant plan failed, but the memorial came into being. What was started with the survey led to the now existing institution, when in 1999, John Cummings, a retired, white lawyer from New Orleans, bought the site and, together with Seck, a scholar from Senegal, established the museum and memorial that opened its doors in 2015.",

This despite the fact that in a technical sense, fossil energy was one of the strongest factors to change the role of human labor in the general economic system and through that also the role of slave and child labor. US society in particular profited from fossil energy at a very early stage. As early as 1920, the equivalent workforce of 16 humans were available to every average US American in the form of coal energy. By 1937, that number had risen to 21, including the fossil energy derived from crude oil, as the German chemist, Nobel Prize Laureate and peace activist Hermann Staudinger (a rare combination) found and as many others have investigated further since Staudinger\u2019s first articles were published.Hermann Staudinger, Der Aufstand der technischen Sklaven. Essen: Dr. Hans von Chamier Verla (1948), p.60-66.  This ratio has since shifted dramatically with the manufacture of every new pickup truck, air conditioning system, and styrofoam plate. In the petrochemical corridor, however, fossil energy does not mean empowerment, but inland colonial paternalism. Fossil profit-seeking ruins entire ecosystems, constrains individuals and communities, corrupts universities, and weakens the state. Paddling for a week through a landscape shaped by a continent bisecting river garlanded, in its lower stretch, by the simultaneously planetary and molecular industries of petrochemistry was a strange experience. We are used to a slow flaneur-esque mode perception while paddling or walking in natural environments, enjoying the sublime of mountains or forests. On the River Journey, this way of slow experience adapted to become a heavily industrialized form of ambience. The landmarks mentioned when planning the day are not big trees and caves, but refineries and ammonia plants. And yet it is strange that in this very industrialized area a lot of wildlife is still visible. Many flora and fauna, but also bald eagles, pelicans, alligators, just to name some of most impressive animals for a European guest in this part of the world. Getting on a canoe, camping on islands and sandbars means to become part of this landscape, at least for a few days and nights. It also means letting this wounded landscape come close to our own bodies. In fact, via our ingestion of the products of this region, this landscape, are close wherever we are. Neoprene, glue sticks, plastics, fertilizers, and fuels are part of our lives\u2014and our bodies\u2014and it would be strange to deny the role that this chemical industry plays for our wellbeing, with all the ambivalences that relation entails. Here on the river and within reach of the factories though, this relation gets even more \u201creal,\u201d because the elements of the landscape themselves affect us. So it became obvious that the experience on the river would involve swimming in it at least, even if\u2014or just because\u2014this may not be the purest water. It would be dishonest to encounter all of this without getting hurt, at least in a symbolic way. So, one day, alone in the early morning, with a nuclear power plant straight ahead, a refinery to the left, a strip of forest to the right, and the waters of an industrial continent around my naked human body, I took a swim. With all types of industry, but in particular with chemical industry, which is so deeply connected to strategic resources and products, there is no neutral ground. Fuels and fertilizers are a means of everyday life, but also of political power. Even a look at an industrial site can provoke a somehow political reaction, as our experience at the Exxon refinery at Baton Rouge revealed. The historical and ecological contamination of the region belong together. Together, at the crossroads of water and oil, they form the prerequisite for the petrochemical industry to develop in a destructive rather than an innovative way, for billions of dollars to continue to be invested in the acceleration of a harmful infrastructure, doomed to fulfil its own destruction.",

In this era of increasingly rapid climate change, these once rare events, so-called 1000 Year Floods, have become increasingly common, rendering absurd both this nomenclature and the climate denialism which has brought us to this place in history.

It also references the slowness that is required to digest and process the complex information and ideas communicated through these media, and the length of time that might be needed for a novel understanding to fully emerge from the ideas and questions that they pose. Additionally, slowness might speak to an ability of Slow Media to express or communicate expanded timescales: epochs and durations that exceed the human time frame, and that might encompass distal pasts and distant speculative or possible futures. What constitutes a medium in the framework of Slow Media is a key constituent of this mapping project. There exist a multitude of organic and inorganic matter, objects, symbols, processes, movements, rhythms, and spaces that can be read as media\u2014that is, as being inscribed (or inscribable) with information, ideas, or stories. These \u201cother\u201d media forms are those that exceed purely textual or figural media, that exceed mathematically or scientifically encoded forms, and that are not necessarily predicated on linear and visual narratives. Examples discussed included rocks\u2014both Neolithic and specifically Anthropocenic (e.g. Trinitite, a rock formed as a result of plutonium testing at the Trinity test site in New Mexico); soil and its many nutrient flows and dynamic feedback loops; architectural spaces (museological or otherwise); food systems; birdsong; sunlight; dance and performance; and spaces that provoke an entrainment of embodied rhythms. Here, the examples of \u201cother\u201d media generated in this exercise are in no way intended to represent an \u201cabsolute diagram\u201d of possible media forms, but to speak to the heterogeneity and complexity of the map itself. In the context of mapping a Slow Media of the Anthropocene, the language of the medium must also be expanded to include (perhaps even foreground) movements and processes as legitimate sites of media production, reception, and communication. In cartographic terms, this translates to a heightened attention to the arrows or lines (indicating movements or processual linkages) between objects on a map, rather than the objects themselves. Here, the objects might exist not as endpoints within the map, or as canonical descriptors of absolute media modes, but as spaces of contextual pause, which always lead us on to a multitude of other possible movements, transformations, and ideas. Importantly, different media forms also embed or express different ways of knowing or different ontological frameworks, as well as different languages or symbolic or semiotic indices. Further, they call for different modes of engagement and attention, in order that we might perceive or read them as \u201cmedia,\u201d and therein grasp something of what is being communicated. The expansion of the term media is important in trying to imagine a Slow Media that might have some agency in framing or reframing our collective approach to thinking the Anthropocene. Here, the expansion of media\u2014to include the extratextual, the nonhierarchical, the nonlinear\u2014might be that which opens us up to alternative ontologies, so that we might be able to thicken or recalibrate our approach to thinking through the suite of issues and questions posed by the Anthropocene. Donna Haraway has suggested: \u201cit matters to destabilize worlds of thinking with other worlds of thinking.\u201dDonna Haraway, \u201cAnthropocene, Capitalocene, Cthulucene: Staying with the trouble,\u201d talk at University of California, Santa Cruz, May 9, 2014, online (accessed 12/07/2015). Here is an imperative to reconstitute the language or media that frames our \u201cworlds of thinking,\u201d through an attempt to read the different forms of information given in an expanded realm of Slow Media. Haraway emphasizes the importance of \u201cdestabilization,\u201d which is required first in order to open onto other frameworks of reading, listening, thinking, and knowing. Within a new conception of Slow Media, and its request for an expansion of \u201clegible\u201d media forms, there is an implicit and necessary disruption and dissociation from normative modes of thinking and knowing. The disruptive is then a key agent in the idea of Slow Media\u2014the shift required from habitual conceptions of media and from habitual modes of attending to them, the shift required to disengage from accelerative temporalities and modes of cognition.",

                "text": "Long before it will become someone\u2019s property, this place is a salty inland basin that fills and empties over long intervals, drawing down silt and nutrients from hot equatorial forests that feed teeming microscopic life forms, the precursors to oil. Much later come intervals of extreme cold, years of glaciers advancing and retreating, and then finally a melt. Some people on this continent know of the ice from their ancestors\u2019 stories. Now, around 2500 BCE, the Mississippi River is really starting to get going, moving its fresh water and silt down a slow grade, carving and filling land, avulsing into new channels, and dumping successions of sediment loads in lobes of soil that extend into a sea. Small bands of people move through and live on these spits and marshes, gathering shellfish, hunting; some are the predecessors of people who still live here, while others leave only remnants of their occupation in shell middens and mounds. A rich time; buffalo graze all the way down to the gulf. A thousand years from now, in 1540, an adventurer from afar named Hernando de Soto will drift down the Mississippi and leave his remains as well. Another hundred years pass, and the French explorer Robert de La Salle takes his turn to float down the channel. He claims the land, valley, waterways, trees, bayous\u2014all of it and more\u2014for France. The terms \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d compose the title of a seminar convened during the November 2019 Anthropocene River Campus to investigate how cultures of property support, infiltrate, and inform processes of the Anthropocene. This topic emerged from a process of collective analysis and writing at the Anthropocene River Midway Meeting in St. Louis in the spring of 2019. As seminar conveners, we hoped not only to address land as property but to draw out gray zones of epistemic significance, such as how the practice of property sees all life as its potential object. Indeed, the pervasiveness of property and its sedimentation through both space and time made it difficult to settle on a plan. For one, how were we to pursue a subject that is more social practice than thing? Neither \u201cproperty\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d can be observed as material or infrastructural projects, such as a dam, hospital, prison, or school can. Yet property provides the economic and political underpinnings for such projects\u2014whose benefits are subsequently unevenly distributed. To think about property is to think about its political predisposition and social effects as part of a broad and subjective variegation of emotional charge. Who is able to have access to or \u201cmake\u201d property, and how, and for what purposes? Claims, whether to territory, speech, or narrative, are likewise enunciated by social subjects and infused by feelings. We needed to encounter the narratives and feelings that generated these claims. But it seemed paralyzing to imagine how, and with whom, especially for those of us who live far from the context of New Orleans. And for some, our identities also mattered, as white people from settler or immigrant ancestries who enjoy advantageous property relations through no efforts of our own. We recognized that contingencies and differences between people are symptomatic of and charged with the full weight of the contradictions and inequities issued in society. Our initial conversations hovered on the sticky questions of how the historical making of property has disproportionately negated the existence of some more than others\u2014the same people who suffer environmental vulnerability, and political and economic exclusion. It seemed important, then, to situate our seminar\u2019s practice as one of observing and listening to these experiences, even though imagining such conversations with roughly thirty people beyond our initial convening group (Morgan Adamson, Bruce Braun, Ravi Agarwal, Shana M. griffin) seemed overwhelming. We did not want to use the form of a tour, because claims and property, rights and access, are precisely the facts that tourism conceals. An investigation into place should instead entail learning about the means through which people are able to animate that place to make it home, and the obstacles that prevent that. We decided to explore New Orleans as a territory alongside our hosts, experts, and conveners. We leaned heavily on the knowledge, generosity, and affinities of Shana M. griffin, Grace Treffinger, Geneva Leboeuf, Laura Kelley, and Nathan Jessee. We reflexively reframed our questions about property and claims through listening to their experiences, divulged formally and informally, walking, eating, and being together.",

Territory thus offers a way to attend to differentials of experience across scales of affect, allowing property and claims to be seen self-reflexively but also as part of complex geopolitical assemblages laden with difference and injustice. How might a collective listening practice take in and resonate feelings of injustice in order to raise their volume and urgency? What would it take to facilitate the reparation of such losses? Injustice demands to be heard and to be witnessed, and to be felt, in order to prepare for repair. Indigenous feminist scholar Dian Million cites the importance of the personal, felt narrative in building political power among Indigenous victims of state violence.

How can allies address such failure? In listening, we are called to witness the insidious moves, from the local to the global, through which property is made and leveraged, and the ways it alienates and disenfranchises. To witness is a kind of labor that necessitates making more room in the self for the trauma of others, to open the imagination to more ethical practices of place.

The Geographies of Black displacement is a multimedia and public history research project that illuminates the systematic dislocation and denigration of New Orleans black populations, from the period of enslavement, through shifting housing policies, to forms of racialized violence and confinement. Shana\u2019s research has informed her work as a housing activist and community organizer. We get to experience this profound project as a guided walk through the oldest areas of New Orleans. We stop first at the bronze statue of Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, the colonialist who founded New Orleans in 1718. The monument, a gift from France, stands in a small park. We consider the trio of figures: Bienville, the tallest, faces the horizon, while beside him his companion, the Augustinian monk Father Athanase, looks down at a bible. At Bienville\u2019s feet sits an unnamed Indigenous man with a feathered pipe in his hands. One looks toward a future, the second to Divine Law, and the third is a cipher. On the nearby river levee, we take in a new marker installed for the city\u2019s 300-year anniversary. The information panel, titled \u201cTransatlantic Slave Trade to Louisiana,\u201d tells us that in the same year the city was founded, two ships left Africa for New Orleans with 451 people in bondage. They arrived on these shores in 1719. The plaque continues, \u201cTheir skills and cultural practices were foundational to the development of Louisiana.\u201d The marker cites their origins, humanizing them as cultures, nations: \u201cWolof, Bambara, Mandingo, Fulbe, Nard, Ganga, Kissy, Susu, Mina, Fon, Yoruba, Chamba, Hausa, Igbo, Ibibio, Kongo/Angola, Makwa.\u201d They were, the panel says, cargo, \u201cunloaded here on the banks of the Mississippi River.\u201d Shana mentions that the ships could be smelled two weeks before arrival because of the conditions on board.

In 1803, having failed to stop the revolution in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), France sold its continental territories to the United States. Settler agriculture expanded into these ancestral homes of the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), and other nations, who were forced to move elsewhere. Some found their way to the bayous of Louisiana. Meanwhile, three technological advances transformed agriculture: the steamboat, the cotton gin, and granulated sugar processing. Together, they intensified the demand for unfree labor. In 1804, Haiti became an independent nation, and nearly 10,000 Haitian refugees, including sugar planters, enslaved people, and free Blacks, migrated to New Orleans. Four years later, in 1808, the United States abolished the international slave trade. This gave rise to a domestic market known as the \u201csecond middle passage.\u201d Enslaved black people were transported up and down river by boat, or even forced to walk from Virginia or the Carolinas to New Orleans markets. In 1812, Louisiana became a state. Eventually, 400 plantations were established between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, giving rise to the highest concentration of millionaires in the United States. By 1820, the city was the biggest market for slaves in the country. Sales took place in private homes, on street corners, inside banks, insurance companies, schools, and hospitals. \u201cSlavery, sex, and sugar\u201d became New Orleans\u2019s primary tourist attractions. Shana conjures this past through her incantation of the everyday. Partying tourists cruise by us as we look for traces of slave quarters along the side of an old building. These were tiny rooms where enslaved people were quartered when an owner stayed in the city. The cubicles were situated close to the slaveowners\u2019 apartments, and they could enter any time for any reason. We visit buildings with markers indicating that they were used for selling humans. Shana points out how the spaces and the laws that controlled the movement of enslaved people are the templates for contemporary carceral systems, and how the city\u2019s architecture reveals these spaces of confinement for those who look. Between 1804 and 1862, around 135,000 people were bought and sold in New Orleans. This number does not account for the unquantifiable \u2013 the love, kinship, and stability that was destroyed, and continues to haunt the present.",

Although white lawmakers attempted to control the practice, affluent Blacks could sometimes purchase their family members. In 1812, free people of color began buying parcels of land from Claude Trem\u00e9, who had inherited a retired plantation through his wife, Julie Moreau, who, as a woman, could not own property. The district named after Trem\u00e9, often referred to as the oldest neighborhood of free people of color in the U.S., served as a site of economic, cultural, political, social, and legal events that shaped the struggles of people of African descent in the South and across the United States. Trem\u00e9 was home to some of the city\u2019s most successful and talented black artisans, craftsmen, musicians, doctors, teachers, writers, revolutionary abolitionists, and activists. Today, some residents still live in houses built by their ancestors. The New Orleans Tribune, the first black daily newspaper in the U.S., was started by physician and publisher Louis Charles Roudanez, a resident of Trem\u00e9. During the Reconstruction era following the American Civil War, the residents of Trem\u00e9 and other neighborhoods engaged in advocacy efforts in the city and across the state to expand civil rights protections, increase access to schools, public institutions, employment opportunities, and integrated transportation systems.\u00a0 Once Reconstruction ended, and federal troops withdrew, Jim Crow laws reversed the gains Black residents had achieved in terms of equality, wealth access, legislative representation, and dignity. Our tour continues on the edge of Trem\u00e9, where Bienville Basin, a new \u201cmixed-income\u201d housing complex, has been fashioned from the destruction of an older low-income project, Iberville Public Housing. Shana lived here as a child. We stand near the renovated buildings with her. She lets us know the protocol: \u201cI am taking you in because I lived here, and then I will take you out.\u201d Social psychiatrist Mindy Fullilove uses the gardening term \u201croot shock\u201dMindy Thompson Fullilove, Root Shock: How Tearing Up City Neighborhoods Hurts America, and What We Can Do About It. New York, NY: One World/Ballantine Books, 2004. as a metaphor to describe the severe psychological damages Black communities suffered from being uprooted as a result of mid-twentieth-century urban renewal projects. Starting in the 1930s, integrated neighborhoods like the Trem\u00e9 began to be torn down through policies of slum clearance, and people were relocated from their familiar neighborhoods and into segregated public housing. The intersectional social bonds that characterized their former neighborhoods were torn apart. The houses that still stood suffered from neglect because investment redlining practices made it impossible for owners and new buyers to get loans. Shana describes to us four different \u201curban renewal\u201d projects in the Trem\u00e9 that have uprooted families and destroyed social cohesion. When Interstate 10 was built in the late 1960s, more homes were lost and 500 businesses had to close. I read that hundreds of ancient oak trees lining Claiborne Street, which led to the freeway, were uprooted and carried away. Reflecting beyond Shana\u2019s account of systematic localized forms of displacement, and guided by Fullilove\u2019s analysis, I imagine how New Orleans would have been impacted by the regressive policies of Reagan\u2019s 80s. U.S. cities during this period were slammed by the closure of mental health facilities, the halving of Section 8 housing subsidies,Peter Drier, Ronald Reagan\u2019s Legacy: Homelessness in America. Shelterforce, The Voice of Community Development. May 1, 2004. Accessed July 31, 2020. https://shelterforce.org/2004/05/01/reagans-legacy-homelessness-in-america/#:~:text=In%20his%20first%20year%20in,received%20federal%20housing%20subsidies%20declined. and covert federal-level entanglements with extranational cartels that led to the rampant distribution of highly addictive substances in the U.S. All of these factors would contribute to difficulties within any community, but they hit black communities the hardest. After Hurricane Katrina scoured New Orleans in 2005, even more public housing was razed, never to be replaced in the same numbers. Anthropologist Roberto Barrios writes about how, post-Hurricane Katrina, residents invited to planning sessions with city planners and architects \u201cdemanded that lightly damaged public housing be reopened immediately,\u201d to \u201cprioritize(d) the reinstatement of the city\u2019s pre-Katrina population\u2014especially renters and economically marginalized African Americans.\u201d Roberto Barrios, \u201cAnti-Resilience: Toward a Just and Accountable Gulf\u201d in Planet Drum Pulse, Summer 2020. \u00a0Shana\u2019s research emphasizes how black homeowners were discriminated against in the post-Hurricane Katrina period because their homes were often located in lower-lying areas and consequently were assessed below replacement value.

Fullilove asserts that when people are confronted by \u201cdisaster upon unmitigated disaster,\u201d with no chance for recovery, they lose hope and have no choice but to fend for themselves in any way they can. The legal fact of property ownership does not protect those whose lives and futures are considered disposable. \u201cThe soul demands freedom. If it cannot fight, it will argue. If it cannot argue or persuade it will dance. It will sing. If reason is denied, then art must arise. In a sense the Negro did not create jazz; he was jazz.\u201d  \u2014Edward Bland, The Cry of Jazz, 1959Ed Bland, \u201cThe Cry of Jazz\u201d in Film Culture, 1960: http://www.edblandmusic.com/Essays.htm It is dark when we reach our last stop, Congo Square, a commons used by enslaved and free people of color as a market and gathering place for music and dancing since the early French days. Haitian refugees also worshipped, drummed, and danced here. Congo Square is cited as the birthplace of jazz. Today it is enclosed within a 31-acre pleasure ground called Louis Armstrong Park, with gates that are locked each night at 6 p.m. Twelve blocks of residential housing were torn down to build the park.

We find the tribal community center, an insulated Quonset hut\u2013style building on tall piers, and climb up into a light-filled lodge and the exquisite smell of cooking food. In back, a kitchen bustles with people chatting and cooking. Geneva, who facilitated this meeting, greets us and describes the wonderful dishes they have made from seafood caught by tribal members: Shrimp opelousas, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, gumbo, and Brenda\u2019s famous baked fish. There is palpable pride in the room for the research they\u2019ve been doing into their heritage. The walls are covered with maps, informational posters, photographs, and books. Geneva introduces Theresa and Donald Dardar, Mary Verdin, Brenda Billiot, Christine Verdin, Earl Billiot, and others who have come for the gathering. We also meet Laura Kelley, a historian from Tulane who has worked with the tribe for over five years, bringing students to document oral histories and traditional knowledge\u2014crucial archival work that will contribute toward the tribe\u2019s bid for federal recognition. For generations, the Pointe-au-Chien have shrimped, crabbed, fished, trapped, and hunted for subsistence, supplemented by grazing beef cattle, foraging herbs and fruits, and cultivating gardens. Today, many members are also commercial fishers, boat pilots, and schoolteachers. Their tools are contemporary\u2014shrimp boats, seine nets, crab pots, and the internet\u2014but they are still bound by kinship to each other and the littoral landscape. Geneva describes for us the tribal governance and her current role in it; as part of the membership committee, she studies the genealogies of people associated with the tribe.

This interval of residency takes into account the flooding that has periodically displaced folks to other locations. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in our community who have moved to higher ground,\u201d Geneva says. \u201cBut they always move back.\u201d After introductions, we get to the delicious food, eating in small groups to hear stories about our hosts\u2019 children, fishing, tribe, and home.",

They say land is lost at the rate of a football field every hundred minutes\u2014a new increment of time to measure the velocities of change in the Anthropocene. Land disappears on a daily basis to erosion and subsidence, which is then exacerbated by storms and rising sea levels. The changes can be traced to policies that unleashed slow-moving, positive feedback loops of unnatural disaster, such as the Swamp Land Acts of 1849 and 1850, which turned federal wetlands over to states for agricultural use. Nathan Jessee, a PhD candidate studying the relocation process of the Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe, explains how those acts were \u201ccentral to Louisiana making property out of this \u2018uninhabitable swampland\u2019 and setting the stage for private property development and extractive industries to come in.\u201d In Louisiana, nine million acres of mixed wetlands were auctioned off for less than a dollar an acre, snapped up for timber and oil. Every canal that has ever been dredged through the swamp for logging, pipelines, construction, and exploration persists like an open wound, one that increases vulnerability to storm surges, hurricanes, erosion, and salt inundation. Every barrel of pumped oil augments the metabolic intensity at which the transformation proceeds. The engineering of the Mississippi River has also played a role\u2014\u201cstraightjacketing it,\u201d Laura Kelley says, referring to the leveeing and shortening of the river that eliminated the surges of sediment that once built land. The constitution and ecology of the water itself is changing; Geneva says the water was never salty enough for dolphins before. And the introduction of new compounds, such as Corexit 9500A, the solvent used after the BP oil spill in 2010, has intervened in the reproduction cycles of crabs and oysters.",

The recent installation of a new levee, lock and floodgate system part of a larger project to protect Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes from storms, will benefit the Pointe-au-Chien community. In contrast, the nearby Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe, who live outside of the levee system, has been preparing to relocate for almost two decades. Our bus crosses the levee via the two-lane Island Road, surrounded by open water dotted with oil and gas pipelines and pumping stations, and enters Isle de Jean Charles, a long strip of land with a smattering of homes belonging to tribal members. Since the 1950s, the band has lost 98 percent of their ancestral land, and now inhabits only a remnant\u2014a narrow spit surrounded by water. As with the Pointe-au-Chien, many families from Isle de Jean Charles have moved inland due to the extreme flooding, but in this case, it\u2019s clear they will never be able to move back. After undergoing a long-term study and design process, the Isle de Jean Charles band Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe applied for and was awarded a Federal grant for resettlement due to climate change- the first such community in the United States. They call their resettlement \u201ca living and active bridge from our ancestral Island, which is rapidly eroding, to a sustainable future.\u201d The new inland site will include a community center, seed library, museum, gathering areas, and housing to bring the tribe together around cultural regeneration.

Scattered among the low-lying wood-frame residences of tribal members are houses that were built more recently by what Geneva and Laura call \u201cweekend warriors.\u201d We also saw these vacation outposts on Bayou Pointe-au-Chien.\u00a0 Built on land purchased by outsiders, they are better maintained, well equipped with recreational toys, and stand higher off the ground. Geneva is irked by the weekend warriors. I witness her annoyance and try to make sense of it. Returning to the pier at Pointe-au-Chien, Geneva gestures toward an island that is home to the ancient mounds and burial sites of their ancestors. For the Pointe-au-Chien Tribe, the history and life of their territory has its own claims on them, to which they are accountable. The weekend warriors have the luxury of a vacation retreat to use for a few days of hunting and fishing with the boys. It barely constitutes a relationship, for they have no responsibility to the place, which in turn has no claims on them. For the Pointe-au-Chien, to maintain material relations with place and each other includes attending to the needs of the ecosystem. Last year, the tribe obtained a grant and organized volunteers to construct a massive artificial barrier reef of oyster shells to protect the ancestral mounds. The reef will also provide surfaces for oyster spat to attach to and develop on. To be cared for by place obligates reciprocity, in this case for ancestors and oyster kin. Both the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe and the Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe are legally recognized by Louisiana state as unique tribal peoples with long histories in this region. They are both currently immersed in the application process for federal recognition, a notoriously difficult process that can take as long as 30 years. To be acknowledged as a tribe on the federal level, they must compile detailed evidence of their membership, genealogies, treaties, language, and governance for each decade of the twentieth century. The application takes the form of a narrative drawn from maps, diaries, letters, oral histories, and other archival materials. The coveted designation of federal recognition make a tribe eligible for multiple support services and grants.\u00a0 While there is no equivalency between what Indigenous Peoples have lost and the assistance available through federal recognition, the acknowledgment process at least affords tribes access to resources that may mitigate historic harms. It can support them in transitioning the climate catastrophe and increase their capacities to thrive in the next times. For Black Americans, there is no application for the restitution of property they were swindled out of or forced to relinquish, or for the countless hours of stolen labor that augmented the wealth of others. There is no administrative process through which Black people can be aided in the restoration of languages and lost cultures. There is no recognition process that makes them eligible for reparations. Author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates writes in his essay about reparations that \u201cwe find the roots of American wealth and democracy \u2026 in the for-profit destruction of the most important asset available to any people, the family. The destruction was not incidental to America\u2019s rise; it facilitated that rise.\u201dTa-Nehisi Coates, \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d in The Atlantic, June 2014. Though there is currently no process for calculating reparations like the one used to recognize indigenous loss, the recognition process could be reconfigured to account for and become a witness to the unseen deprivation that underpins property. While identity is performed through and in place amid processes of living with place, making property is a violent and arbitrary operation inevitably drawn from European-colonial cultural mores of domination, individualism, and hierarchical entitlement. When Robert de La Salle claimed the Mississippi River Valley for France, he preemptively dismissed prior claims of other human and beyond-human inhabitants who already were using the land for their own purposes. When petroleum companies availed themselves of the marshes auctioned following the Swamp Act, they set cascades of devastation in motion\u2014the side effects of progress. Each of us is impacted by these side effects; they reach us through the mediums of air and water, and the effects of weather and infrastructure. They are embedded in the quotidian and the necessary; in access to food, housing, health, protection, community, and mobility. They surface as policy through the working of capital and as its externalities, and yet, they touch us differentially, in line with our identities, family histories and life trajectories.\u00a0 For two days, thirty-odd people have listened to the experiences of our guides. Being in proximity with each other on long bus rides and straggling walks, there has been time for introspection, sensing, conversation, reflection, and comparison. Who are our kin? Where do our reciprocal relationships lie? What infrastructures do we rely upon? How did we come to the place where we live, and through what stakes, claims, and losses? What are our \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d? We may share an understanding of property\u2019s injustices under capitalism, but we do not equally share their consequences. After two days of itinerancy, the seminar gathers in a large room to exchange impressions regarding how property is defined, made and unmade. Breakout groups grapple with the contradictions within ownership\u2019s promise of stability given the realities of dispossession. How might we configure relations that are founded upon mutual social responsibility, rather than upon forms of ownership that sever the lives of others? One group, meditating on the origins of property in possessive individualism, plays with the idea of \u201cmultiplying the subject,\u201d coming up with \u201cpossessive collectivism\u201d as, perhaps, a scaling up of the community land trust. I was thinking of this when I started this essay, but misremembered their term as \u201ccollective possession,\u201d which I thought of in the sense of a possession by beyond-humans, who could be either allies or demons, ancestors, or an ecosystem, a possession from outside the subject, that goes two ways. I imagined the reshaping of possession as multivalenced, having neither owned nor owner, but guided by a jurisprudence of reciprocity and radical equality. Before we had arrived in Terrebonne Parish, environmental photographer Ravi Agarwal had asked us to think about protocol as we enter the space of another. What attitudes were we coming with, what it is that we might take, and what it is that we might give in return? In our seminar wrap, Shana offered the idea of witnessing as an act of reciprocity. This is because witnessing takes labor. It takes commitment and energy to consider the circumstances of another. Perhaps this modest starting place can be the beginning of another kind of journey. In their performance work Viewing Hours (2019), Mayfield Brooks speaks about the unredeemed labor of witnessing: Mayfield Brooks, Viewing Hours, October 30, 2019. Originally performed at The Kitchen (NYC) April 6, 2019. After the viewing hours I would like you to commit to a practice of witnessing what you see. You are responsible to commit yourself to this practice as a move toward reparations, and as you know, repair work takes centuries. You and I will not live to see the repair work completed but you can still be a witness.   Thank you to co-conveners Morgan Adamson, Ravi Agarwal, Grace Treffinger, Shana M. griffin, and Bruce Braun for their brilliance, focus, and camaraderie, to Nathan Jessee for sharing his insights and research on the Isle de Jean Charles Band, to Geneva Lebeouf for her wisdom and time, and Carlina Ross\u00e9e for keeping the seminar on the rails.

                "text": "If you walk south from the Franklin Bridge in Minneapolis along the east bank of the Mississippi, you can pick up a rough trail that takes you under the towering Short Line Bridge, past stormwater outlets, to a small historic park. Here, if you are fortunate, you might see the remains of a long-forgotten lock and dam. I say \u201cfortunate\u201d because the dam is a ghostly presence. Completed in 1907, abandoned and largely destroyed in 1912, its remains lurk just beneath the surface. When water levels fall, often toward the end of summer, it seems to rise from the river, an apparition that disappears just as silently as it arrived. \u201cGhostly\u201d may be the wrong term. Or, if it is to be the right term, we will have to understand better what it is that returns. For ghosts return; they haunt. They must be attended to, be come to terms with. Which is to say that the Meeker Dam, as it is commonly known, is not just a ruin that occasionally presents itself to those who walk along the river\u2019s shore or to those who descend the recently restored wagon road from St. Paul, restored not long after the dam was placed on the National Registry of Historical Places in 2003. Nor is it merely a quaint reminder of the engineering feats of settlers or a charming remnant from past struggles between Minneapolis and St. Paul\u2014mediated far away in Washington D.C.\u2014over which city could rightly claim to be the head of navigation on the river.Bradley B. Meeker was a settler, property owner, and judge who served on the Minnesota Territorial Supreme Court from 1849 to \u201953. Eager to establish Minneapolis as the head of navigation on the Mississippi River and capture the site\u2019s potential hydropower, Meeker and a number of Minneapolis businessmen proposed building the dam at a site owned by Meeker. Accounts of the Meeker Dam can be found in John Anfinson, \u201cThe Secret History of the Mississippi\u2019s Earliest Locks and Dams,\u201d Minnesota History, vol. 54, no. 6 (1998): pp. 254\u201367. See also the Meeker Dam application form to the National Register of Historic Places (2003): https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/0564d3e0-d32b-4483-bbdc-23408bebf357/?branding=NRHP\u00a0 Rather, it represents the historical emergence of a new paradigm, a particular way of thinking about the Mississippi and its social and political futures, one that remains submerged in settler consciousness today, in the same way that the dam is submerged in the river\u2014as an absent presence that we see only poorly, refracted from beneath the surface of a now-placid river. For the Meeker Dam represents a settler vision and a settler spatiotemporality: the river imagined and remade as infrastructure on which the development of a settler society and the fortunes of an emerging industrial capitalism would rest. This is a vision that turns the river into a problem of engineering, fluid-mechanics, geology, and hydrology. It makes of it a puzzle to be solved: how to channel water, hold it back, let it flow at the right times and through the right spaces; how to move boats up a river that is too shallow, its drop too steep; how to regulate flows so that commodities can be moved to markets, investments realized, speculations in land made profitable. The river was remade within a spatiotemporal imagination that linked northern forests and farmer fields to distant markets that no logger or farmer had ever seen. Yet, if the remains of the Meeker Dam haunt us, it is perhaps for other reasons. For when the Meeker Dam was first proposed in 1852, the ink on the Treaty of Traverse des SiouxThe Treaty of Traverse des Sioux of 1851\u2014between the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of Dakota and the US Government\u2014ceded large tracts of Sioux territory along the Minnesota River to the US Government in exchange for annuities of cash and goods. Deception in the treaty negotiations, along with subsequent broken promises, contributed to the Dakota Uprising of 1862. had not yet dried, the Dakota Uprising was still a decade in the future, and the concentration camps established in the winter of 1862/63 at the confluence of Mnis\u00f3ta Wakp\u00e1 and \u021ea\u021f\u00e1wakpa\u2014a sacred site for the Dakota\u2014existed only as a latent potential within the violent expansion of settler colonialism. The Meeker Dam haunts us for what it embodies. Not just as the projection of an infrastructural vision, but the projection of such a vision when other territorialities, temporalities, and ontologies\u2014Dakota, Ho-Chunk, and Anishinaabe\u2014were present all around. Rising from its watery grave, the Meeker Dam forces us to ask what made it possible to imagine the river then as an industrial river, part of an emerging industrial capitalism that had only recently taken hold further to the east? What erasures were necessary, what ontologies, territorialities, and temporalities had to be willfully ignored, for the river to become the \u201cnation\u2019s river,\u201d subsumed within the taken-for-granted temporalities of a settler nation and its political and legal institutions? How was a settler futurity set in place and Indigenous futures rendered unimaginable? And what might it mean to reflect on this moment today, when the future of the river is again in play?",

                "text": "I am drawn to this site because it requires me to consider what remains in and what returns from the past. The dam was abandoned in 1912 because a much larger dam\u2014what is now known as Lock and Dam No. 1\u2014was built a few miles downstream, large enough to allow for navigation upriver to just below St. Anthony Falls, and with sufficient head to generate energy for the Ford Motors assembly plant that relocated there in 1925. In the following decades, almost 30 locks and dams would be built on the Upper Mississippi. Together with levees and dredging to control floods and enable larger barges, they produced an engineered river linked to industry and agriculture from Minneapolis all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, one which conformed to a geopolitical imagination that had no place for, or even consideration of, other temporalities and territorialities, other relations to water and land that did not follow the logic of settler law and property.Audra Simpson notes that settler colonialism proceeds without regard for \u201cother life forms, other sovereignties, other forms of political will.\u201d Audra Simpson, \u201cThe State is a Man: Theresa Spence, Loretta Saunders and the Gender of Settler Sovereignty,\u201d Theory &amp; Event, vol. 19, no. 4 (2016), para. 17: https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp2.lib.umn.edu/article/633280  Today, managed as an integrated system, the locks and dams capture and channel the energy of water toward particular ends rather than others, creating new social and ecological relations, subtending settler society and its industrial ecologies, and, in their day-to-day operations, obscuring and continuing the work of dispossession, oblivious to those or that which have been displaced. Indeed, what remains of the Meeker Dam is less the physical ruins of the dam itself than a political, economic, and ecological rationality that presupposes nation and state, one that imagines capitalist markets to be as natural as rivers, and one that projects and assumes a settler future as a matter of course, much as Meeker and his associates already did 167 years ago. The story of the Meeker Dam is thus not just about a dam and a river, but a world created around it, a bustling city built on the fruits of primitive accumulation and the depletion and degradation of northern forests, soils, and water. As residents of the Twin Cities, we inherit this river and its worlds, albeit in radically different and unequal ways. During periods of low water, when the Meeker Dam appears to rise from its watery grave, it reminds us that the urban worlds we take for granted are built upon and carry forward these settler temporalities, spatialities, and ecologies. But what does it mean to say that we inherit the Meeker Dam, when this \u201cwe\u201d is defined by the benefits derived from Indigenous dispossession? What responsibilities does this demand? We might begin by noting that benefits are derived unevenly, that in the context of forced migration, immigrant exclusion, relocation, and chattel slavery, not all non-Indigenous residents are settlers in the same way.See Iyko Day, \u201cBeing or Nothingness: Indigeneity, Antiblackness, and Settler Colonial Critique,\u201d Critical Ethnic Studies, vol. 1, no. 2 (2015): pp. 102\u201321. We might continue, as Potawatomi scholar Kyle Whyte proposes, by refusing to deny that as settlers, we live in what our ancestors could have only seen as fantasy times. Whyte notes that for centuries, European colonists and settlers were unable to dominate the Native alliances in the region, and \u201cwould have relished the very idea that they could advance whatever business interests they wanted without facing threats of empowered resistance and diplomacy. They would have delighted in the idea that their legal orders would not have had to bend to or accommodate Indigenous legal orders.\u201dKyle Whyte, \u201cIndigenous Science (Fiction) for the Anthropocene: Ancestral Dystopias and Fantasies of Climate Change Crises,\u201d Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space, vol. 1, no. 1\u20132 (2018): pp. 224\u201342, here p. 237. Even for Meeker, confidently projecting a future of river commerce and white settlement, the world we inhabit today would have seemed a fictional utopia. Dakota resistance had not ended and would only become more vigorous. Settler law and property were far from settled, and the river did not bend easily to the desires of investors and engineers. When construction of Meeker\u2019s dam was finally begun, long after Meeker himself was dead, engineers struggled to control the force of the river, resulting in cycles of destruction, redesign, and repair. Whyte asks us to see our present as continuous with this past, indeed, founded on it. Borrowing his language, we might say that infrastructures built in the past \u201cwere constructed to provide privileges to the builder\u2019s descendants. They were gifts of a troubling sort.\u201dIbid., p. 237. Draw up a list of Minnesota\u2019s Fortune 500 companies, its many co-ops, or its public institutions like the University of Minnesota, where I teach and write, perched above the river gorge. Built on past and present dispossession, these institutions\u2014private, cooperative, and public alike\u2014presuppose and often extend the displacements of settler law and violence, quietly folding past appropriations into the present, benefitting from the \u201cnatural\u201d workings of property and market and the infrastructural and institutional environments that today appear as nothing more than sites and effects of \u201cgood governance.\u201d This is what Whyte asks us to consider. If the Meeker Dam haunts, it is not only because it reminds us about a past where the future was not assured, but because when it rises from its watery grave, it brings that past into the present, it reminds us that if we look beneath the surface and allow ourselves to see what remains, we see that we are still fully within this history as an ongoing process. The Meeker Dam is (in) our present.Audra Simpson reminds us that \u201cstructures move through time and place and if you pay close attention, you can actually see structural activity.\u201d Simpson, \u201cThe State is a Man\u201d, para. 20. Today, as the US Army Corps of Engineers considers the disposition of the locks and dams in the Twin Cities, and as proposals to \u201crewild\u201d the river gain traction, we do well to reflect on what remains and what returns from this past. But it is also critical that as settlers we refuse to assign Indigenous sovereignty and resistance to the past. As Jean O\u2019Brien, scholar of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, notes, the view that settler colonialism has an eliminatory nature may be correct, but it problematically \u201cpulls toward the notion of extinction,\u201d when what is needed is an understanding of \u201cthe continuance and survival of Indigenous sovereignty.\u201dJean O\u2019Brien, \u201cTracing Settler Colonialism\u2019s Eliminatory Logic in Traces of History,\u201d American Quarterly, vol. 69, no. 2 (2017): pp. 249\u201355, here p. 251. Just as Dakota resistance had not ended when Meeker proposed his dam, it has not ended today. Whether through the construction of the Bdote Memory Map, the work of the Healing Place Collaborative, demands to remove Sam Durant\u2019s gallows sculpture from the Walker Art Center\u2019s sculpture garden, the insistence on remembering Indigenous sites like Spirit Island, or the work of Water Protectors along the route of the Line 3 pipeline in Northern Minnesota, Indigenous futurities are multiple and exist in the now, while settler futures are not as assured as they may seem. Perhaps this is what the ruins of the Meeker Dam surface tell us: not only that we inherit its troubling gift, albeit in different ways, but that the river we inherit\u2014this Anthropocene River that is also a settler-colonial river\u2014is not the only river or the last river. Other rivers, other sovereignties, other futures are already here, have been all along, and are still to be invented.",

                "text": "Indian Lake was created by retreating glaciers, like many of the natural features in what is today southwestern Wisconsin. Sitting halfway between Lake Mendota in Madison and the Wisconsin River at Sauk City, the shallow 64-acre kettle lake is the centerpiece of Indian Lake County Park, which is one of Dane County\u2019s largest parks at 483 acres. Indian Lake also sits on the boundary between a glaciated and unglaciated landscape. If you are moving westward, the park serves as a gateway to the Driftless Area, a hilly region characterized by the absence of glacial drift. \u201cThe Driftless is an anomaly,\u201d writes conservation biologist Curt Meine. \u201cThrough the recurring episodes of Pleistocene glaciation\u2014seventeen pulses of expansion and shrinkage over two and a half million years\u2014ice hemmed in the Driftless on all sides at one time or another but left its interior ice-free.\u201dCurt Meine, \u201cThe Edge of Anomaly\u201d in Wildness: Relations of People and Place, edited by Gavin Van Horn and John Hausdoerffer, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2017, 36.Frederic G. Cassidy, Dane County Place-Names, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2009, 78. Indian Lake was created by retreating glaciers and named after Indians. According to Frederic Cassidy, whose book, Dane County Place-Names, was first published in 1947, the lake was named \u201cfor the Winnebago Indians, who frequented it for hunting and fishing before and for many years after the coming of the whites.\u201d The name \u201cIndian L\u201d first appeared on a map in 1873. It was labeled Hororah Lake on a map created in 1838, two years after Wisconsin became a territory. Today, a sign on the southeast shore provides a brief overview of Indian Lake\u2019s glacial origins. \u201cThe steep slopes of exposed rock indicate that this valley was never completely covered with ice,\u201d the sign reads. \u201cYet the large boulders found in the draws and on the valley floor could only have been brought here by a finger of ice, which fanned out from the main body of the glacier.\u201d Shifting from a geologic to human time scale, the sign also notes, \u201cFor several hundred years Indians camped at the southwest end of the lake. During that period, the slopes on this hills above you were quite open and covered with prairie grasses and wildflowers. Frequent fast-moving prairie fires helped keep these areas free of trees. When settlers stopped the fires, trees began to fill in open spaces. Today only a few small patches of prairie remain on the very dry southwest-facing slopes.\u201d Erected in 1977, this sign is part of the Dane County Natural History Marker System. The sign differs, albeit subtly, from Dane County and Wisconsin Historical Markers, examples of which can also be found at the park. This particular sign contributes to a pattern among settlers of narrating Indian history within the context of natural history\u2014associating Indigenous peoples with \u201cnature\u201d\u2014that has a similar cumulative effect to other rhetorical strategies like \u201cfirsting\u201d and \u201clasting,\u201d identified by Jean O\u2019Brien, which assert \u201cas a fact the claim that Indians can never be modern.&#8221;Jean O\u2019Brien, Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians out of Existence in New England, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2010, 107. Although it was named after a group of Winnebago Indians, the lake is associated with a particular Indian, Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak, a Sauk leader more commonly known as Black Hawk, who passed along the shores of Indian Lake one fateful afternoon in July of 1832. Another sign near a boat landing on the northwest end of Indian Lake, explains the connection between Indian Lake and the Black Hawk War. \u201cOn July 21, 1832, during the Black Hawk War, Sac Indian leader Black Hawk and his band left Pheasant Branch, west of Madison, retreating ahead of the military forces commanded by Colonels Ewing and Dodge. The band fled north following a route past the west end of Indian Lake and turned westward down the broad valley now bisected by Highway 12. The military, despite rain and exhausted horses, managed to catch up to Black Hawk\u2019s warriors late that afternoon at the Heights overlooking the Wisconsin River.\u201d This second sign was erected by the Dane County Historical Society in 1997 to commemorate the 165th anniversary of the so-called war. Apparently it was one of the first of nearly three dozen historical markers installed that summer along the \u201cBlack Hawk Trail\u201d in Wisconsin. A newsletter from the organization notes that the \u201cIndian Lake Passage\u201d sign marks \u201ca portion of the escape route of Black Hawk.\u201dDane County Historical Society Newsletter 26, no. 2 (Summer 2007), 2. Indian Lake was created by retreating glaciers and is now associated with retreating Indians. Positioned at opposite ends of the glacial lake, the two signs narrate stories of retreat that intersect in unexpected ways, and also resonate with more explicitly colonial place-names such as the tiny towns of Retreat and Victory, Wisconsin, situated near the Mississippi River where the Black Hawk War climaxed in a massacre. The two signs also tell origin stories\u2014geologic origins and settler origins\u2014stories about deep time and modern time. How are we to make sense of the juxtaposition of these seemingly incommensurable time scales? What happens when a fleeting \u201cpassage\u201d or temporary \u201cencampment\u201d is positioned next to an event\u2014a glacial retreat, in this case\u2014that unfolded over thousands of years? Or for that matter, how does it square with the \u201cmany years\u201d (including up to the present-day) that Ho-Chunk have hunted and fished at Indian Lake? What is the relationship between these inexorable movements and transformative structures? The two signs seem to link deep time and modern time, while cutting out something in between, perhaps \u201ctime immemorial.\u201d If \u201cplaying Indian\u201d is a way for settlers to seize Indigeneity and claim Native land, as historians Phil Deloria and Jean O\u2019Brien have argued, perhaps playing geologist\u2014partly by listening to these common glacial origin stories\u2014is a way of seizing deep time, undercutting 10,000+ years of grounded knowledge and political authority, and rendering Indigenous peoples as immigrants\u2014one part of a \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d\u2014without sovereign claims to the land. These intersecting origin stories also stretch \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d into the deep past, where glaciers become the original plows that broke the plains. In 1837, geologist Louis Agassiz wrote, \u201cThe glacier was God\u2019s great plough; and when the ice vanished from the face of the land, it left it prepared for the hand of the husbandman.\u201dLouis Agassiz, \u201cIce-Period in America,\u201d The Atlantic Monthly 14 (July 1864), 93. Writing in 1914 about the unfolding revolution in Mexico, B.F. Butterfield opined, \u201cIt seems to me that the greatest legacy the human race enjoys, next to the planet itself, is the work of the Great Glacier, which once covered northern Europe and America. It smoothed the plains for the plow, broke up the rocks, powdered the soil, and left navigable river and useful lakes.\u201dB.F. Butterfield, \u201cEvils of Mexico\u2019s Old Regime,\u201d The Public XVII, no. 857 (September 4, 1914), 850. There are a number of places along the Black Hawk Trail where glacial and settler origin stories collide, including Boaz, Pier County Park, and Madison\u2019s Observatory Drive. This conjunction can be found, too, in many historical and geographical accounts of Wisconsin. In his essay, \u201cThe View from Man Mound,\u201d Curt Meine notes the abundance of effigy mounds in what is now Wisconsin\u2014an estimated 15,000-20,000 mounds at the time of European contact. \u201cThey were as distinguishing an attribute of the Wisconsin landscape as its glacial features. No other part of North America had so rich a concentration of these ancient earthworks.\u201dCurt Meine, \u201cThe View from Man Mound,\u201d in The Vanishing Present: Wisconsin\u2019s Changing Lands, Waters, and Wildlife, edited by Donald M. Waller and Thomas P. Rooney, eds. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008), 17. But this convergence of glacial and settler stories is not unique to the Black Hawk War, nor to Wisconsin. Indeed, these intersecting stories can be found throughout the Meskonsing-Kansan region, including at Iowa Point in Kansas.",

                "text": "View from the Ice Age Trail @ Indian Lake The two signs\u2014on opposite ends of Indian Lake\u2014are linked by a three-mile segment of the nearly 1,200 mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail, which was established by Act of Congress in 1980. The winding footpath traces the maximum extent of the Wisconsinan Glaciation, which occurred about 20,000 years ago. For the most part, the trail follows end moraines through Wisconsin, a state that has arguably\u2014at least if you ask a Cheesehead\u2014been sculpted more than any other by the colossal ice sheets of the last Ice Age. The fact that the most recent of the great Ice Ages of the Pleistocene Epoch, which ended only about 10,000 years ago, is named the Wisconsin Glacial Episode or Wisconsinan Glaciation, attests to its profound effects on the landscape that would become in 1848 the State of Wisconsin. It\u2019s significant, too, that the name of this glacial episode was derived from the name of a state that in turn was derived from the name of a river that was derived from an Indigenous place-name. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, \u201cWisconsin (originally Meskonsing) is the English spelling of a French version of a Miami Indian name for a river that runs 430 miles through the center of our state, currently known as the Wisconsin River.\u201d The society also declares with conviction, \u201cOur state\u2019s name, supported by geological evidence, means \u2018river running through a red place.\u2019\u201d\u201cWisconsin\u2019s Name: Where it Came From and What it Means,\u201d Wisconsin Historical Society, https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS3663 This is another example of projecting settlement backwards into deep time\u2014another example of Glacial Manifest Destiny. And it is echoed by the obscure and twisting story, detailed in the first chapter, of glacial nomenclature as applied to the Kansan Glaciation, the Independence Glaciation, and the Pre-Illinoian Glaciations, as the Early and Middle Pleistocene Glaciations are now known to scientists. The 3-mile Indian Lake Segment, according to the Ice Age Trail Guidebook, \u201chighlights charming Indian Lake County Park and its wooded, hilly terrain.\u201d Perhaps to heighten the charm, the segment also features a \u201cPoetry Trail.\u201d Snippets of nature poetry are sprinkled throughout the woods on small weathered signs, some of which are now partially covered with lichen. \u201cThe Path That Leads to Nowhere\u201d by Corinne Rooseveit Robinson; \u201cLeisure\u201d by Welsh poet William Henry Davies; \u201cMay Day\u201d by Sara Teasdale; \u201cFar From the Madding Crowd\u201d by Nixon Waterman; \u201cA Vagabond Song\u201d by Canadian poet Bliss Carman. And, of course, \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d by Robert Frost. Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014 I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. At a trail junction near the Frost sign, another sign\u2014this one bright red\u2014warns hikers that they are going the WRONG WAY. In fact, according to the sign, going in either direction from the junction is WRONG, which seems to foreclose the possibility of taking the one less traveled\u2026Irony aside, the warning sign invites deeper reflection on the many divergences and convergences at Indian Lake County Park, where the Black Hawk Trail overlaps with the Ice Age Trail. There are of course many more layers of history at Indian Lake, including stories of German immigration and settler colonization, but the conjunction of glacial and settler origins stories is what immediately stands out. Fabu Phillis Carter\u2019s short poem, \u201cMacaja Revels Camped at a Stream of Water,\u201d is not featured on the \u201cPoetry Trail.\u201d Published in 2013 by the former poet laureate of Madison, known professionally as Fabu, \u201cMacaja Revels\u201d is about a young black man, born on the Cherokee Reservation in North Carolina in 1800, who migrated to Dane County. The last verse reads: Who remembers Macaja Revels, Black settler in the 1800\u2019s Who camped at a refreshing stream Eighteen miles north of the village of Madison but moved on, maybe knowing there would be no welcome in Madison. Who remembers that Black people came to Wisconsin to be free?Fabu, \u201cMacaja Revels Camped at a Stream of Water,\u201d in Echolocations: Poets Map Madison, edited by Sarah Busse, Shoshauna Shy, and Wendy Vardaman (Middleton: Cowfeather Press, 2013), 153, https://versewisconsin.org/Issue113/water/fabu.html Indian Lake County Park is about eighteen miles north of the city of Madison. It\u2019s possible Revels camped at the same location\u2014the southwest end of the lake\u2014where Indians camped for several hundred years. The outlet of Indian Lake is still a refreshing stream. And the lake is also on the way to Cheyenne Valley, Wisconsin\u2019s largest rural African American settlement in the 19th century, which is the \u201celsewhere\u201d referenced in the poem. Macaja Revels, born in 1800 on the Cherokee reservation migrated to Dane county and camped at a stream of water eighteen miles north of the village of Madison. Macaja traveled on to buy land elsewhere.Fabu, 153 Fabu\u2019s poem was inspired by a brief notation about Revels in Black Settlers in Rural Wisconsin, a booklet published by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction in 1983. Who remembers Macaja? Fabu asks. Who, indeed, remembers his brief \u201cpassage\u201d and \u201cencampment\u201d at Indian Lake? And how does the meaning of that passage change when we recognize Macaja as a Black and Native man? Apparently Macaja, who learned about Bad Axe\u2014now Vernon\u2014County from land posters and by word of mouth, \u201cpitched his tent near the center of Town 14 Range 1 West,\u201d eventually taking up 160 acres. How does the meaning shift when we consider the extent to which Macaja\u2019s own journey was entangled with processes of Indian removal in both the Southeast and what was then the Northwest? And obviously entangled with slavery in the South, but also with bondage in the Illinois-Wisconsin lead district.Jennifer Kirsten Stinson, \u201cBondage and resistance in the land of lead: antebellum Upper Mississippi River Valley mineral country landscapes,\u201d Slavery &amp; Abolition 38, no. 1 (2017), 6-22; Jennifer Kirsten Stinson, \u201cBecoming Black, White, and Indian in Wisconsin Farm Country, 1850s\u20131910s,\u201d Middle West Review 2, no. 2 (Spring 2016), 53-84. How does the Ice Age Trail itself\u2014as a spatial narrative\u2014change if we insert Fabu\u2019s poem on the \u201cPoetry Trail\u201d? Might it be a way of connecting the Ice Age Trail and the Black Hawk Trail to the Cheyenne Valley Heritage Trail? Might it open up views of at least a few of the \u201cBillion Black Anthropocenes,\u201d which, according to geographer Kathryn Yusoff, \u201cnames the all too many voidings of experiences that span multiple scales, manifestations, and ongoing extractive economies,\u201d and recognizes the \u201cthe proximity of black and brown bodies to harm.\u201dKathryn Yusoff, A Billion Black Anthropocenes or None, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2018, xiv, xii. Might it also reveal something about Black and Native visions of self-determination? Might it point to more concrete examples of restorative justice and land justice, such as the Black Family Land Trust in North Carolina, the Native Land Conservancy in Massachusetts, and the Sogorea Te\u2019 Land Trust in the San Francisco Bay Area. At the very least, inserting Fabu\u2019s voice on the \u201cPoetry Trail\u201d should make clear Yusoff\u2019s claim that \u201cno geology is neutral.\u201dYusoff, 108.",

                "text": "Ice Age Trail / Convergence #2 The National Park Service brochure and map for the Ice Age Trail sets the scene: \u201cWisconsin\u2019s legacy from the glaciers and meltwater streams of the Ice Age is a landscape of great diversity and beauty. The State\u2019s many lakes and ponds, forested hills and ridges, and gently rolling farmlands remind us of the glacier\u2019s visit and beckon us to come, explore, and enjoy!\u201d At Indian Lake, the Ice Age Trail doesn\u2019t just follow the maximum extent of the Wisconsinan Glaciation and mark the boundary between a glaciated and unglaciated landscape. The trail isn\u2019t just backward-looking, highlighting only past events and processes. It\u2019s not simply about \u201cthe glacier\u2019s visit.\u201d The Ice Age Trail also maps the Anthropocene\u2014perhaps unwittingly. In this way, it is forward-looking, highlighting ongoing and future events, processes, and possibilities. The Ice Age Trail is still under construction, literally and metaphorically. Like many of the other National Scenic Trails, the IAT was (and still is being) cobbled together from an existing network of trails and roads. If we think of trails as spatial narratives, we can appreciate how the IAT was also (and still is being) cobbled together from existing narratives. These narratives, including settler origin stories, are part of the glaciated landscapes along with the kettle ponds and terminal moraines. They are all part of Wisconsin\u2019s legacy and part of our inheritance. And they beckon us to do more than just come, explore, and enjoy. Over its 1,200 miles, the Ice Age Trail intersects numerous other trails, including the Military Ridge Trail, Badger State Trail, Glacial Drumlin Trail, Tuscobia Trail, and Gandy Dancer Trail. It also intersects other forms of visible and invisible infrastructure, including highways, transmission lines, and pipelines. For example, the IAT intersects four Enbridge oil pipelines (Lines 6A 13, 14, 61) near the towns of Gilman, Portage, and Whitewater. These points of intersection are \u201chot spots,\u201d a term geographer Shiloh Krupar uses to denote \u201can area where something resides unassimilated, unmetabolized, and thus remains productively troubling and politically open.\u201dShiloh R. Krupar, Hot Spotter\u2019s Report: Military Fables of Toxic Waste, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2013, 16. Of course, these hot spots involve not only physical infrastructure but also discursive infrastructure, including interpretive infrastructure like historical markers, monuments, and scenic byways. Reflecting on ubiquitous historical markers, historian Christine DeLucia writes, \u201cThese signs ought to be understood not as factual articulations of history but as environmental tools of colonial persuasion, memory devices intended to orient and direct the sight lines of English-speaking people to a very specific landscape. It is a landscape of ongoing Indigenous dispossession and settler colonial conquest that smooths over its ragged, violent edges by encoding these contested processes within vistas designed for scenic enjoyment.\u201dChristine DeLucia, \u201cAn \u2018Indian Fishing Weir\u2019 at Musketaquid: Marking Northeastern Indigenous Homelands and Colonial Memoryscapes,\u201d Environmental History 23, no. 1 (January 2018), 2. Places like Indian Lake and Iowa Point, where glacial and settler origin stories collide, are excellent examples of hot spots, in part because the historical markers there are not all that persuasive. This is all to suggest that \u201cwe\u201d participate\u2014and can participate more intentionally and perhaps more forcefully\u2014in the ongoing construction of the Ice Age Trail and Anthropocene Age Trail. \u201cHot spots\u201d need to be activated\u2014or productively troubled\u2014in order to remain \u201cpolitically open,\u201d and to counter myriad forces\u2014settler colonial, anti-black, and white supremacist\u2014that seek to contain them. By cobbling together different trails and highlighting other intersections, we can tell different stories. Or perhaps \u201cwe\u201d can hear other stories, ones that have been told over and over for generations. What might we hear if we connect the Ice Age Trail to the Black Hawk Trail, the Cheyenne Valley Heritage Trail, and the Kickapoo River Canoe Trail? Or rather, what will be heard when \u201cwe\u201d recognize that these trails are already connected?",

But of what use are these terms? Why quibble over the distinctions between them, let alone the differences between other terms such as the Capitalocene, Plantationocene, or the Chthulucene? The Anthropocene is inherently colonial and anti-black. It \u201cbegan with widespread colonialism and slavery,\u201d as Simon Lewis and Mark Maslin argue.Simon L. Lewis and Mark A. Maslin, The Human Planet: How We Created the Anthropocene, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2018, 13. To call it the (colonial) Anthropocene or (A Billion Black) Anthropocenes is therefore redundant. Yet it seems necessary. Heather Davis and Zoe Todd\u2019s question\u2014\u201dwhat can we do with [the Anthropocene] as a conceptual apparatus that may serve to undermine the conditions that it names?\u201d\u2014has been taken up in different and generative ways by Anna Spice, Kyle Powys Whyte, Macarena G\u00f3mez-Barris, Kathryn Yusoff, Anna Tsing, Donna Haraway, and many others.Heather Davis and Zoe Todd, \u201cOn the Importance of a Date, or Decolonizing the Anthropocene,\u201d ACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies 16, no. 4 (2017), 763, https://www.acme-journal.org/index.php/acme/article/view/1539 We [Indigenous feminists] start from the basic premise that the environmental disaster we now face has its roots in a prior and continuing apocalypse, in the attempted elimination of Indigenous worlds. The source of the toxicity, industrial capitalism, itself has roots in colonialism and imperialism. Forget the \u201cgolden spike\u201d or the other geological markers of the \u201canthropocene.\u201d Forget the technoscientific attempts to locate the tipping point for global pollution and climate change. The first steps toward environmental disaster were the first steps of colonizers on our lands. Colonization is the foundation of environmental decline. What is the state of our land, air, and water? Of our other-than-human relations? Before the chemical analysis and the radiation count and the environmental assessments and the soil samples and the EPA and the toxic burdens and the acceptable chemical thresholds. What is the state of our land, air, and water? Stolen. It was stolen. And it has not been returned. \u2013\u2013Anne Spice, \u201cProcessing Settler Toxicities: Part I\u201dAnne Spice, \u201cProcessing Settler Toxicities: Part I,\u201d Footnotes (June 16, 2018), https://footnotesblog.com/2018/06/16/processing-settler-toxicities-part-i We argue that placing the golden spike at 1610, or from the beginning of the colonial period, names the problem of colonialism as responsible for contemporary environmental crisis. If the Anthropocene is already here, the question then becomes, what can we do with it as a conceptual apparatus that may serve to undermine the conditions that it names? One could object that by dating the Anthropocene to colonialism we are undoing the critical and creative work that has been done to name the problem of colonialism and its power differentials because the Anthropocene, as a term, erases these questions of power. Indeed, many people in the humanities have pointed out the failure of the Anthropocene, as a concept, to adequately account for power relations. Instead, all humans are equally implicated under the sign of the \u2018anthropos.\u2019 But rather than abandon the term because of these connections, we feel that the Anthropocene betrays itself in its name: in its reassertion of universality, it implicitly aligns itself with the colonial era. By making the relations between the Anthropocene and colonialism explicit, we are then in a position to understand our current ecological crisis and to take the steps needed to move away from this ecocidal path. \u2013\u2013Heather Davis and Zoe Todd, \u201cOn the Importance of a Date, or Decolonizing the Anthropocene\u201dDavis and Todd, 763. Not all humans are equally implicated in the forces that created the disasters driving contemporary human-environmental crises, and I argue that not all humans are equally invited into the conceptual spaces where these disasters are theorized or responses to disaster formulated. \u2013\u2013Zoe Todd, \u201cIndigenizing the Anthropocene\u201dZoe Todd, \u201cIndigenizing the Anthropocene,\u201d in Art in the Anthropocene: Encounters Among Aesthetics, Politics, Environment and Epistemology, edited by Heather Davis and Etienne Turpin, London: Open Humanities Press, 2015, 241-254. By using the term \u2018colonial Anthropocene\u2019 I attend to planetary climate change and environmental destruction as a spatial and temporal structure with accelerating consequences, one that spans more than five centuries of colonial domination. If we consider the non-degradable impact of its refuse, tracking coloniality allows us to not only dig into the Earth\u2019s archive of destruction, but also to make visible how the planet and local human and nonhuman communities are dramatically reshaped by it in the foreseeable future. In the era of climate science and species annihilation, we must continually make evident how industrial environmental damage was first organized by colonialism, its extractive project, and its desire to rapaciously rule over and decimate specific territories and peoples it constituted through difference. The terminology of A Billion Black Anthropocenes offers an explosion of the singular and names the racial logic that underpins planetary crises. Using the term colonial Anthropocene achieves something similar, namely to destabilize how knowledge about ecological crisis is temporalized, spatialized, and already locked within a regime of what Anibal Quijano first termed the coloniality of power. \u2013\u2013Macarena G\u00f3mez-Barris, \u201cThe Colonial Anthropocene: Damage, Remapping, and Resurgent Resources\u201dMacarena G\u00f3mez-Barris, book review essay, \u201cThe Colonial Anthropocene: Damage, Remapping, and Resurgent Resources,\u201d Antipode (March 19, 2019), https://antipodefoundation.org/2019/03/19/the-colonial-anthropocene If the Anthropocene proclaims a sudden concern with the exposures of environmental harm to white liberal communities, it does so in the wake of histories in which these harms have been knowingly exported to black and brown communities under the rubric of civilization, progress, modernization, and capitalism. The Anthropocene might seem to offer a dystopic future that laments the end of the world, but imperialism and ongoing (settler) colonialisms have been ending worlds for as long as they have been in existence. The Anthropocene as a politically infused geology and scientific/popular discourse is just now noticing the extinction it has chosen to continually overlook in the making of its modernity and freedom. \u2013\u2013Kathryn Yusoff, A Billion Black Anthropocenes or NoneYusoff, xiii. Debates about the start of the Anthropocene are often framed in temporal rather than spatial terms. When did it begin, we ask, not where? Dates, when put forth, are typically singular rather than plural. The Anthropocene started in either 1492, 1610, 1619, or 1950. It didn\u2019t start in all these, plus a million other times and places. Reflecting on what is at stake in these debates, Heather Davis and Zoe Todd argue \u201cthat placing the golden spike at 1610, or from the beginning of the colonial period, names the problem of colonialism as responsible for contemporary environmental crisis.\u201dDavis and Todd, 763. They also acknowledge, \u201cOur interest in the \u2018golden spike\u2019 is a pragmatic one, in so far as it ties the Anthropocene to colonialism.\u201dDavis and Todd, 769. The Anthropocene Age Trail asks not when did the (colonial) Anthropocene begin, but, instead, where is it most visible? And where, how, and by whom is it felt most intensely? Part of our interest in the AAT as a conceptual apparatus is pragmatic, in so far as it ties the Anthropocene to colonialism in place(s). Black Hawk War of 1832 It\u2019s a bit odd, and perhaps ironic, to think about the Anthropocene in terms of golden spikes. As Manu Karuka notes, \u201cThe golden spike did not suture the Union after the Civil War; it symbolically finalized the industrial infrastructure of a continental empire where none had existed before.\u201dManu Karuka, Empire\u2019s Tracks: Indigenous Nations, Chinese Workers, and the Transcontinental Railroad, Berkeley: University of California Press, 2019, xiv. But if you wanted to place a golden spike to mark the start of the Anthropocene in the Upper Midwest\u2014or, from 1787\u20131803, the Old Northwest Territory\u2014the confluence of the Bad Axe and Mississippi Rivers would be an ideal location. The Bad Axe Massacre, which took place near the confluence on August 1-2, 1832, ended what quickly became known as the \u201clast Indian war east of the Mississippi River,\u201d and inaugurated an era of massive change to physical, cultural, and political landscapes. A newsletter from the Dane County Historical Society summed it up: \u201cWithout an Indian war threat, Wisconsin Territory was created just four years later and rapid settlement produced statehood in 1848.\u201dDane County Historical Society Newsletter 26, no. 2 (Summer 2007), 2. The genocidal war unleashed a new phase of regional settler colonization, and justified an aggressive campaign of removal of the northern Indian Nations, including the Ho-Chunk, Meskwaki, Iowa, and Kickapoo Nations. Historian Jeffrey Ostler argues, \u201cAfter the Bad Axe Massacre, federal officials seized the moment to separate Indians from their lands. Whether they had supported Black Hawk, remained neutral, or assisted the United States government made no difference.\u201dJeffrey Ostler, Surviving Genocide: Native Nations and the United States from the American Revolution to Bleeding Kansas, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2019, 307. Beginning in 1832, the Ho-Chunk suffered multiple removals\u2014from Wisconsin to Iowa, Minnesota, Dakota Territory, and Nebraska. Of course, some Ho-Chunk refused to be removed, and remained in or returned to each of these places. The Black Hawk War is often described by settlers as \u201ca brief conflict\u201d since it technically lasted only four months. But others, including Black Hawk himself, insist that the war began much earlier, and also lasted much longer. Ostler, for example, connects the war to the \u201cjust and lawful wars\u201d clause in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. \u201cWhen they stated a capacity to crush Black Hawk\u2019s people like a piece of dirt and cause them to cease to exist or when they called for their extermination, government and military officials did not cite the 1787 Northwest Ordinance\u2019s authorization of \u2018just and lawful wars.\u2019 Nonetheless, officials were clearly operating on the assumption, embedded in that foundational legislation, that it was legal and just to prosecute genocidal war against \u2018savages\u2019 who resisted \u2018civilization\u2019s\u2019 demands.\u201dOstler, Surviving Genocide, 307. According to Black Hawk, the 1832 war was precipitated by the 1804 Treaty of St. Louis, which ceded more than 50 million acres of Indigenous land. In his autobiography, published a year after the war, Ma-Ka-Tai-Me-She-Kia-Kiak, or Black Hawk reflected on the ramifications of the treaty and the dubious circumstances surrounding its signing: \u201cThis was all myself and nation knew of the treaty of 1804. It has since been explained to me. I found by that treaty, that all of the country east of the Mississippi, and south of Jeffreon was ceded to the United States for one thousand dollars a year. I will leave it to the people of the United States to say whether our nation was properly represented in this treaty? Or whether we received a fair compensation for the extent of country ceded by these four individuals? I could say much more respecting this treaty, but I will not at this time. It has been the origin of all our serious difficulties with the whites.\u201dBlack Hawk, Autobiography of Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak, or Black Hawk, St. Louis: Continental Printing Co., 1882, 23. Today, visitors to Black Hawk State Historic Site in present-day Rock Island are confronted by a small boulder inscribed with a simple message from the Sac &amp; Fox Nation: \u201cIn memory of the Fraudulent Treaty of 1804.\u201d In the early 1800s, this place was known as Saukenuk and it was home to as many as 6,000 Indigenous people. This boulder is a physical manifestation of what Nick Estes calls the \u201cpolitical practice of return, restoration, and reclamation of belonging and place,\u201d which, invoking Audra Simpson, is structured by a \u201crefusal to accept the impossible condition of banishment and disappearance from one\u2019s homelands, and outright dispossession.\u201dNick Estes, Our History Is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance, New York: Verso Book, 2019, 248. We might also interpret this boulder as erratic from the colonial Anthropocene. Views from the Black Hawk Trail Wisconsin\u2019s Black Hawk Trail\u2014stretching from Beloit to Bad Axe\u2014was established in 1997-98 to mark the 165th anniversary of the Black Hawk War and also the 150th anniversary of the statehood that war enabled. At that time the War Trail Coalition, based in Mazomanie, published a brochure and map of the new Black Hawk Auto Touring Route. Funded by the Wisconsin Sesquicentennial Commission, along with corporate sponsors including AT&amp;T, SC Johnson Wax, and The Credit Union of Wisconsin, fifteen new historical markers, \u201cwhich describe tragic events for native peoples and the war\u2019s pivotal significance in Wisconsin history,\u201d were installed along the route, bringing the total to thirty five.\u201cAuto Touring Route, 1832 Black Hawk War,\u201d Wisconsin Historical Society, 1998. The Auto Touring Route was broken into three convenient segments, the East Segment (163 miles; 4 hours), West Segment (271 miles; 7 hour), and South Segment (91 miles; 3 hours). In addition to detailed itineraries for each of the three segments, the brochure included an inset reminding travelers to \u201cPlan Your Trip\u201d \u201cAlthough the actual war trail is about 250 miles long, the auto tour route covers over 500 miles, so it\u2019s important to plan your journey to avoid doing too much in one day. The map will guide your way. Imagine many of Black Hawk\u2019s tribe walked most of the way!\u201d\u201cThe Black Hawk Trail,\u201d Vernon County Historical Society, http://www.vernoncountyhistory.org/blackhawk/black_hawk.php The Auto Touring Route in Wisconsin is just one of a handful of Black Hawk trails, including a second one in Wisconsin that was created in 1930 by Charles Porter, a doctor, dairyman, and local historian. Actually the trail in Vernon County is called \u201cThe End of the Trail,\u201d and it describes Black Hawk as \u201ca prominent war leader who led his followers to disaster in 1832.\u201d33 There is also a Black Hawk Trail in eastern Iowa, near Saukenuk. Sponsored by the Davenport Auto Club and established in 1916, the trail was a 35-mile route that started and ended in Davenport. According to the Iowa Department of Transportation, \u201cIt is assumed that the auto trail was named in honor of the area\u2019s connection to Chief Black Hawk and the Black Hawk War of 1832. In fact, the auto route may have been part of the trail the Sauk and Fox Indians traveled by foot between Iowa and Illinois.\u201d\u201cHistoric Auto Trails,\u201d Iowa DOT, https://iowadot.gov/autotrails/blackhawktrail There\u2019s even a Black Hawk Horse Trail in northeastern Kansas that follows the shoreline of Pomona Reservoir. And Black Hawk appears elsewhere in Kansas, too. A cluster of historical markers can be found in Highland, Kansas, a small town just south of Iowa Point. In addition to ones about the Oregon-California Trail, the Missionary Movement, and the Iowa, Sac and Fox Mission, which operated from 1837-1868, one marker, entitled \u201cEmigrant Indians in Kansas,\u201d describes the forced removal of thousands of Native Americans to what is now the State of Kansas. \u201cAs the nation pushed west, Indian tribes were removed from their lands,\u201d it explains.\u201cEmigrant Indians,\u201d Kansas Historical Society, https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/emigrant-indians/15146 As noted in the \u201cKansan\u201d chapter, this particular marker also features an image of Black Hawk along with a caption indicating that the leader \u201cdied in Iowa prior to the Sac &amp; Fox relocation to Kansas.\u201d The specific relocation referenced on the sign occurred five years after the Black Hawk War officially ended. Today, the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska, one of three federally recognized tribes of Sauk and Fox people, is based in northeastern Kansas near the Great Nemaha River, where they were relocated after signing the Treaty of 1837. Forced removal via federal policy is one example of how the land has been shaped, scoured, and scarred by settler colonization, including narratives of settlement. It has also been physically transformed by glaciers and narratives of glaciation. According to the Kansas Historical Society, \u201cPeople have lived on this land for thousands of years. The earliest evidence is people who migrated from the north when glaciers pushed them to the south.\u201d\u201cKansas,\u201d Kansas Historical Society, https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/kansas/17702 This is an example of forced removal via the Ice Age. The 2014 Kansas Byways Interpretive Plan, discussed in the \u201cKansan\u201d chapter, outlines a series of storylines or themes for interpretive materials and signage. One of the themes, \u201cFirst People, First Nations,\u201d offers a twist on the now familiar conjunction of glacial and settler origin stories: \u201cPeople have inhabited Kansas since the end of the Ice Age, over 11,000 years ago.\u201d This move, which uses glaciers to transform First People into First Settlers, sets up the next move, which operates through the \u201cImmigrants All\u201d theme. This insidious storyline is \u201cabout the people who came and settled in Kansas. This storyline includes the stories of not only Euro-American pioneers but of those Indian tribes that were forced to come here and may (such as the Sac &amp; Fox) or may not (such as the Quapaw) have settled. There is no native Kansan. All are immigrants, even the Indians who came to this land over 11,000 years ago.\u201d\u201cKansas Byways Interpretive Plan,\u201d Fermata Inc. (2014), 20, http://www.fermatainc.com/?page_id=2883 This is Glacial Manifest Destiny. And this is an all too common strategy for seizing Indigeneity and Indigenous land. A headline in the La Crosse Tribune on July 4, 1976\u2014the bicentennial of the United States\u2014read: \u201cThey Were The First: Even the Winnebago Were Immigrants!\u201d From the Black Hawk trails we can see examples of forced removal via federal policy, forced removal via glaciers, and also forced removal via contemporary climate chaos. Kyle Powys Whyte argues that Indigenous peoples in North America \u201care already living in what our ancestors would have understood as dystopian or post-apocalyptic times.\u201dKyle Powys Whyte, \u201cWhite Allies, Let\u2019s Be Honest About Decolonization,\u201d Yes! Magazine (April 3, 2018), http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/decolonize/white-allies-lets-be-honest-about-decolonization-20180403 \u201cClimate injustice, for Indigenous peoples,\u201d he suggests, \u201cis less about the specter of a new future and more like the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d specifically \u201ccolonial d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201dKyle Powys Whyte, \u201cIs it Colonial D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Indigenous Peoples and Climate Injustice,\u201d in Humanities for the Environment: Integrating Knowledge, Forging New Constellations of Practice, edited by Joni Adamson and Michel Davis, London: Routledge, 2016, 88. Whyte also points to future climate projections that show Oklahoma, as defined by average summer temperature, will migrate to Michigan by the end of the century, if not before. The irony of migrating climates is not lost on Whyte, an enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, whose people were forcibly removed from Indiana and Michigan to Kansas and Oklahoma in 1838, in what became known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death. Whyte jokes, \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the United States is trying to put every Native Nation into Oklahoma, or at least Anishinaabe people, by bringing Oklahoma to the Great Lakes.\u201dKyle Powys Whyte, \u201cIndigenous Peoples and Climate Justice,\u201d Bedrock Lectures (April 18, 2018), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPvsOCUhI8; George W.

But here the intersection is more oblique. Just outside of town, on the shoulder of Highway 14, a historical marker commemorates the discovery of an American Mastodon skeleton in 1897. The \u201cBoaz Mastodon,\u201d as it has come to be known, was found by farmers \u201csticking out of an eroded bank on a tributary of Mill Creek\u201d after a severe rainstorm. It was the first recorded discovery of mastodon bones in Wisconsin. Mastodons, the marker explains, \u201chad moved into Wisconsin after the last glacial retreat about 13,000 years ago and lived here for the next 4,000 years, when they became extinct. A fluted quartzite spear point found near the bones suggests that humans also arrived in Wisconsin shortly after the glacial retreat and may have hunted these animals for food.\u201d Since 1915, the skeleton has been prominently displayed at the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum. \u201cOur mastodon is our museum\u2019s most iconic fossil and it\u2019s arguably one of the most famous fossils in Wisconsin,\u201d said museum curator Carrie Eaton. \u201cIt is the centerpiece of our skeleton room.\u201dSeth Jovaag, \u201cGeologists Rewrite The Story Of Wisconsin\u2019s Boaz Mastodon,\u201d Wisconsin Life (October 28, 2015), https://www.wisconsinlife.org/story/geologists-rewrite-the-story-of-wisconsins-boaz-mastodon/ It\u2019s unclear what has become of the fluted quartzite spear point, but the passing reference to it\u2014along with a second, slightly less thrilling historical marker in Boaz Community Park\u2014connects glacial and settler origin stories.",

Following nearby Mill Creek, some of the band headed over these rugged hills known as the Ocooch Mountains. Along the way, many Indians died from exhaustion, starvation and battle wounds.\u201d The Ocooch Mountains are not familiar landmarks today. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, \u201cOcooch is an obsolete name for the highlands in south-western Wisconsin.\u201dWisconsin Historical Society, \u201cOcooch Mountains,\u201d https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS11308 More widespread in the 1970s, Ocooch was the predecessor to the Driftless Area as the name for the Western Uplands or unglaciated landscape. The Ocooch Mountain News, for instance, was published in the tiny town of Gillingham, Wisconsin from 1974 to 1981. In The Driftless Reader, editors Curt Meine and Keefe Keeley describe the Driftless as \u201ca geological term that is coming to define an emerging bioregional identity.\u201dCurt Meine and Keefe Keeley, editors, The Driftless Reader, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2017, xxviii. In contrast, Ocooch is assumed to be an \u201cIndian word\u201d by most settlers. Its meanings and origins, however, are unclear. Or rather there are conflicting interpretations. In many settler accounts, the Ocooch Mountains refer to \u201ca small band of Indians called the Ocoche who once made these hills [between Spring Green and Viroqua] home.\u201d In these accounts, the word is often translated as \u201cwaters with many fish.\u201d\u201cKickapoo River Valley,\u201d Driftless Wisconsin, Inc., https://driftlesswisconsin.com/explore/kickapoo-river-valley/; \u201cOcooch Mountains,\u201d The Historical Marker Database, https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=43534 As you know from the \u201cIoway\u201d chapter, Lance Foster has a different interpretation: \u201cThe word Ocooch is Siouan, either Winnebago or Ioway. It is not Algonquian, not Kickapoo.\u201d Although he translates Ocooch to \u201cThe Mountains of the Snowy Lodges\u201d or \u201cdirectly in Ioway as Snowy-Lodge Mountains, Pahkochee Ahaymahshee,\u201d Foster also indicates that there is not a direct translation, and that there are multiple meanings of the word.Lance M. Foster, \u201cMountains of Snowy Lodges &#8211; A Wisconsin Memory\u201d (2013), http://ioway.nativeweb.org/history/mountains_of_snowy_lodges.htm The Wisconsin Historical Society counters: \u201cAlthough the Ho-Chunk and Iowa languages contain phonetic equivalents for the sound \u2018Ocooch,\u2019 there is no clear evidence that the name entered English from either of those indigenous languages.\u201dWisconsin Historical Society, \u201cOcooch Mountains.\u201d What constitutes clear evidence in this case? And how is geology mobilized to authorize certain ways of knowing? Turning to the origins of Meskonsing and marshaling geology, the Historical Society confidently declares, \u201cOur state\u2019s name, supported by geological evidence, means \u2018river running through a red place.\u2019\u201d\u201cWisconsin\u2019s Name: Where it Came From and What it Means,\u201d Wisconsin Historical Society, https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS3663 Ocooch is another (bio)regional imaginary, similar in some ways to the \u201cMiddle Ground,\u201d \u201cHeartland,\u201d and \u201cDriftless.\u201d But Ocooch differs significantly in its groundings, orientations, and meanings. As another conceptual apparatus, Ocooch reveals something important about how the Driftless has been produced as a counterregion\u2014a response to Indigenous land, dynamic \u201cmodes of relationship,\u201d and \u201ccollective continuance\u201d\u2014partly through converging stories of glaciation and settlement. In this way, Ocooch undermines the conditions that it names more vigorously than Meskonsing-Kansan. Ocooch also keeps space \u201cpolitically open,\u201d and avoids \u201ca false antagonism that centers and further entrenches the settler imaginary by deflecting attention from foundational tensions between Indigenous peoples and settlers.\u201dNicholas Brown, \u201cExperiments in Regional Settler-Colonization: Pursuing Justice and Producing Scale through the Montana Study,\u201d in Settler City Limits: Indigenous Resurgence and Colonial Violence in the Urban Prairie West, edited by Heather Dorries, Robert Henry, David Hugill, Tyler McCreary, and Julie Tomiak, Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press, 2019, 135. In a conciliatory essay, \u201cThe View from Man Mound,\u201d Curt Meine suggests that from the man-shaped effigy mound in Sauk County, \u201cwe can look out and see that the history of Wisconsin\u2019s natural and human communities is woven together on Wisconsin\u2019s landscape.\u201d \u201cFrom Man Mound,\u201d he continues, \u201cwe can see ecological change over not just one but multiple temporal thresholds.\u201d Meine concludes by reflecting on contemporary Indigenous/settler relationships to each other and the land. \u201cAt Man Mound,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe geographies of the ancient Native Americans and recently arrived Euro-Americans intersected. At their point of intersection, damage was done. At that same point of intersection, a healing was also begun.\u201dMeine, \u201cThe View from Man Mound,\u201d 18, 24, 28. The views from the Ocooch Mountains are different. Fresh wounds from ongoing violence are visible. The possibility that healing is not the same as reconciling can also be discerned. And the healing work that is happening, which isn\u2019t always perceptible, is not just or even primarily between Native Americans and Euro-Americans, but between Indigenous peoples like the Ho-Chunk, Iowa, and Kickapoo, who are reclaiming Indigenous spaces and modes of relationship in spite of \u201cus.\u201d",

As part of the Field Guides to the Anthropocene Drift series, this essay introduces Indigenous land and the (colonial) Anthropocene in the territory between what are known today as the Wisconsin and Kansas rivers and the Wisconsinan and Kansan glaciations.

                "text": "Meskonsing-Kansan is about place, or at least a way of thinking about places, regions, and counterterritories. Meskonsing-Kansan is delineated by glacial limits\u2014the limits of the so-called Kansan and late Wisconsinan glaciations\u2014separated by more than 500 miles and 500,000 years. Meskonsing-Kansan is articulated through a series of treaties, broken and unhonored except for the land cessions. In the wake of the 1832 Black Hawk War, the Ho-Chunk, for example, suffered multiple removals\u2014from Wisconsin to Iowa, to Minnesota, to Dakota Territory, and then to Nebraska. If it can be defined by tracing Indigenous removals and land cessions, Meskonsing-Kansan can also be understood in terms of refusals and returns, particularly among the Ho-Chunk, Meskwaki, Iowa, and Kickapoo Nations. The effects of removals are felt today and every day, and shape what Nick Estes calls \u201cthe Indigenous political practice of return, restoration, and reclamation of belonging and place.\u201dNick Estes, Our History Is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance, New York: Verso, 2019, 248. Meskonsing-Kansan is composed of hundreds of watersheds above the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers near present-day St. Louis and historic Cahokia. It can be traversed by following these ribbons of water not from source to sea, but from source to source\u2014from the headwaters of the Delaware River, for example, to the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, and then up the Mississippi River to the Wisconsin River, and finally to the headwaters of the Kickapoo River. Glacial narratives, like glacial erratics, dot the contemporary landscape. Meskonsing-Kansan is shaped and storied by a Glacial Manifest Destiny that pushes preordination, like a stone, back in time\u2014beyond time immemorial into the vast expanse of geologic time or settler deep time. Despite the physical and symbolic violence enacted by these glacial narratives, they are precarious. They have failed to erase other stories\u2014other ways of thinking with the land\u2014and failed to persuade us of their own inevitability. Meskonsing-Kansan makes visible the (colonial) Anthropocene, which is to say it reveals how ongoing processes of colonization are transforming the earth. The (colonial) Anthropocene is everywhere, of course, but it is palpable in places like Iowa Point, Kansas, and Indian Lake, Wisconsin.",

The 2 x 2-meter hedge modules on wheels were pushed around on the square to create shade from the sun and to make human-scale intimate spaces in which to relax, enjoy the company of others, to take a snack or just rest. The Mobile Hedges art intervention aimed at making the \u2018life between buildings\u2019 a more liveable space for people, to reference influential Danish architect Jan Gehl\u2019s book title:\u00a0Life Between Buildings (1971); and acted at the same time as a criticism to Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s lack of consideration for people in his public architecture while at the same time introducing a solution, however temporary and experimental.",

Hedges are placed around most people&#8217;s land to mark their property and create privacy.

        "abstract": "In September 2019, a group of travelers boarded a set of canoes and set off from the Mississippi River\u2019s headwaters in Lake Itasca, embarking on a hundred-day journey down the river\u2019s length: the Anthropocene River Journey, in which twenty-five scholars, artists, and activists along with students from River Semester of Augsburg University in Minneapolis, Minnesota participated. In this essay, Joe Underhill, who organizes the River Semester at Augsburg University, recounts the many experiences the travelers underwent on both land and water, relating them to the ideas and practices of what might constitute an \u201cAnthropocene curriculum.\u201d Confrontations with the often destructive social, economic, and political realities of those who live along the river offered a stark contrast with the more joyful, even spiritual experiences of life in the field. Critically reflecting upon this experiment in immersive, field-based education, Underhill and fellow travelers offer an exploration of the (dis)comforts of an approach that they suggest could be called \u201cbeing at home-in-the-world.\u201d",

                "text": "This essay explores the idea of an Anthropocene curriculum that connects students directly to the world through immersive, field-based education while practicing a form of low-carbon, sustainable living. These life-affirming and meaningful experiences are much needed in the midst of the generally grim realities of the present era, made all the more daunting now by COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, this is an exploration of the (dis)comforts of what could be called being at home-in-the-world. This is both a radical rethinking of the praxis of higher education and a pedagogical form that allows for a nuanced, balanced, and complex understanding of the Anthropocene. This notion is explored via the example of the River Semester, a hundred-day canoe journey down the Mississippi River in 2015 and 2018 (with the next trip planned for 2021). A custom form of this expedition, organized in partnership with the Haus der Kulturen der Welt and Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, took place in Fall 2019 under the title of the \u201cAnthropocene River Journey.\u201d These programs were conceived as lived experiments and performative acts of rebellion against existing practices in higher education and as correctives for the resource-intensive norms of modern Western consumer capitalism. An Anthropocene curriculum needs to provide opportunities for the life-affirming communal experiences and connections with what remains \u201cnatural\u201d in the Anthropocene. We have found these experiences to provide students with the skills and mindset needed for the long journey ahead and to be powerful medicine for the anxieties, anomie, and dysfunctions of our day. Introduction In these precarious times\u2014variously referred to as the Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Chthulucene, climate change, the Great Acceleration\u2014those attuned to the realities of the global dynamics and trends, and called to respond to them, face a daunting set of challenges, stresses, and psychological strains. Maintaining hope, a sense of purpose, health, and sanity in the midst of the Sixth Extinction, rising sea levels, catastrophic floods and fires, resurgent xenophobic populist nationalism, and global pandemics is no small feat. Teaching and learning in this context require a curriculum that engages with these difficult and complex realities and also an intentionality around the ways to inspire hope and the sense of agency needed for the work that will inevitably be required to navigate the (literal and metaphorical) storms that lie ahead. As Alya Ansari, one of the participants in planning workshops for the Anthropocene River project, puts it: The Anthropocene has raised more questions and uncertainty about the ways in which we live and know than it has delineated a clear, forward course of action. What does it mean, concretely, to do the kind of comprehensive reformation of knowledge production that the Anthropocene calls for and enables? How do we resist within the Anthropocene, and how do we use the agency the concept bestows upon us to grapple with the harsh realities of a world we have created? These canoe-based, semester-long expeditions down the Mississippi River, by their very nature, entail a thorough exposure to and immersion in the social, political, and anthropocenic realities of life in the American heartland. Stripped of the protections and comforts of life indoors and away from the screen-dominated (ir)realities of the digital age, the travelers on these journeys come face to face with the industry, poverty, wealth, wilderness, pollution, beauty, injustices, vitality, and dysfunction of natural and human communities all along the river.Joseph Underhill, \u201cWhat We Learned from the River,\u201d Open Rivers, no. 6 (Spring 2017): https://editions.lib.umn.edu/openrivers/article/what-we-learned-from-the-river/ The students on these trips face the rigors of paddling hundreds of miles on a major river in all kinds of weather and attend to the duties and needs of the expedition, all while taking a full load of college credits. In a significant expansion of the usual programming, the 2019 Anthropocene River project, involved close to 500 scholars, activists, artists, and community organizers in a complex, multifaceted investigation of the Mississippi River as part of the hyperobject of the Anthropocene.Timothy Morton, The Ecological Thought. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2010; Matt Edgeworth and Jeffrey Benjamin, \u201cWhat Is a River? The Chicago River as Hyperobject.\u201d in Rivers of the Anthropocene, ed. Jason M. Kelley et. al. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2018, pp. 162\u201375. The Anthropocene River project has produced (and continues to produce) a rich body of research, in various forms. As one early attempt to collate and reflect on at least some portion of this multimedia \u201craw data,\u201d this essay draws on the resulting mix of field notes, art and research projects, and short contributions, as well as the experiences of the 2019 and earlier River Journeys. Photo documentation and field notes are inserted as illustrations of points raised in the text, and also as standalone vignettes that capture moments and sites that stood out for the river travelers. One of the most notable elements of these journeys is that they are much more than the standard educational endeavors of research and knowledge acquisition. At many points along the way, participants have broken down and wept. This journey through the Anthropocene is emotionally laden and requires us to move from the cerebral and more narrowly academic concerns to our hearts and bodies and to notions of self-care, health, joy, and thriving. A central question raised by the experience of an extended, mostly human-powered voyage through an anthropocenic space is what the sustainability of those efforts is, in personal and emotional terms. In other words, how can we live and find joy in the midst of such immersion in the challenges and stresses of the Anthropocene?",

As one recent report outlines: From 2016 to 2017, the number of adults who described themselves as more anxious than the previous year rose 36 percent. In 2017, more than 17 million American adults had a new diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, as well as three million adolescents ages 12 to 17. Forty million adults now suffer from an anxiety disorder\u2014nearly 20 percent of the adult population. \u2026 [Among] all Americans, the suicide rate increased by 33 percent between 1999 and 2017.The report is by the American Psychiatric Association, described in Lee Siegel, \u201cWhy is America so Depressed?\u201d New York Times, Jan 2, 2020. Much will be asked of us in the years ahead, and in ways it will always be more than we are capable of. We already are and will always fall short, witnessing\u2014as we currently are\u2014destruction, deaths, extinctions, and injustices on a daily basis. This question of how to live in the Anthropocene entails the double project of finding that balance that allows us to do what we can without becoming exhausted, while also having the time and space to respond (mourn the losses, celebrate the partial victories) that will inevitably ensue.Donna Haraway, \u201cAnthropocene, Capitalocene, Plantationocene, Chthulucene: Making Kin,\u201d Environmental Humanities, vol. 6 (2015) pp. 159\u201365; Anna Tsing, The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibilities of Life in the Capitalist Ruins. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017; Robin Wall Kimmerer, Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants. Minneapolis: Milkweed, 2015.This amounts to finding a home in the midst of all this chaos\u2014a place of refuge, a sense of belonging and community, a connection to place, and a space within which we can thrive and be creative. We might call such a space a home-in-the-world. It is a way of living in the Anthropocene that allows us to engage with the realities and challenges of our day, minimize our environmental impact, and maintain a sense of agency. Each person experienced the journey differently. During these various river journeys, many participants at times did feel overwhelmed, anxious, frightened, or ready to call it quits. But at many points during our river journeys, we also felt decidedly at home on the river. We experienced joy there\u2014living simply, with far less of the material possessions that separate us from the world, slowing down, using our bodies to do the daily paddling and setting up camp, sitting around the fire, to swim in the water, to experience a sense of reverential belonging, of grace. One such moment happened as we paddled through a thick swath of wild rice, when two Ojibwe rice-harvesting canoes silently emerged, quietly pushed along by men with long poles. There was a brief greeting, then a return back into the rice marsh, the boats swallowed up and disappearing into the tall grass. This display of connection and harmonious relationship with the land was inspiring, and reflected a certain hunger for that kind of connection among our group of river travelers. A central element to the notion of home-in-the-world is the spiritual and ritual or ceremonial aspects of that space. Under the vastness of the sky and immersed in the unknowable mysteries and deeply troubling realities of the world, the river travelers instinctively moved toward\u2014hungered for\u2014the comfort afforded by ritual and ceremony. This longing for a sense of connection and meaning affirmed the importance of the journey as a pilgrimage, not toward the otherworldly redemption of a Christian heaven but toward deeper connections to the world, to each other, and to the sublime. In all this, the mysterium mysteriorum was the gigantic, majestic, magical entity of the Mississippi River itself. Each time we returned to the river, it was, as in the words of the traditional spiritual, like we were \u201cgoing down in the river to pray.\u201d Each time we swam in its waters, we were being baptized. The river at various times healed us, frightened us, washed away our sweat and our sins, and steadily carried us along toward the sea. In the midst of the relentless reminders of the damage wrought by the capital-industrial-military complex, the palpable constant of the river\u2019s flow was calming. Despite all efforts to control it, to use it as a sewer and a dumping ground or a highway, the river has not been stopped or killed. It remains a force greater than us that came before and will be here after. We took some comfort in that fact.",

Other people and creatures are carefully excluded, their movement controlled by walls, doors, screens, glass, and locks. This sense of home is tied to place as private property. Being at home-in-the-world, on the other hand, requires leaving the confines and controlled environments of the technological home and setting out into unfamiliar and largely uncontrolled terrain. It entails risk, exposure to the elements, improvisation, and flexibility\u2014what anthropologist Anna Tsing refers to as \u201cengagement with precarity.\u201dTsing, The Mushroom at the End of the World.On the river, we travel a meandering path, which requires the exercise of what the ancient Greeks referred to as m\u00eatis, or the improvisational skills needed to problem solve in the field. That is, we have to adapt to conditions, ask around, move camp, find shelter, live with some bugs, put on sunscreen, don a raincoat. This kind of outdoor living entail some exposure to the pollution, poverty, anomie, and floods that constitute a large part of our contemporary reality, without rendering oneself too uncomfortable or in danger. The next section of this essay recounts our attempt at finding such a home-in-the-world, using a handful of scenarios from our journeys on the river to illustrate a few aspects of the Anthropocene curriculum. Following this, it turns to a description of the kind of curriculum called for by these times, looking at the psychological dimensions of this experience and exploring the physical and energetic limits and ways to navigate the emotional terrain of the Anthropocene.

The odyssey constitutes a kind of \u201cpilgrim\u2019s progress\u201d through the Anthropocene, with hints of a way forward\u2014not out of the Anthropocene but into a way of finding a home within it. At points along the way, the journeys have included encounters and conversations with river elders and other local guides who have provided insights that hint at what came before, what has been lost, and what might yet be possible again. Most of the river and watershed are heavily industrialized and engineered, but scattered throughout the journeys are also signs of resilience, agency, and hope. Being out on the river can often be discouraging. But it can also provide evidence of the strength and vitality of the river, and of the natural world in general. In spending an extended period of time on the Mississippi, we are reminded of the basic truth that the world is always more complicated than it is made out to be in any given abstract representation of it. Although the dynamics and processes of the Anthropocene seem to engulf us, the colonization of the river is not complete. There are guides and mentors along the way\u2014Indigenous voices, women artist-activists, river angels, river rats\u2014who offer wisdom and perspective on our journey through the mixed dystopic, pastoral, and thoroughly anthropocenic landscape. At the beginning of our journey as part of the Anthropocene Curriculum, for instance, we met with Shanai Matteson and Graci Horne, who helped to orient us to the headwaters and Indigenous history of the Upper Mississippi. Horne, a Lakota/Dakota artist-activist, shared with us four questions used in her community to introduce oneself to a group: Who am I? Where am I? Who are my people? and What are my intentions? Her challenge to us was to critically reflect on our presence and roles within this settler-colonial space. Simple as they were, these questions challenged us and stayed with us throughout the journey, helping to ground us in place and in community with each other and with the people we met along the way. She likewise spoke of the river as a \u201cTree of Life\u201d in the middle of Turtle Island (the Indigenous name for the North American Continent), and our group would come to see the river and watershed as a source of life force and spiritual sustenance along the journey. Horne invited us to think about those Indigenous lives that were lost, and continue to be lost, on and along the river, and to give tobacco in offering to them as we went (which we did on a few occasions). The challenge presented to us at the start of our journey was how to acknowledge and constructively engage with this history as a group of mostly white, affluent academics.",

To help bring about the historically unprecedented economic and social transformations called for by these challenges, we will need something more than a curriculum that is embedded within the modern fossil-fuel-powered economy, rooted in medieval scholasticism, and structured by the narrow and atomistic structures and epistemologies of modernity. But the River Semester is one attempt at imaging such an alternative. The Anthropocene is bringing about the collapse of conceptual and disciplinary boundaries, connecting the local and global via the technosphere, eliding nature and culture, and entangling us in \u201cclashing temporalities.\u201d Our experiences on the river reflected these complexities and entanglements. We were neither in the wilderness nor in \u201ccivilization,\u201d but in a thorough mix of the two, experiencing always a balance between the harm caused by humans, and, at the same time, the strength and vitality of the riverine ecosystems. The hybrid and liminal nature of the Anthropocene requires an increased competence in intercultural diversity and interdisciplinary thinking, as well as practical training that moves beyond the theoretical confines of the academy. The program offers action-oriented education that is localized and applied to problem-solving, resilience, and coping skills for operating in stressful, even traumatic, situations. The river journeys provide an array of opportunities to engage in this kind of learning and provides hints of what a curriculum fit for the Anthropocene might look like. These times call for ways of teaching, learning, and doing research (and living) that are commensurate with the scope of the societal transformations being wrought by the Anthropocene\u2014that is to say, what is needed is an education for systems change, not an education for learning how to function or thrive within the existing system.",

These forms of human alteration stand in contrast to the unstoppable flow of the river and the ongoing battle between the transportation and industrial infrastructures (constructed primarily by the US Army Corps of Engineers) and the natural hydrology of the Mississippi. The dredge piles were the work both of the river (constantly transporting and depositing sediment along its path) and the engineer corps, endlessly scooping sediment out of the river in a Sisyphean attempt to maintain the nine-foot navigational channel of the Upper Mississippi.",

Much of the history of modern, Western, settler-colonial capitalism can be read as the quest for greater levels of control over the world (controlling othered bodies, water, energy, food production, and capital, keeping out disease, enemy invaders, \u201cundesirable people,\u201d and so on). This system has gotten very good at creating a sense of control over its surroundings. The results are planetary dysfunction, climate change, extinctions, and personal dysfunction, depression, anxiety, and malaise. To a large degree, these systems are mirrored, replicated, and refined within the structures of higher education. One goal of an Anthropocene curriculum is to \u201cget outside\u201d of these structures and resource-intensive ways of being. To a degree, this means living with fewer barriers between us and the world. Such an arrangement facilitates our own awareness of and understanding of the Anthropocene in all its unpleasantness. By removing these barriers, we are brought into conversation and cohabitation with the amazing array of humans and species\u2014kin\u2014that share this planet, and, in the process, we become more fully alive. This does not mean we should or can remove all barriers\u2014the complete removal of barriers is found only in death and our complete dissolution into the world. Human life requires us to be reasonably warm (or cool) and to avoid the mosquito bites, sunburn, poison ivy rashes, and other unpleasantries that can come from life out of doors. The trick is to find that the balance between being connected to the world and being exposed to danger or great discomfort. There are always trade-offs here, but it seems clear that a large part of the Anthropocene problematic is the excess of barriers. An Anthropocene curriculum, then, requires some redefining of the \u201ccomforts of home,\u201d not as the sterile isolation of the modern home but as the vitality and connection found in being at home-in-the-world. To the extent that our ecological (and often social) impacts are directly tied to our comfort level, this new way of living will require giving up things, and living with less control and comfort than we have become accustomed to. Some technological fixes\u2014solar energy, electric cars, high-efficiency buildings, and so on\u2014may allow us to have our cake and eat it too. But, at least in the short term, there is no way we can reduce the total destructive impacts of the modern economy and way of life without some fairly radical shifts. We should not underestimate the political, social, and cultural difficulties of such a shift\u2014humans are generally attached to their comforts, love labor-saving devices and new gadgets, and there is a massive marketing system promoting all of this. The question of how much we can or should we give up came up at various points along the river trips, as we collectively faced the physical challenges and discomforts of a life that entailed a significant decrease in the control and conveniences of home-in-the-Capitalocene. For the most part, we used our own bodies for labor, with the result being a per-person carbon footprint that was a small fraction of a typical American\u2019s. We were sheltered from the elements by a few layers of clothing or our sleeping bags and the two thin layers of ripstop nylon that constituted our tents at night. We got muddy, bathed in the river, were bitten by various blood-sucking insects, and experienced at various times sunburn, straight-line winds, scattered flurries, and flash floods. As we as individuals struggled with these conditions, we had to think about how much discomfort we were willing and able to endure. Undertaking the River Journey is not a matter of doing penance for our extractive and overconsumptive sins (although there is inevitably an element of the morality play here). Such an experience is most constructively seen as engaging in an awareness of the true \u201ccost of living,\u201d as it includes a wide array of social and environmental impacts. It is then our responsibility to minimize these impacts and in a basic sense just clean up our messes. It is important to keep in mind that this kind of low-impact living should not be imposed on those living at the margins\u2014people for whom the exposure to the vagaries of the world is a daily reality, often with high costs. The global poor, seeking relief from the hardships of poverty, have every right to improve their standards of living and enjoy the benefits of \u201cmodern life.\u201d Those in the Global South and Indigenous and other marginalized communities within Western nations will need to find their own paths, with allyship consisting largely of the hegemonic rich white folks getting out of their way, addressing the historical injustices, and dismantling the structures that continue to do slow violence in those communities.Rob Nixon, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press 2013. The issue here is not to impose strictures on the poor; it is crucial that there is agency and choice in this process of making a home-in-the-world, not some imposed hardship of poverty or displacement. But for those who can and do choose to live at home-in-the-world, it then becomes possible to see value, joy, and a way forward through this kind of liminal, balanced way of life, walking as lightly as we can on the Earth, transitioning as quickly as we can away from the fossil-fueled economic system, and in the process undoing some of the psychological harm inflicted by civilization\u2019s discontents.This approach shares some of cultural theorist Donna Haraway\u2019s characterization of the current era as the \u201cChthulucene,\u201d in which we are thoroughly and unavoidably interconnected with all life forms and in which we seek kinship with our fellow species. How hard do we push ourselves in order to address these societal transformations that the Anthropocene now requires of us? There is no one particular answer to this question, other than to say that we must cultivate an awareness of the issues and engage in an ongoing discernment of how far to push ourselves. The appropriate balance will depend on the individuals that make up a given community, and the cultural context. For our particular experience of facing the Anthropocene on the River Journey, besides the challenge of safely navigating the actual river (an inherently dangerous activity, in and of itself), we needed to travel through this landscape with a level of self-awareness about all the above-described emotional dynamics. A key dimension to the experience is the attitude and group culture with which it is approached. If the attitude is one of unrelenting pessimism and despair, the experience reflects this. Approached with some level of optimism or hope for change, the experience is markedly different. In the context of spending time on, and learning from, rivers, this optimistic approach amounts to aspiring toward something akin to the state of flowSee, inter alia, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. New York: Harper, 2008. or being-in-the-river, in the sense of being fully immersed in the complex and multifaceted realities of life, rather than being separated from them. On these river expeditions, such a state of flow is often the case, both literally and figuratively. Finding the balance between stagnation and exhaustion, between those things that we cannot change and those that we can, between boredom and terror, we sought a kind of Aristotelian golden mean. Not unlike the current negotiations around safe spaces and trauma on campuses and in classrooms, we need to find the right amount of challenge\u2014that is to say, a right balance to challenge our ideas and assumptions but not cause harm or trauma. In expedition language, we must try to find that space known as one\u2019s \u201cchallenge zone,\u201d which exists between the comfort zone and the panic zone. An embodied theory of education and life calls us to get our neurons firing, our muscles pumping, our senses alive. This idea of being \u201cfully alive\u201d is worth taking seriously, even as it ironically entails being closer to death\u2014more exposed, vulnerable, at risk in the world. If the Faustian bargain of modern consumer-extractive capitalism is that we have numbed and anesthetized ourselves, retreated to the mall and self-hypnotized ourselves in front of the digital phantasmagoria of a billion high-def screens, this journey into home-in-the-world offers an alternative where we can connect with the world and our fellow human beings, with a much greater chance of saving ourselves. This kind of \u201caliveness\u201d includes a thorough connection with and awareness of the beauty and wonder of the world, a connection to a community, a grounding in the body and the pleasures and joys that it brings\u2014and a sense of purpose and meaning in one\u2019s life. We experienced all these dimensions, at various points and to varying degrees, along the river. Imagining a way home Can you imagine a way Canoe, to carry us home?

The landscape\u2019s palette is bleak and dark and raises again the question of how to move through this space and to live with these grim realities while still maintaining one\u2019s sanity, agency, and any sense of hope. Any number of different responses to these kinds of modern stresses can arise\u2014escapism and retreat, religion, drug use, therapy, action, humor, getting lost in abstraction. Which mix of these is most conducive to making some progress in addressing the Anthropocene problematic, particularly in regard to a university curriculum? These anthropocenic states of mind\u2014ranging from anger to dysthymia to depression to trauma\u2014were ameliorated through the kinds of experiences we had on the river. Because, in addition to all the \u201cfuckery\u201d perpetrated by the forces of reactionary patriarchal heteronormative fossil-fueled consumer capitalist neocolonialism, there is also a great deal of life force, fierce love, and diverse resilience out there. There is the unending flow of energy from the sun, the never-ending flow of rain from the skies, the inventiveness and ongoing diversity of life forms and genetic material, and the richness of cultures that we will need in order to imagine a way home. The world has been harmed, but it is still a huge world. Humans, despite our increasing numbers and impact, are still but a small part of the whole. On these journeys it was clear that the river was bigger than us. And it provided us with many moments of solace, inspiration, and joy.",

Having succeeded in safely rounding the wing dam, we made our way, with tired limbs, to the landing on a wide expanse of sandy beach.

There our generous hosts brought us pralines, cokes, beer, and stories, showed us the gators in the nearby slough, and invited us back to their houses for showers and stories of life in the shadows of the sugar fields and petrochemical factories.",

Amnesty International reports that Shell\u2019s claims that these spills occur from oil theft are unfounded. Other news outlets report that in 2014 youth in Ikarama began sabotaging the pipe that runs through their communities. Filling one\u2019s own community with the terror of toxins becomes a weapon for the weak in the Anthropocene; as human crude runs the cities of the North along border fences drawn by imperialism. Spills form pockets of oil not crossable, like the fences that surround the compounds with names like Dallas, where Shell employees land and leave with helicopters. Hydroimperialism, and the draining and reclaiming of swamps for capital, the reworking of deltas and the specter of extraction, is one of the Anthropocene\u2019s stories. As Timothy Mitchell writes, the politics, economies, and social relations of our worlds are engineered through energy flows. Estuaries are nodes in networks of accumulation.Cf. Timothy Mitchell, Carbon Democracy: Political Power in the Age of Oil. London: Verso, 2011. The pine in Ikarama becomes a boon along the Gulf of Mexico, a floating barrier on water to stop, control, and channel the BP oil spill. As reported by Eben Kirksey, Nicholas Shapiro, and Maria Brodine in The Multispecies Salon, Jacqueline Bishop, a New Orleans artist, began cleaning thousands of horseshoe crabs with a Q-tip, an unloved species ignored by rescue efforts. Despite the wall of her swamp boots, several layers of skin were eaten off the bottom of her feet, likely by Corexit, the oil dispersant BP sprayed in the Gulf. Pollutants move through fences and skin. She writes, \u201cSwabbing with the Q-tip was the same gesture as painting, except I was taking oil off instead of applying it.\u201dCf. Eben Kirksey, ed., The Multispecies Salon. Durham: Duke University Press, 2014. She sets down a shell, just like the father of the founder of Royal Dutch Shell oil, who first considered the potential of extraction in the Black Sea while on a shell collecting trip. The crab\u2019s shell is a resistance, a barrier, to being eaten by others.",

Why do we have them, where do they come from, and how have they played (an ever changing) part in shaping the world and our shifting understandings of it? So when it came to choosing an anthropogenic landscape, it was always going to be some form of collection, but rather than revisit the botanic gardens, herbaria, and databases where I usually spend my time, I thought I would venture into a space that lies outside the scope of my research at present, but in many ways functions in the same way. The Biological Museum in Stockholm, built in 1893, is designed rather like a traditional Norwegian church in what is now the Royal Djurg\u00e5rden Nature Reserve. Approaching the museum, one cannot miss the text that frames the ornately carved entrance: \u201cNordens Djurv\u00e4rld Sedd I Naturen\u201d (Nordic Fauna Seen in Nature). Enter, and nature awaits discovery. But what is this \u201cnature\u201d? I think the key word here is \u201cSeen.\u201d There is an important difference between the claim of presenting fauna seen in nature and fauna in nature, but in a science that privileges sight above the other senses, the difference can be overcome through the art of verisimilitude\u2014whether through the hands of the taxidermist and founder Gustaf Kolthoff, or of the painter Bruno Liljefors. The museum is similar to an observatory, where the animal kingdom is gathered, represented, and fixed in time and space. As such it functions as a microcosm, representing in this closed space all northern fauna. Unlike the cabinets used in most natural history museums, the specimens are mounted in a 360-degree diorama, so that the visitor has the experience of being immersed in the landscape. Like the bird-watcher, then, I will zoom in and begin with the small. This is a bullfinch, the harbinger of snow. At a glance, it looks alive, about to tilt its head before flitting off to another branch. It looks real. The taxidermist\u2019s art (re)captures the bullfinch in a possible moment, as in a photograph, so we can study its fine beak and beady eyes up close and at length. But we cannot observe its movements.",

It requires more of the observer\u2014a little imagination, a certain suspension of critical faculties, and a selective viewing, for instance, that the bullfinch is seen not through the kitchen window, but through the glass of panel 15. It is visibly locked. The padlock, marked with an egret, designates a clear boundary between \u201cnature out there\u201d (enclosed in the museum) and the observer. This is, of course, \u201cnature\u201d as conceived in 1893. It is completely devoid of human traces, with the exception of the remains of a wooden crate on the beach. On the ground floor, there is a small exhibition of bird species that have moved in and joined the Swedish fauna since the museum was built. An update, in effect. The sign emphasizes that (unlike the diorama, we might add) nature is not, in fact, static: \u201cOur fauna is in constant change. This might depend on human effects such as hunting, toxins, drainage of marsh lands, climate change etc. The changes can also be natural, as species expand to new territories. [. . .] Over time species disappear from Sweden while others immigrate and establish populations.\u201d Nonetheless, the dioramas are impressive technologies of representation. \u201cFauna Seen in Nature\u201d seems justified, if we accept that \u201cnature\u201d is that which can be captured, externalized, contained. In this museum-as-observatory, the human viewer is in the centre, surrounded by, yet separated from, a rendition of nature that is both controlled and fully knowable through the act of looking. At the same time, in a sense, it is the viewer who is encased, surrounded by dead species, whose glass eyes are no longer able to meet her gaze. There are two cabinets in the entrance: one with claustrophobic-looking bears, and another with the hare-grouse. It is a curiosity, yes, but in the context of genetic engineering debates, for instance, it seems prophetic of an anxiety about what the limits to controlling nature could or should be. At the heart of this observatory, this panopticon, is the emergency exit (\u201cEmergency exit only!\u201d in Swedish, English, and Russian), an elevator that makes me think of space shuttles and elaborate emergency-exit plans of planetary proportions. For me, this fixed, crafted landscape expresses the irony of a belief in the separateness of humans from the rest of the world coinciding with the age of the Anthropocene.",

Thirty years ago, when hundreds of acres of oak and hickory were slated for commercial timber harvest, Southern Illinois activists buried themselves up to their necks to block the roads. They went to court, over and over, until the tree removal was stopped. Today, these same local activists are hosting an international gathering to amplify the value of forests at a critical environmental juncture, as atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches above 400 parts per million. Diverse, thriving forests, which are one of the most powerful mitigators of atmospheric carbon, are increasingly threatened globally. Furthermore, under the Trump administration there have been draconian rollbacks to protections from air and water pollution, as well as numerous other challenges that bring the atmosphere closer to a tipping point. We\u2019re at an environmental education center near Carbondale, Illinois, and as the sun slips behind the trees, strategy sessions conclude and the 200-plus attendees straggle into a huge hall for dinner. Alongside the older folk is a new generation of activists dedicated to ending extractive economies while also building a movement that supports the construction of just relationships. The website of the North American Forest and Climate Movement proclaims, \u201cWe promote \u00a1Buen vivir!\u2014life in harmony between humans, communities, and the Earth where work is not a job to make others wealthier, but for a livelihood that is sustaining, fulfilling, and in tune with the common good.\u201d The conveners of the North American Forest and Climate Movement Convergence are asking for no less than societal transformation. For those of us researching as part of the Mississippi: An Anthropocene River project at Confluence Ecologies (Field Station 4), it felt important to engage with this organization in solidarity and around our shared commitments to planetary health. And so, a \u201cConflurgence\u201d was born with the Asian Carp Convivial Meal. The forest folk promote \u00a1Buen vivir! and reciprocally we wanted to add \u00a1Con vivir! through a convivial engaging of the togetherness of forest and river as precarious ecologies, and of the Asian carp and humans as entangled species. My artist/biologist collaborator Andy Yang and I have been mapping the social and ecological relationships between humans and Asian carp in the lower Mississippi river system, by researching fisheries policy, river engineering, commerce, and human dietary habit. We are energized by the question of what it would take for people to perceive their own watershed as a source of plentiful and nutritious food. Field Station 4 has joined this convening of activists and knowledge-givers to share a meal, and to contribute to this meal regionally grown and wild-caught fish that have been cast as an enemy species. These two varieties of Asian carp, bighead and silver, were introduced as an experiment in the biological control of algae growth in aquaculture operations. The carp efficiently cleaned up algae, but then they escaped into the rivers to become a newer \u201cweed.\u201d Although treasured as a tasty source of protein in China, bigheads and silvers get a bad rap in the US. They are bony and strange looking, and the silvers have a nasty habit of leaping out of the water, presenting a hazard to humans in boats. People chat in small groups, find seats for themselves at the communal tables, and then line up for a banquet-style service. The kitchen staff sets out the food. The tables are covered with our novelty printed-paper placemats that playfully share information about the fish\u2014their nutritional value (high in protein and omega-3s!) and their histories as immigrants.

The connection between forest and fish and rivers and people seems more pointed in the weeks following the event, as we watch fires burning in Brazil as land is converted from forest cover to cattle fodder. What might a recuperative ecology look like for forests and rivers alike? We try to imagine people eating protein from local rivers\u2014eating the river\u2014so that the load of Asian carp on the riverine ecosystem is reduced and, at the same time, so that the region\u2019s production and import of beef, with all its externalities, is minimized. We try to imagine a thriving carp economy replacing the waste of the beef and fossil fuel economies. Sustainability means it might be necessary to reduce expectations of dietary consistency, to accept that food and fish have their seasons, just as do humans. In the moments we are given to speak, Andy says, \u201cAs the fish enters your body, you become part of the ecology too.\u201d It is almost like an oath. The changes we hope for will be much longer in the coming and they will take many more such experiments, but for this evening, as I am told by one attendee, the room was full of love. Recipe for silver and bighead carp filets for 200 people Approx. 65 pounds bighead and silver carp filets 32 lemons (1 lemon per 2 pounds of carp) Approx. 33 teaspoons ground mixed peppercorns (1/2 teaspoon per pound of carp) Approx. 50 teaspoons salt (1/2 to 1 teaspoon per pound of carp) 65 tablespoons brown butter (smear of brown butter per pound of carp) 2-3 Cups of capers. (Figure 1-2 TB per lb. of filet to taste) Olive oil (optional) Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F Lay out filets on baking tray Squeeze lemon on both sides Sprinkle on some olive oil, if using Sprinkle both sides of filets with salt and ground peppercorns Smear both sides with brown butter.* Bake 10 to 15 minutes; done when flakey Put in serving dish with some of the sauce left in the pan and sprinkle with capers *To brown butter, first bring the butter to room temperature. Then cut up the butter into even walnut-sized pieces. Place butter in a thick-bottomed saucepan. A light-colored pan will help you see the browning progress. Let the pieces melt on low heat. Then turn to medium heat, and steadily stir the melted butter with a whisk or heatproof spatula. It will start to foam. Keep stirring. After 5-10 minutes, the butter liquid will turn golden brown as the milk solids sink to the bottom of the pan. Once the solids have settled and turned brown, and your liquid is golden brown, turn off the heat. The result will smell nutty and richly buttery and keeps well under refrigeration. Bring to room temperature before preparing the fish.",

In order to find out how Slow Media works, it is useful to work actively with Slow Media. Slow Media is thus work in progress, conceptualizing concepts and experimenting with them, creating representations and using them at once. In the case of the Anthropocene, Slow Media is a very pluralistic instrument\u2014not just to reflect anthropocenic issues, but also as a possibility to inquire into the mapping and interpretation of the Anthropocene by contemporaries. Understood in this way, Slow Media is first and foremost a possibility to reflect and understand fuzzy concepts such as the Anthropocene by using them creatively. They are an emergent property of their use. Both the participants in and the instructors on the seminar demonstrated impressively the numerous possibilities to grasp anthropocenic topics, but also to develop methods for nonlinear and multi-perspective storytelling. The most important feature of the seminar was certainly the heterogeneity of the group and the smaller working clusters; participants from the arts, sciences, social sciences, and humanities had to work together. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that heterogeneity itself can be seen as a method in developing Slow Media approaches.",

This essay, stemming from experiences in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, found a good suture point in the context of the HKW and more specifically within the context of the 2016 seminar and workshop titled \u201cKnowing (in) the Anthropocene.\u201d The peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta understand that if they were to fail to keep their environment in harmony it would mean worldwide mayhem. If they fail to address the constellation of forces that are at play each time that we\u2014the supreme predator\u2014intervene in the scene, the human race will not survive. However, here is the crucial part that should be understood: they conceive of this disaster in what we will call here holographic terms, where the whole is in each of its parts. Thus, in the Kogi, Arhuaco, Wiwa, and Kankuamo understanding of the world\u2014as it has flowed down to them in the stream of oral tradition\u2014the day the metabolism of the Sierra fails, that day will also mean apocalypse for the entire planet. It is a supreme lesson to all of us: that to take care of one\u2019s own minuscule site of dwelling is a matter of life and death to the species. The idea of a new era called the Anthropocene, with a beginning\u2014fuzzy as it may be\u2014would probably feel like a great conceptual delusion to them, since they were always already in that era.",

                "text": "The Girl\u2019s Dream The Kogi are one of four linguistic communities (Kogi, Arhuaco, Wiwa, and Kankuamo) that compose the civilization of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia. With the help of an extraordinary nonprofit organization based in Washington, the Amazon Conservancy Team, the Colombian Ministry of Culture purchased land at the Tayrona beach for the Kogi tribe of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia. The Kogis also contributed their own money for the purchase. It is right to be talking about this civilization in the past tense, since for decades now, ever since the marijuana boom of the 1970s at least, forces have been infecting the Sierra with disharmony; but the bed of its coherence is there, ready to flower again. The disharmony in fact had already been introduced to the area by \u201ccacophonic barbarians\u201d at the beginning of the sixteenth century. This is exactly when the four tribes\u2014the Kogi, Arhuaco, Wiwa, and Kankuamo\u2014ran to the hills and were forced to leave their mother sea, which was an integral part of the dynamics of their life on Earth, alongside the mountain. Why was it the Ministry of Culture and not a Ministry of Ecology that pitched in to buy the land? Because it was not an ecological matter, not in the way that we understand ecology, but it was also definitely not a cultural matter. To try to consider it in this way would limit understanding of what is essentially an affair that takes place in a dimension quite unaccountable to a Western contemporary nomenclature. Thus, it was an extraordinary move on the part of the Ministry of Culture to pay heed to a story that doesn\u2019t stand any test in our material-scientific paradigm, and to act upon it, using the \u201cimmaterial cultural heritage argument\u201d as a framework for the transaction. In parenthesis, let me mention here that the Kogis are well respected throughout Colombia, more than many other indigenous tribes. The Kogi lifestyle is also sought eagerly by the fashion-fast-track-enlightenment-seeking crowd that continues to grow worldwide. A catchy hook for that group\u2014whether for good or for bad\u2014is that the Kogis call the rest of us their \u201clittle brothers.\u201d Thus, it is all very conducive having this crowd of enlightenment-seeking pilgrims find the wisdom of their big brothers in the Sierra \u2026 and in doing so, a new threat is brought to the fragile ecology, this time from the mystic-chic sphere. Even the president of Colombia, it seems, wanted to have some of this spiritual allure rub off on him when he staged his inauguration event up in the Sierra with the Mamos (male shamans from the Sierra). All this goes to show that the peoples of the Sierra are much more in vogue now than they ever were before.     Few know that the National Museum in Bogot\u00e1 closes to the public once a year. This is to allow a delegation that comes from the Sierra to take care (hyper-dimensionally, or on the level of code) of the mummy that is exhibited as part of the permanent collection there. According to the Mamos, something needs to be re-established in the mummy periodically, and the Museum abides with this. This is proof of the high esteem in which the Kogi are held. The land purchased for the Kogis down by the beach is far away from their traditional dwelling-place in the Sierra, but they were able to vindicate that their being cut off from this ancestral land of their elders was a concrete problem. This reason may lie in the belief that there is a corridor through which the spirits transit. This corridor must be clear of external influences, otherwise the sacred land loses its capacity to be the portal that it is, and the Sierra dies, in the same way that mangrove trees die if the right flow of fresh and salt water isn\u2019t available. Other arguments include the need to collect seashells used for the ritual of the poporo,A poporo is a dried gourd containing pulverized seashells that are scraped with a stick in a constant ritual. which involves the use of coca leaves and flour made from burnt groundshells gathered on the beach. However, the main point is that the purchase of the land does not just mean \u201crestitution\u201d but also has to do with a\u00a0hyper-dimensional ecological\u00a0argument where a flow of spirits, or telluric energy, needs protection in order for the health of the mountain to be re-established. Otherwise, a catastrophe would play itself out, in a frequency inaudible to a modern mind; and, down the line, an ecological disaster would follow in the three-dimensional world. This association would be incomprehensible to the white folk, yet it is fully understood, by indigenous wisdom-keepers, to be a consequence of the broken link in the\u00a0code\u00a0that binds the mountain and the sea. Thus, the beach is entangled with the metabolism of the Sierra as a proton might be\u00a0entangled\u00a0with another proton in a quantum experiment, where Newtonian time and space paradigms collapse. In the thinking of the\u00a0Mamos, there is no question about a link; call it ecological, technological, or technospiritological, the fact is that the issue plays itself out in an immaterial system, a program called the\u00a0Sierra Nevada de Santa Martawhose physical presence is only one of its aspects, like phenotype to genotype. Now this sequence of entanglements relating to the purchase of the land has to be finished by its beginnings. A story needs a beginning and an end, but not necessarily in that order, as a good filmmaker once said. The miracle starts with a girl\u2019s dream, a bright vision, where she inexplicably realized that the land by the beach, which was worth a fortune, had to be returned to the Kogis. This, too, is a story of entanglements that goes from dreams to miracles. She stated in 2005 that she would \u201cwalk the path all the way to the end, for this land to return to its rightful guardians.\u201d Her father was the actual owner of the land, and he could have sold it to one of a number of hotel corporations for a huge sum, but instead he reduced the price to relatively nothing so that the 1,300 meters of prime real estate beach\u2014otherwise the sacred land of\u00a0Jaba Ta\u00f1iwashkaka\u2014could be purchased for the Kogis. He took some convincing, but he eventually gave in to his daughter\u2019s spiritual force.     Synesthesia I was invited to a ceremony on the night after we had witnessed the villagers building a new communal house on the Sierra. Practically all of the inhabitants of that minuscule, utterly archaic indigenous settlement joined in, and got it ready in a single afternoon. The smaller the size of the participant, the higher on the roof they were: as the pattern got tighter, you could see younger and younger children weaving away towards the vortex of the dome. A downward geometric basket, bright green, the color of fresh palm-tree branches, stood there firmly at dusk. I remember reflecting on the idea that communism had supposedly emerged and died in a\u00a0Western\u00a0narrow conception of history, and here you had a vision of communal action with less bureaucracy, with what appeared to be like an instinctive commitment to collective achievement. The invitation was a big honor for a \u201clittle brother\u201d like me; it was also a male-only affair. The world is composed of the feminine and the masculine at all levels, including plants like coca and tobacco and elements of the landscape like the beach and the mountain. Thus, emphasis on the difference of the activities of men and women is set forth as crucial. Feminine is humid and masculine is dry; from there on it is all about the balance of the two attributes of the Universe. I broke protocol consciously by deciding to bring my own poporo to the ceremony. Not being from one of the four tribes, I should not have had one. My poporo was a gift from a Kankuamo\u2014a member of the tribe that gradually abandoned all of its traditions, and lost its language altogether. The Kankuamo who gave it to me was our host on another expedition to the other face of the Sierra. He facilitated our encounters with a Wiwa Mamo and a Wiwa Saga\u2014male and female shamans respectively\u2014and acted a bit as a travel agent might, while still being romantically fascinated with his own forlorn history, even as he acted like a slave-owner towards the Wiwas, whom he had hired as help around the farm. However, the Mamo and the Saga were another story to him: they were to be his main attraction for the mystic-chic crowd that he could foresee coming in hordes when the word \u201cviolence\u201d finally stopped rhyming with the word \u201cColombia.\u201d Therefore, he was sincerely deferential to their wisdom. Both the Mamo and the Saga supposedly had been raised as shamans of the tribe in the ancient way where the subject remains in a cave for most of their childhood: a technique that heightens all the other senses that would otherwise be superseded by the prominence of the sense of vision. I was aware that our Kankuamo host had trespassed on an ancient law by giving me my own poporo but in my mind there was a justification in his act, unconscious though it might have been.     Anyhow, after examining the implications of the incongruence of a \u201cwhite\u201d Colombian man bringing a poporo to the ceremony, I decided to do so, and I entered the older, and much larger, north-facing communal house, which was divided into four parts, with as many large bonfires in each partition. Like every building in the village, it was made out of impressively woven palm-tree ribbons. My presence\u2014poporo in hand\u2014seemed to cause a silent commotion. I could sense all around the large ceremonial building the mixed feelings I generated among the pharaoh-like men with long black hair, wearing single-piece, white linen dresses. At a certain point things changed and some of them warmed up to the big city fellow and his vain efforts to achieve the art of poporear. The first step is to dip a stick into the pulverized seashells that lie in the deep belly of a phallus-shaped dried gourd, which has an orifice punched in its top. Then one has to swipe the chalk against a bunch of coca leaves that one has previously pressed against one\u2019s upper gums. All this must be done without touching one\u2019s lips otherwise they get burnt by the chalk. Once one has done this, a greenish saliva mixture made out of the three elements is scraped gently with the stick. One proceeds to use the stick as a paintbrush, creating a patina on the top part of the poporo. Layer after layer, the upper part of the dried gourd will become like a green marble sculpture. Since one uses the poporo while conversing with other men, it is as though a man is constantly writing an abstract version of his own words on the gourd. The poporo has many implications during a man\u2019s life: it is a recreation of the origin myth\u2014a constant staging of the \u201claw of the center\u201d and a constant recreation of the Universe. It is also a \u201ccosmic wife,\u201d given to the newly married young man to help him master his libido. Both girls and boys are taught how to employ their sexuality in writing the code that keeps the holographic Sierra healthy. The energy liberated in the sexual act needs always to be \u201cdedicated\u201d to the Sierra, and many habits go in that same direction. For both sexes, different techniques are used through which these principles are woven into quotidian life. Of course, the corruption of all these principles abounds, since nowadays the lower villages receive a steady flux of filmmakers and extreme tourists that gradually mutates their worldview; but the coherence of an ancient pre-Christian lifestyle is still operating.     Two things are worth mentioning out of the many impressions from that night. One of them is that someone asked me in broken Spanish if I was a Kankuamo. Obviously, in the mind of the person who posed the question there could be no other explanation as to why I knew how to use a poporo. The shape of my poporo could also have been the clue, since each one of the four tribes has a particular shaped poporo, owing to the fact that the gourds from each area are different. But to me it was much more significant: the issue belonged to a broad conversation I had while in Mexico with Antonio Velasco Pi\u00f1a and others of his entourage. Maybe the question had come from a very perceptive mind, from one who was looking at me with new eyes. Someone who could see me\u2014and by that I mean people like me\u2014individuals who are there neither in the guise of classical anthropologists nor documentary filmmakers; nor even within the frame of what is current in the contemporary art world. To put it bluntly, I am neither there studying the patterns of the woven textiles to translate them into an artwork nor doing a conceptual restitution of stolen artifacts to expose cultural colonialism, both of which would be understood as artistic research in the art world.This is also why I naturally belong to the community that gravitates to the question of what is the human being, once her/his shadow is cast on the formations that the geologist examines. Geology being as exact a science as there ever was, the Pandora\u2019s Box is fully open when the distinction is erased between the social and the exact, which is what happened when stratigraphy showed signs that it was about to bite its own tail (\u201cI name an objective world outside, but I suddenly realize it carries my own name,\u201d which is why the secret name of the Anthropocene is tautology). The event of the word Anthropocene was as disruptive to our traditional epistemology as the quantum double-slit experiment was to Newtonian physics. I am spontaneously linked to this strange philosophical impasse, although from a strange angle: I am also logically affiliated to the question of what knowing (in) the Anthropocene might mean. I am involved, through and through, in questions that are of the same quality as theirs. In a sense, I have shed some of my Western skin since starting to partake in a kind of learning that is describable only in metaphors, and which, basically, makes me a pariah in the land of hard-core common sense. Thus, this knowledge pertains to a perception of an impenetrable order of which one sees only reflections. Within art history I belong to a frequency that resonates with a pre-industrial tune, something like a painter rendering what happened on the road to Emmaus on large canvasses, repeating it multiple times, trying to let the substance of the event exceed its anecdotal, political, and religious-administrative dimensions. Coming back to the ceremony: musicians played flutes\u2014made out of a plant called Bukunkuisicon\u2014until dawn, pausing occasionally. I used my poporo for hours and listened. At one point, I experienced the most astounding synesthesia: the music provoked vivid images of vegetation and water, a kind of matrix of green patterns and crystalline streams where one could figure out infinite forms, which mutated constantly into others.     I also had a vision about me, and others like me. We had understood from the Wiwa Mamo on the previous trip that the disappearance of the Kankuamo culture was a catastrophe for the hologram of the Sierra, since one of the legs of the table was missing, which meant, of course, that it was tilting, and the erosion of the mountain was there to show it. Mamo Rom\u00e1n had also said that his grandfather had predicted white people coming from the depths of the industrial world and reconnecting with ancestral wisdom in new and untold ways. He meant people who would be bound to this wisdom through their own personal visions, who would not come in expeditions to meet the anthropologized other,\u201cThere might be some Yanomami here among us &#8230;\u201d was a response from a member of the public to a statement made on stage by a speaker who affirmed that bringing the Yanomami into the conversation, or any other non-Western Cosmo vision, was always done in the guise of an \u201canthropologized other\u201d (Anthropocene Campus, HKW, 2014). but rather arrive as fellows on the same path. I saw a coincidental diagram, like the one I know from Antonio Velasco Pi\u00f1a\u2019s prodigious Mexico. Me-xhi-co is upheld by three traditions\u2014the Maya, Zapotec, and Nahautl\u2014all of which are still alive today, practicing the wisdom passed down through generations. Yet the fourth, the Olmec tradition, is a more mysterious affair: the historical Olmecs have disappeared, therefore they have had to be replaced by contemporary non-tribal initiates, by mestizos who have had to download an actualized Olmec wisdom. These new actors are the ones who complete the diagram of four, the ones who keep the holographic Me-xhi-co in balance. We talk here about a configuration that is well known to a biologist or a chemist: an entity is always at the limit of chaos, and it is there, in that limit, that a new formation takes shape, which makes that which seemed to be fixed in a closed circuit become an ever-mutating spiral of actualizations. In the universe of the Sierra Nevada, the story is identical: you have Kogis, Arhuacos, and Wiwas, but the fourth energy has been left loose, a morphogenetic field that finds its next incarnation in this new, unexpected visitor to the land of coherence. An apparent catastrophe, such as the disappearance of the historical Kankuamos and their complementary energy, would be the door through which a new table of four is configured: a new singularity takes shape, beyond its event horizon. It is for this reason that Velasco Pi\u00f1a insists that our future lies inside the powerhouse of the spiritual mestizo, who actualizes tradition and brings it back to life but within the harmonious craft of the ancient order, not as random progress, not as a ravaging cacophony. In other words, with insight into the entire evolving cycle &#8230; in which there are numbers, just like there are numbers in our DNA.     This discussion comes back to why we chose to use the word civilization. Why apply the word civilization to the amalgam of entities that we have called the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta? Because it is not just a mixture of tribes, the term could be situated in plain words through the simple idea of a gelling point: an aggregate of parts that becomes a unit, a compound, with new and particular internal dynamics. It might also stand comparison with a crystal, an entity that generates a coherent field outwards and inwards. A pyramid has these same characteristics: an apex is bound to the four corners of its base, with both the Pi and Phi, its irrational power vortexes at work creating all kinds of coherent fields, which keep generating subfields, in fractal mode. A civilization is a generative, dynamic shape, and the formation\u2014people and land\u2014that makes up the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta has such a form, dimensionally and hyper-dimensionally (what we have called holographically). Like the delta of the Nile and its kaleidoscopic mirrors of life and afterlife on the east and the west banks of the river, with its bifurcating constellation of Upper and Lower Egypt in a perpendicular axis, which copies the night sky; where the Nile is turned on as an earthly reflection of the Milky Way. Likewise, the Sierra is a site where coherence is/was/will be abundant; as in all the other places where a mirror of the order of the Universe was set in place with intention. But the phenomenon needs to take shape again: the Kankuamo energy must re-find its place, and with it a new scale of its internal order will make its appearance.   Tuma The following day we sat in front of the council of Kogi Mamos who wanted to know who we were, and to consult on whether we were welcome by the Sierra. We noticed that some of them were dropping small objects into dried gourd bowls filled with water and observing them very carefully as they sunk. They were dropping tumas. We were introduced to the technology of the tuma on our previous trip: Mamo Rom\u00e1n from the Wiwa tribe insisted that we needed to help repatriate a number of them from a museum in Berlin. Archeologists had excavated them in the Sierra many years ago, and their absence was still the reason for multiple ecological imbalances. Tumas are cylindrical pieces, five centimeters long and one centimeter thick, made out of specific minerals. Each tuma has a direct correspondence with a certain aspect, element, or living being of the Sierra. There is a tuma entangled with the water system, another entangles with a certain species of vegetation; another with the birds; another with feline predators, and so on. I use the term entanglement here deliberately: the toolbox of the quantum laboratory may lend us the most specific and pointed terms to describe the dynamics at play when a Mamo employs his tuma. The tuma is a device that is in place to establish a coherent dialog between the mountain and the four tribes that have the mandate to care for the \u201cheart of the world,\u201d mandate given by Father Serancua at the beginning of the Holographic Sierra (even though at the beginning there was no beginning). The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is not just a mountain (and nothing in it is just a tree, or just an animal, or just a river), it is a sphere, whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere, a paradox used to describe God or the Universe, whose original author is lost in the mists of time.     The word\u00a0code\u00a0came up spontaneously on the part of the translator when trying to explain the workings of the Kogi shamanic world while attempting to describe how\u00a0tumas\u00a0actually work. He explained that each\u00a0tuma\u00a0had a counterpart, a double, which had been implanted in the mountain since time immemorial. When a\u00a0tuma\u00a0is dropped into the bowl, and as the tiny bubbles rise, what is appearing before the eyes of the\u00a0Mamo\u00a0is a direct impression, or expression, of the\u00a0code. The quanta contained in the inverted dome of the gourd itself, is a tiny reflection from the infinite matrix of the Sierra; and, on another octave, a mirror of the whole Universe. Each\u00a0tuma\u00a0offers a reading of one particular aspect\u2014water, animal life, vegetable world, etc.\u2014but it is also involved in a system where the Human is not only auscultating but very much active within the metabolism of the holographic mountain.\u00a0Tumas, in short, are similar to the needles used in Chinese acupuncture, where a certain part of the hand, for example, links to the liver. Both systems connect to the concept of a \u201cZodiac man\u201d as well as Europe\u2019s esoteric twelfth-century medicine, whereby each part of the body had a corresponding constellation by way of which it could be healed.   Pergamento, or always already in the Anthropocene The music I had heard the night before is called chicote, which is also the word used to describe a technique that establishes a connection to vital parts of the metabolism of the Sierra. The whole of the Sierra Nevada is a living body whose organs need nurturing in order for it to remain healthy and alive. Human beings have the responsibility to rewrite the code that regenerates the plant, animal, and water worlds, since indiscriminate use, without deep-seated replenishment, would lead to disaster. The responsibility is great, considering, as mentioned, that the peoples of the Sierra understand that if they fail to keep their environment in harmony, this means worldwide mayhem. If they fail to address the constellation of forces that are at play each time that we, the supreme predator, intervene in the scene, the human race will not survive. Here lies the crucial part of all of this that ought to be understood: the locals conceive of this disaster in what we have called here holographic terms, where the whole is in each of its parts. So in the Kogi, Arhuaco, and Wiwa understanding of the world\u2014as it has flowed down to them in the stream of oral tradition\u2014the day that the metabolism of the Sierra fails, that day will also mean apocalypse for the entire planet.     It is a supreme lesson to us all: that to take care of one\u2019s own minuscule site of dwelling is a matter of life and death to the species. The idea of a new era called the Anthropocene with a beginning\u2014fuzzy as it may be\u2014would probably feel like a great conceptual delusion to them, since they were always already in that era\u2014pagamento being the active expression of this idea. They were also always already in conversation with a technospherePeter Haff\u2019s neologism of a \u201cquasi-autonomous system whose dynamics constrains the behaviour of its human parts.\u201d of sorts, since the Sierra itself is a kind of\u00a0maquina(machine). And they would have always understood\u2014through the powerhouse of their mythological matrix\u2014that the Sierra is at the very heart of the world, and that every other Sierra is as well, when it gets activated as such. This mythological matrix has the\u00a0beginning and the end\u00a0of the Universe on the same table, at\u00a0all times. These peoples would also have understood that we are all on the edge of a catastrophe that will wipe out all life on Earth, if we do not relearn how to partake in co-writing the code that makes the wind blow and the rain fall.There is another coherent mountain we\u2019ve visited a couple of times in Peru, called Marcahuasi. A technique is in place there, where, at times of drought, four exceptional individuals are called upon (exceptional according to both their faith and their knowledge) from four neighboring villages, to go on an expedition down to the sea. Their mission is to collect salt water in four tanks from a specific area of the ocean, which they need to reach via motorboat. The treasury of each municipality helps fund the expedition from public money. The individuals split up and each climbs the mountain separately, carrying their share of seawater, along with ceremonial elements such as tobacco and carnations, to four specific spots where they place the tanks and proceed to leave the lids half open. As they walk down the mountain\u2014after completing each secret ceremony of words and ritual passed down to them by tradition\u2014the clouds are already gathering, and it soon rains. We were informed that one of the most important parts of the technique is to calculate how much of a gap to leave on the tank\u2019s lid, since too wide an opening will create a raging storm. Using cutting-edge science one can justify the formation of clouds by ionized water placed at specific parts of a mountain where the air dynamics tend to rise, etc. What is interesting is the emphasis on the fact that the technique also involves this group of activated individuals who have learned the invisible code of the method. The secret ingredient that makes this example resonate is that the magic science employed in this ancient procedure is not by any means reducible to either the right or left hemisphere. It is both poetry\u2014with carnations laid on the floor\u2014and science, fully entangled as one single metabolism involving the airstream in the mountains, seawater, flower, tobacco smoke, word, gesture, and human intention. In the end, this only means to partake creatively in a\u00a0metabolism. The most interesting etymology of\u00a0religion\u00a0is\u00a0re ligare, to bind again, to actively recreate the severed connection. There is a question, which it is necessary to point out, about what action means in this context: there is an\u00a0action\u00a0needed for this binding to take place, but the action that we speak about here is not action in the sense we understand it colloquially. There is a certain awareness that is in action just by its presence in the room, and that the\u00a0qualitiesof the occurrences that gravitate towards it are not easily explicable from a more\u00a0realisticperspective. There is\u00a0action\u00a0in the strong sense of the word, and then there is another kind of\u00a0action\u00a0where a world with very different parameters is founded. And when this world opens up, thanks to a mixture of intention and technique (and certain numbers) then there is no place for the question \u201cIs it possible that it did take place?\u201d but rather for the question \u201cCan I attain the state where it does take place?\u201d I asked the Mamos about the ceremony from the previous night. I heard again how the music of the\u00a0chicote\u00a0invokes particular living beings from the Sierra. This particular ceremony\u2019s intention was to re-establish the code that generates the palm trees that had been cut down to build the communal house on the previous day. The music itself is the instrument used to write the code for that particular palm tree, as a morphogenetic partition, in order for it to be generated in abundance and then be nurtured by matrix-Sierra. I realized that I had been able to play out a little bit of that code in my head, in the form of those beautiful images that the music had produced in my perceptive field. I had acted as a decoder, as the DVD player is to the disc, or the radio receiver to the wave. I had inadvertently partaken in an intimate instant of the poetic technosphere of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.",

We imagine that the river (or lake, or pond, as the case may be) has always been pretty much where it is now, in the configuration we presently see. This exploration examines one place, now known as the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary in St. Paul, Minnesota, and will contain provocations and assumptions that can\u2019t be demonstrated within the confines offered here, but which, nevertheless, might help make sense of the complexity of one particular location on the Mississippi River. The land and water at the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary offer a case study of how humans have lived on the land and with the water systems, have successively dominated these systems and ignored them, and have tried to \u201crestore\u201d those systems, each time following a pattern that seemed like the logical, normative \u201cright,\u201d or the \u201conly\u201d thing to do. I am not Dakota, but I have learned from Dakota people that all of the area where the \u201cTwin Cities\u201d now sit is Dakota homeland. There are many Dakota names across this landscape; in the immediate vicinity of Figures 1 and 2, three names that recur are Wakan Tipi (House of Spirits) for one of the area\u2019s caves, Kap\u2019oza, where a Dakota community was, and mn\u00ed\u017easka (White cliffs, per the Decolonial Atlas). There is much more to know about Dakota relationships with this place, but these are not my stories to tell. More voices from Dakota people about this place can be found online at the Bdote Memory Map and in an article published in the online journal Open Rivers: Rethinking Water, Place, and Community.Mona Smith, \u201cLearning from the Dakota: Water and Place,\u201d Open Rivers: Rethinking Water, Place &amp; Community, no. 11 (2018), http://editions.lib.umn.edu/openrivers/article/learning-from-the-dakota-water-and-place/ As Gwen Westerman and Bruce White note in their indispensable volume of 2012, Mni Sota Makoce, Dakota people have always understood the area around the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers as their home, their place of origin on the Earth. Furthermore, \u201cThe Dakota knew Mni Sota Makoce as a network of connected places, each defined in specific ways.\u201dGwen Westerman and Bruce White, Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2012, p. 81. Between 1805 and 1817, the vicinity of the Vento Sanctuary was the location of Kap\u2019oza village, but that village moved often.Ibid., p. 127. These points are significant: often non-Indigenous people want to \u201cfix\u201d locations or meanings to a particular cartographic point or area. However, this insistence can conflict with some indigenous notions of \u201cwhere\u201d a \u201cplace\u201d even is, and why or how it is important. Dakota names and people remain in this place; subsequent layers of settler, industrial inhabitation have not erased the names or the people, although these later layers make it difficult to see through them to the palimpsest of meanings underneath. British explorer Jonathan Carver \u201cdiscovered\u201d this space in 1766, and for over 200 years, a cave on the site was known as \u201cCarver\u2019s Cave.\u201d A succession of treaties with the Dakota, all subsequently broken, allowed settlers to come to this bend in the Mississippi River and, beginning in 1841, establish the City of St. Paul. Early images and descriptions show the space between the downtown and Dayton\u2019s Bluff to the east to be largely water, where Trout Brook and Phalen Creek come into the Mississippi. Over time in the first few decades of St. Paul\u2019s existence, the \u201cbottomless bog\u201d between downtown and Dayton\u2019s Bluff posed a substantial obstacle to transportation. A few streets crossed the creeks and bottomlands, beginning in the 1870s, using a variety of bridges, culverts, and trestles. Most notably, a 50-foot mound of soil, clay, and miscellaneous materials located in what is now Lowertown was cleared in the late 1870s and hauled east, to fill the \u201cslough of despond\u201d and create space for the rail infrastructure and the city\u2019s first Union Depot.See Greg Brick, Historic Waters of the Capitol Region Watershed District, Ramsey County, MN. Oakdale, MN: Prepared for Emmons &amp; Olivier Resources, Inc., 2008; Josiah B. Chaney, Early Bridges and Changes of the Land and Water Surface in the City of St. Paul. St. Paul, MN: Collections of the Minnesota Historical Society, vol. 12, 1908, pp. 131\u201348; and Paul Hesterman, \u201cThe Mississippi and St. Paul: Change is a Constant for River and the City that Shaped It,\u201d Ramsey County History, vol. 21, no. 1 (1986): pp. 3\u201322.\u00a0A few frame houses hugged the bluff, and at least one brewery made use of the caves in the soft St. Peter sandstone. Yet, the advent of the railroads brought the most dramatic physical change to this space over time. During the second half of the nineteenth century, St. Paul assumed a position as the uppermost port on the Mississippi River and a major transshipment point between riverboat and rails that took goods and people out across the northern plains. What had been a \u201cbottomless slough\u201d had become one of the country\u2019s busiest railyards. It is no mean feat to achieve this sort of land- and waterscape transformation. Writing in the early twentieth century, Josiah Chaney described projects that had filled in sections of the Mississippi River bank between the downtown bluff and Phalen Creek. He lists two projects that created approximately 16 acres of new land, filling out between 100 and 190 feet from the previous shore for a distance of some 4,300 feet (over three-quarters of a mile).Chaney, Ibid. Historian Paul Hesterman also notes that Dayton\u2019s Bluff was cut back extensively during this period, to make more room for the railroad, but nearly destroying \u201cCarver\u2019s Cave.\u201dHesterman, Ibid. Later, during an era of extensive highway construction, the building of Warner Road across this space, which entailed building a raised prism of land to elevate the roadway above ordinary high water levels, further cut the land off from the Mississippi River channel. Students of the class Dimensions of Urban Change will be surprised to learn that an affluent neighborhood, including houses for some of the railroad executives themselves, were demolished in the effort to create more land for the railroad. Marshall Hatfield details the eradication of Lafayette Park and its nearby elegant mansions, how they were swept aside\u2014when \u201copportunity came knocking\u201d\u2014to serve the interests of commerce.Marshall R. Hatfield, \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2014\u2018Tasteful, Elegant\u2019 Lafayette Park and the Homes of the Elite,\u201d Ramsey County History, vol. 29, no. 2 (1994): pp. 4\u201321, here p. 20. The urban planner Ken Greenberg coined the term \u201cthe retreat of the industrial glacier,\u201d and the phrase aptly describes what ensued at the Vento Sanctuary site between the mid-twentieth century and the 1990s.Ken Greenberg, Toronto Reborn: Design Successes and Challenges. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2019. As the railroads gradually deserted the area and the \u201cempty\u201d space filled with trash and junk, the once unwelcoming place that had been dominated by railcars and heavy machinery now became a site of dereliction. During this time, the city and the region\u2019s attention turned to highways and air transportation. The \u201cSwede Hollow\u201d community, which is located immediately upstream (north) along Phalen Creek, was wiped out by the City of St. Paul in 1956, after being described as a health hazard. And although numerous published accounts tell nostalgically of life in \u201cSwede Hollow,\u201d the reports of privies suspended over the creek and an absence of running water or electricity in the community give some credence to this claim. So now, instead of being the city\u2019s \u201cfront door,\u201d the Mississippi River corridor had become the \u201cmud room,\u201d a space where dirty, wet things are discarded out of sight of the more polite parts of the city (or house, to continue the metaphor). Beginning in the 1990s, residents of adjacent neighborhoods started to be concerned that the former railroad site and the hollow where people had lived until recently were detrimental to neighborhood development and well-being. Neighborhood organizations such as Friends of Swede Hollow and the Lower Phalen Creek Project began a series of transformative efforts that have restored the landscape. The area\u2019s new name\u2014Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary\u2014is after a local US congressman who was instrumental in establishing the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (Mississippi NRRA), a unit of the National Park Service (NPS) that follows the river through the Twin Cities. Years of focused effort has replaced the trash-strewn site with ecologically sustainable prairie and oak-savannah planting. A coalition of neighborhood groups, environmental advocacy organizations, and commitments from local, state, and federal government came about to achieve the transformation of a 27-acre brownfield into a valuable, if still hidden, gem, within roughly a decade of intensive activity. Since 2005, after extended community-engagement processes that have centered on the perspectives of Dakota people, an abandoned warehouse building has been demolished, to be replaced, project leaders hope, with a \u201cWakan Tipi Center\u201d that would be a community resource for all.",

                "text": "The case of the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary raises three immediate questions: The site has \u201cdeindustrialized,\u201d but to what end? To serve whose needs? At whose behest? Two decades ago, when I first got involved with Mississippi River work, it seemed to be enough to bring people to the river by providing open space and allowing city governments to drive development/redevelopment projects in the vicinity. These projects, we thought, would bring a constituency to the river. While it is true that they have, it is also true to say that they have remade the river as a \u201cgreen gentrification\u201d zone, attractive to the elite and generating specialty coffee shops, high-end restaurants, and other businesses that are hallmarks of gentrification elsewhere. Thus far, the Vento Sanctuary has resisted this fate, but it\u2019s an open question as to for how long. Thus far, there is minimal signage or other \u201cintrusions\u201d upon the landscape, with only a series of interpretive markers required by the state Department of Natural Resources as a condition for its participation in the land-acquisition project in the early 2000s. But the heavily \u201cbranded,\u201d bustling \u201cLowertown District\u201d and CHS Field, home of the St. Paul\u2019s Saints baseball team, are only a couple of blocks away. As more urban elites come into the area, how much will the essential qualities of the Vento Sanctuary remain? Can \u201crestoration\u201d or \u201cdeindustrialization\u201d escape \u201ccapital,\u201d or is this space, in its latest manifestation, destined to attract the wealthy\u2014albeit demonstrated differently than 100 years ago? If we are unable to return to &#8220;nature&#8221; then what do we call this hybrid human-biological-physical system? The Anthropocene, the term for the &#8220;age defined by humans,&#8221; may provide us with language that focuses our attention to the significant features of this place. &#8220;Anthropocene&#8221; points to the roles of the between spaces like this, as spaces distinctive in and of themselves as well as embedded in larger human and nonhuman systems. Places like the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary are connectors to infrastructure systems, are unqiue points along systems such as the Mississippi migratory bird flyway, and have a particular located history expressed through the stories of wakan tipi. We can see the Vento site as important in its own right, as a place where human meaning and efforts have been layered for thousands of years, and also as a central connector, reaching both upstream and down to more readily visible places such as St. Anthony Falls, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, and Lake Pepin. What we must have is the language that enables us to see through the palimpsest, to describe the layers of the landscape&#8217;s history, and to understand the dynamics of how people made places, understood, and inhabited them over centuries.",

More specifically, this rigidized balloon, named Echo II, was sent into low-level atmospheric orbit to relay signals between distant points on Earth. Other satellites affiliated with the Echo, Telstar, and similar programs likewise supported the transmission of fax images, telephone calls, television images, and feeds, etc., thereby refiguring and consolidating the world\u2014rendering it more \u201csolid [. . .] through its tightly woven interrelations.\u201d Many key thinkers at the time celebrated the increased connectivity ushered in by the expansion of communication networks and electronic media, not to mention commercial airline travel. Marshall McLuhan, for instance, famously characterized this reordered world as a new \u201cglobal village,\u201d wherein breaking news was instantaneously available across the planet\u2019s reach. Others, however, took a more negative view, lamenting the growing impossibility of potential detachment, or autonomy, in a society increasingly enveloped by various circuitry. As a historical artifact, this technological sphere reminds us that the world proceeds by way of precise developments, and it would do us well to remember the past, in its peculiar complexity, as we navigate the present. As an apparatus\u2014and one, like so many others, which emerged from a military\u2012geopolitical context\u2014Echo II prefigured and enabled our world today, wherein the global economy operates with unprecedented power and swiftness. We might, in fact, think of the shipping container\u2014as it plies the world\u2019s oceans aboard sublime-scaled barges, carrying endless goods according to endless financial transactions\u2014as some sort of correlate or derivative, especially if we take seriously filmmakers Allan Sekula and No\u00ebl Burch\u2019s claim in\u00a0The Forgotten SpaceAllen Sekula and Noel Burch,\u00a0The Forgotten Space: A Film Essay Seeking to Understand the Contemporary Maritime World in Relation to the Symbolic Legacy of the Sea. New York: Doc.Eye in co-production with Wildart Film, 2010.\u00a0that it is the fundamental hardware, or architecture, of our day. As a form, it embodies the idea of the world as a single unit\u2014unified by technology, by globalized capitalism, by environmental crisis, and so on. And, more pertinent for Anthropocene discussions, of the human as world and the world as human. That we have largely remade the world in our own image is clear: land is increasingly homogenized by corporate, genetically modified agriculture; urbanization expands in a fashion some describe as \u201cplanetary,\u201d or without outside; biodiversity is plummeting, with those species domesticated or oddly adaptable to human-centered environs (e.g. coyotes, seagulls, cockroaches, certain bacteria) among the few to expand in numbers, like we ourselves. For many of us, there is a sense of entanglement in something so big and accelerated that it seems impossible to identify its edges or ways of extracting ourselves, of finding external places on which to \u201cpitch our tent,\u201d to again borrow Serres\u2019 analogy. The word \u201cAnthropocene,\u201d of course, is meant to capture some of this. Yet, we should also be wary of this concept, including the wildfire pace with which it is being adopted. For broad, planetary frames\u2014like the satellite view from above\u2014have a tendency to subsume particularities into totalities, with the risk of naturalizing, or depoliticizing, states of affairs along the way. The geological dimension of the Anthropocene term only exacerbates this. As the environmental justice scholar Nicholas Brown once meaningfully posed to me, echoing many others\u2019 concerns: What human inequities and violences are smoothed over when we think in terms of deep, rather than historical, time? There is a particular opacity to anthropogenic climate change, one of the defining phenomena of our purported Anthropocene condition, a way in which representation itself is thrown newly into crisis in its midst. Pictures of polar bears atop icebergs, industrial smokestacks, the vast stretches of the Tar Sands in Alberta, Canada, and other devastated landscapes\u2014all these remain, somehow, too linked to a literal, illustrative mode, unable to convey the multiplicity, relationality, and indeed opacity, of it all. One of the key questions we might ask ourselves is how to see and think, relentlessly, the geological and ecological together with the social, economic, political, and ethical, while keeping issues of power and justice always center stage. How to resist images of wholeness in favor of fractured, or stratified, viewpoints that foreground difference?",

                "text": "Introduction The Anthropocene, as an epoch in Earth\u2019s history, has an atmosphere that is different from that of the Holocene. This new geological era marks the moment in a history of the Earth when the reworking of energy and matter by human societies reached the scale of a geological force. According to Peter Haff, the spatial manifestation of the Anthropocene is the emergence of a new geosphere \u2013 the technosphere. The concept of the technosphere highlights the systemic quality of large-scale transformation of the Earth surface by human beings and their technological tools. Humans and technology, or more specifically, the \u201cthe interlinked set of communication, transportation, bureaucratic, and other systems that act to metabolize fossil fuels and other energy resources,\u201dPeter K. Haff, \u201cTechnology as a Geological Phenomenon: Implications for human well-being,\u201d Geological Society Special Publication, vol. 395, no. 1 (2014): pp. 301\u20139; Jan Zalasiewicz et al., \u201cA Stratigraphical Basis for the Anthropocene?,\u201d Geological Society Special Publication, vol. 395, no. 1 (2014): pp. 1\u201321; Kathryn Yusoff, \u201cGeologic Life,\u201d Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, vol. 31 (2013): pp. 779\u201295, here p. 783. are conceptualized by Haff as a historical stage in the geological evolution of the Earth. Here, we argue that conceptualization of the human\u2012nature\u2012technology nexus needs to examine the uneven geographies and power geometries of the Anthropocene epoch as much as to discern people, places, and spaces that in Anthropocene narratives often and otherwise remain invisible. In this short account, we demarcate this point by focusing on the artificial satellites that orbit the Earth. The satellite infrastructure consisting of a globalized chain of production, pollution, and debris succinctly illustrates the expansive, systemic, and geological attributes of the technosphere and, as such, it is the crucial component of the new geography of the Anthropocene. Artificial satellites constitute a spatially remote and historically novel layer in orbit around the Earth. This makes them an exemplary case for tracing specific material histories and technological constraints of the social production of space and human existence in the Anthropocene.Rob Nixon, \u201cThe Anthropocene: The promise and pitfalls of an epochal idea,\u201d Edge Effects (2014), also online [accessed 05/29/2015]; Will Steffen et al., \u201cThe Anthropocene: Are humans now overwhelming the great forces of nature?,\u201d AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment, vol. 36, no. 8 (2007): pp. 614\u201321; Dipesh Chakrabarty, \u201cThe Climate of History: Four theses,\u201d Critical Inquiry, vol. 35, no. 2 (2009): pp. 197\u2013222. Likewise, satellite technologies, embedded within global security, communication, and political agendas,Lisa Parks and James Schwoch (eds), Down to Earth. Satellite technology, industries and cultures. Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2012. thus are paramount for the expansion of the technosphere. The growing use of low Earth orbit (LEO) for observation satellites, launched, in part, for environmental management, is exemplary of the apparent momentum that the technosphere has acquired. Satellite technologies more commonly are perceived through their intended applications such as the global communication networks, environmental observation, and covert and commercial surveillance.Paul N. Edwards, A Vast Machine: Computer models, climate data, and the politics of global warming.

Blarksburg, VA: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 2007. Examples abound, ranging from the conservation of the shrinking Aral Sea in 1994 to the unmasking of Serbian mass graves and genocide in former Yugoslavia in 1998.

Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2011, p. 4. The geological evolution of the Earth\u2019s geospheres leaves material traces in the form of sedimentary strata. These sediments and fossilized remains reflect the changing conditions of the Earth\u2019s surface through deep time. The Anthropocene epoch is becoming apparent in stratigraphic records from across the world.

She argues for the new technostratigraphic approaches that will help us to examine the diverse socio-technological configurations, which are part of the process of producing, using, and reshuffling the manufactured materials that eventually form part of the sedimentary strata. The technofossils for which we search are those that will help us to discern changes in the \u201cinterrelated conception of nature, culture and history.\u201dGabrys*, Digital rubbish*, p. 4. At the end of their life cycle, satellites become space debris that remains in orbit. Although satellites and debris in the LEO eventually disintegrate into the atmosphere after decades or centuries, the density of the layer is sustained by the increasing rate of new satellite launches, illustrating how humans have become dependent on the proliferation of technological objects far away in outer space. Here, we suggest that the space debris orbiting the Earth represents the new technofossils that are exemplary of the epochal changes in Anthropocene. Likewise, the orbital strata formed of debris from satellites and rockets is a new stratigraphic layer that marks an outer boundary of the expanding technosphere.",

                "text": "Material Histories of Satellites A satellite is a material object, yet its origins are seldom discussed. Where do satellite metals originate? What geopolitical relations have made the satellite\u2019s existence possible? Ever since the first satellite\u2014the Soviet Sputnik 1\u2014launched October 4, 1957, engineers have relied on aluminum to construct platforms for them. While satellite functionality depends on a broad range of metals, it is the aluminum alloys that provide the basic structural attributes\u2014lightweight strength, resistance, and machinability\u2014that are necessary for carrying the payload to orbit and sustaining the extremes of temperature in outer space.Mimi Sheller, Aluminum Dreams: The making of light modernity. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2014. As Mimi Sheller asserted, \u201cit was aluminum that made bombs explode, the rockets fire, and the satellites orbit.&#8221;Sheller, Aluminum Dreams, p. 4. Although aluminum is the most abundant metal found in the Earth\u2019s crust, its extraction relies on one specific rock\u2014bauxite\u2014formed by the weathering of sedimentary rocks in warm, moist climates. Accordingly, the majority of bauxite deposits are located in tropical and subtropical near-equator regions, often within the territories of former European colonies. On the other hand, aluminum smelting is an energy-intensive and technologically advanced process hence the vast majority of aluminum production during the twentieth century has been limited to the countries of the Global North (although Russia and China have become major aluminum producers as well). With the exception of China, the main producers of bauxite are not the countries that produce aluminum\u2014the result is a global and highly skewed flow of \u201craw\u201d materials until aluminum is delivered to the principal users.Robin S. Gendron et al., Aluminum Ore: The political economy of the global bauxite industry. Vancouver: UBC Press, 2013. Space enterprises rose sharply during the 1980s, in respect to both previous and later space activities.Jonathan McDowell, \u201cLaunch Log of Satellites,\u201d online (last updated 12/22/2015) (accessed 2/02/2016). National space programs since the early 1970s have developed in Europe and in developing countries, whereby India, China, and Japan have invested enormous resources and political will in national as well as international satellite projects. Meanwhile, the rising demand in satellite-assembly has required a conglomerate of functional materials from locations scattered across the globe.Volker Zepf et al., Materials critical to the energy industry. An introduction, 2nd edn. British Petroleum, London, United Kingdom, 2014. For example, a satellite assembled at the beginning of the 1980s required bauxite that could have originated from one of the twenty-five countries then extracting it, and processed primary aluminum would then have been delivered from one of forty-three countries.British Geological Survey (BGS), World Mineral Statistics 1979\u20131983. London: BGS, 1985, also online (accessed 01/28/2015). Thus, the uneven geographies of raw resources, production, and profit from metals have been left intact now as then. At the same time the space agencies, for example the Swedish Space Corporation, argued for deregulation of rules for acquiring contracts in order to promote partnership with industries. These changes in the early 1980s moved knowledge of satellite assembly beyond the reach of regulators.When the authors contacted personnel at the Swedish National Space Board to inquire about the material components of the SPOT-program, the response was that metals, extraction, and production were facts difficult to trace (December 10, 2014). The difficulties in locating the extraction of metals paired with the industries\u2019 efforts to deregulate the satellite-production chain exemplify the difficulties in tracing the satellite back to its material beginnings. A century ago, wood, brick, iron, copper, gold, silver, and a few plastics were the materials used by humans. By comparison, a modern computer chip consists of more than sixty elements all of which are indispensable for the specific functionalities of the object.Thomas E. Graedel et al., \u201cOn the materials basis of modern society,\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 112, no. 20 (2015), pp. 6295\u2012300. While aluminum and metals in satellites constitute only a fraction of their global production and use, their assembly illustrates the material basis of how the dependence of society on metals dramatically shifted in the Anthropocene. Exploring the material trajectories of a satellite illustrates the increasing flow of metals compared with previous historical periods. These metals have entered the geography of the Anthropocene because humans have assembled them into material artifacts: they occupy specific places on Earth, and are exploited by humans, as Haff would formulate it, because of the increasing demands of the technosphere.",

                "text": "Geopolitics of Pollution and Debris The life cycle of satellites ends with space debris, yet each stage starting from an extraction of raw material, its distribution, assembly, and launch produces environmental pollution. Exploring the material trajectories of metals that make up the latest electronic devices, Armin Reller and Peter Stebbing (2012) demonstrated that the unchecked use and increasing exploitation of metals classified as rare or strategic, links systemically to a range of environmental damage and mass violation of human rights.Armin Reller and Peter D. Stebbing, \u201cMaterials Governance,\u201d Cumulus Conference, 2012, p. 94 also online (accessed 03/15/2015). Besides the direct extraction, there are the issues of uneven distribution and access. Gabrielle Hecht (2009) illustrated how producers set up mining opreations in remote rural areas to establish infrastructures serving primarily continued extraction, and shift ownership of metals several times before these find their end-users. This means that mines for metals extraction are built at the expense of the surrounding landscape and people, and that information concerning their operations is opaque. Regarding aluminum smelting, also of interest is that its high energy-intensive production is a major producer of greenhouse gas emissions.Gabrielle Hecht, \u201cAfrica and the Nuclear World: Labor, occupational health, and the transnational production of uranium,\u201d Comparative Studies in Society and History, vol. 51, no. 4 (2009): pp. 896\u2012914. Thus, although the pollution of extraterrestrial space by satellite debris is becoming an urgent problem in its own right, the production of waste, information opacity, and resulting unequal geographies start at the very beginning of the production chain in mines located in remote territories of China or in former European colonies.Peter Redfieldt, Space in the Tropics.

IOP Publishing, 2013. Depending on which orbit, whether LEO that passes from pole to pole, or geosynchronous orbit (GEO) situated along the equator (Figure 1), the afterlife of satellites ranges from decades to millennia. The closer to Earth a satellite orbits, the quicker it loses altitude and breaks up. Since the early 1990s, all LEO satellites have been programmed to begin descent after twenty-five years, whereas those in GEO orbit are pushed outwards, stretching the extraterrestrial layer farther into outer space.Joel M. Weisberg and Trevor Paglen, \u201cA Temporal Map in Geostationary Orbit: The cover etching on the Echostar XVI artifact,\u201d Astronomical Journal, vol. 144, no. 4 (October 2012). Despite these mitigations, satellite debris continues to accumulate for a number of reasons. During launch and descent satellite components come loose. Adding to this, the number of new satellite launches has greatly outpaced the rate at which existing satellite debris is expected to disintegrate. While there are efforts to track and steer clear of satellite debris, military operators have every interest in keeping reconnaissance satellites hidden from such navigation efforts.Cf. Trevor Paglen, \u201cAFP-731 or The Other Night Sky \u2013 an allegory,\u201d in: Parks and Schwoch (eds), Down to Earth, pp. 240\u201245. Mitigations have also rekindled some of the fears of the Cold War. In 2007, the Chinese government shot down one its own meteorological satellites FY-1C, causing a step-wise increase in the amount of orbital debris. The United States government responded both by condemning the action as a militarization of outer space, and later in February 2008 by conducting a similar experiment on the US intelligence satellite USA-193, receiving similar condemnations, where upon Russian and India proceeded to develop similar missile capacities.B\u00e5rd Wormdal, The Satellite War, eBook. Amazon Distribution, 2013, pp. 162\u201265.

In it, the jazz composer Sun Ra shifted the geopolitical perspective by looking at Earth from outer space, suggesting that our freedom lay in extraterrestrial places. But our account remains much closer to Earth; no satellite can enter outer space and hope to sever itself from the geopolitics from whence it originated.Parks and Schwoch (eds), Down to Earth. During the Cold War of the late twentieth century, satellites were frequently employed as a signifier of progress or the technological tool to \u201csave the world.\u201d Yet, looking closer at examples of satellite infrastructure, the chain of production, pollution, and debris, reveals clearly that, albeit at a relatively isolated layer in space, the satellites remain firmly grounded in the geographically and geopolitically uneven processes on the Earth\u2019s surface\u2014in the post-colonial conflicts, regional exploitation, and in environmental pollution. In addition, although ownership can be traced to the specific actors, other aspects of satellite infrastructure\u2014such as debris generated through launch, operation, and disposal, or the distribution trajectories of their functional materials\u2014are difficult to assign to specific nations or companies. Yet, the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of the infrastructure cannot explain the lack of transparency. Whether due to state deregulation, military, or corporate secrecy, the information about global metal extraction, distribution, or the full scope of satellite programs have never been publicly accessible.Volker Zepf, Rare Earth Elements, a New Approach to the Nexus of Supply, Demand and Use: Exemplified along the use of neodymium in permanent magnets.

This intensification, they argue, is responsible for tipping the earth into the new geologic epoch of the Anthropocene. Looking at fifteen trendlines (such as population growth and water consumption or the presence of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere and the degradation of the terrestrial biosphere), they sketch a depressing, piece-meal portrait of the rapid and negative influence modern humans are having on natural systems around the globe. Two trendlines Steffen et al do not sketch are those connected to the human-driven changes in natural sediment transport and the extraction of subsurface fluids from freshwater aquifers and fossil fuel reserves. The graphs would be equally startling. For instance, one comprehensive study of sediment transport estimates that humans currently move 63,000 million tons of earth per year, exceeding that of global oceans and rivers by a factor of three.Simon J. Price, Jonathan R. Ford, Anthony H. Cooper, and Catherine Neal. \u201cHumans as Major Geological and Geomorphological Agents in the Anthropocene: The Significance of Artificial Ground in Great Britain.\u201d Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences 369, no. 1938 (March 13, 2011): 1056\u201384. Like Steffen et al\u2019s trajectories, these displacements coincide with the large-scale use of combustion engines and heavy earth moving machinery\u2014i.e. around the time of the Second World War. This leads the study\u2019s authors to write that \u201cThe anthropogenic sedimentological record\u201d provides yet \u201canother marker on which to characterize the Anthropocene.\u201dIbid. 1056. While their study captures an impressive measure of human planetary intervention, it grossly underestimates the full impact humans have on global soil mobility. In the absence of reliable data, they do not even attempt to calculate the \u201cinvoluntary transport\u201d of sediments via agricultural runoff and deforestation, nor the obstruction of sediments caused by dams, diversions, and flood control mechanisms. These anthropogenic interventions are likely responsible for an even greater disruption of the natural processes that shape the annual movements of earth.",

Since 1932, the State has lost nearly 2,000 square miles of earth. The current pace of loss is about an American football-field\u2019s worth of land every 100 minutes. Or, a territory the size of Monaco, slipping beneath the waves every month.CPRA. \u201cLouisiana\u2019s Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast.\u201d Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, Louisiana, 2017. What can the State of Louisiana, a territorialized power, do in the face of a creeping, inexorable problem that is shrinking the size of its territory? That is taking away the property of some of its citizens? That is reducing the tax base upon which public expenditures such as flood protection or land restoration depend? In coastal areas, there are two basic paradigms to dealing with these vulnerabilities: you can either help people move to higher ground\u2014what is known in planner parlance as \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d\u2014or you can try and fight these processes of acceleration. Stay put and counteract the land loss by \u201cunsinking\u201d the coast. For the moment, the state of Lousiana has chosen the latter option. And to do so, it has adopted an ambitious approach to coastal loss that we might call \u201coutrunning the Anthropocene.\u201d The contestant in this race is a state agency, the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA), or the Authority. Established after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Authority set about consolidating and systematizing a hodge-podge of interventions designed to hold back flood waters and rebuild storm attenuating wetlands. This collection of interventions, called the CPRA\u2019s Comprehensive Master Plan (2017), or the Plan, is the training manual for the race, whose duration is set for fifty years hence. The race\u2019s winner, however, will not be determined by who crosses the finish line first. It will be won by answering a question of form: i.e. what shape will the coastline of Louisiana be in 2067? And given the rate of accelerating land loss, how much can human action control the shape of that line?",

The most significant of the structural projects is called Morganza-to-the-Gulf, an $8 billion levee system stretching along one-hundred miles of Louisiana\u2019s southern coast. For the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe, Morganza involves heightening its existing dikes from ten feet (good for resisting storm surge from the current 1-in-100 year hurricane) to between sixteen and twenty feet (high enough to ward off the more intense storm surges of the future).

The restoration projects involve what we might call the Greater Acceleration\u2014a state-managed effort to speed up the biological processes that cause land to accrete and grow. The goal, in other words, is to build back the earth faster than it is currently disappearing. Restorations take the form of re-seeding marshes by dredging and/or pumping massive amounts of sediment from other parts of the river basin to the coast, rebuilding barrier islands through sand mining and transport, constructing artificial oyster beds on the bottom of coastal bays (oyster colonies help capture drifting sediment), and planting new, hardier species of land-retaining plants, such as non-native tropical black mangroves (whose growing range is migrating northward with changing temperatures).",

To combat the loss of sediment caused by the Mississippi\u2019s upstream system of levees, dikes, and flood barriers, the Plan calls for creating breaches\u2014known as crevasses\u2014in the system. These holes would theoretically allow the river, at designated points, to spill through human-built barriers and redistribute the soils that are currently dumped in the Gulf of Mexico back into coastal wetlands. One problem with the crevasses, however, is that by supplying coastal areas with more freshwater, they could change the salinity of saltmarshes and threaten sensitive shellfish and shrimp populations upon which local fisherman and their families, such as the Dardars, depend (hence the controversy). There are no designated sediment diversions near Pointe-au-Chien, but Mr. Donald takes me in his flat-bottomed fishing boat to an area in North Terrebonne Bay where the Authority would like to build 5,400 acres of marshland. Reconstructing these marshes will cost an estimated $299 million, yet it is not evident where funding will come from (nor how the marshes will be maintained as sea-level rise and subsidence continue to counteract reconstruction efforts). Of the $50 billion total expenditures projected by the Plan, roughly $19 billion are earmarked for structural interventions, $6 billion for non-structural risk reduction, and $25 billion for coastal restoration work.",

But \u201cstaying put\u201d also needs to be understood in light of other imperatives of protection, like protecting the interests of corporations who operate along the coast, particularly those in the fossil fuel sector.It should be noted that the oil and gas industry contributes a percentage of royalties from Gulf mineral exploration and extraction to state coastal restoration efforts via two principal funds. These sums amount to a few tens of millions of dollars per year; a small portion of the industries&#8217; revenues and not anywhere near the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to implement the Plan; cf CPRA 2017, 128. Oil and gas production and chemical processing represent an enormous slice of Louisiana\u2019s economy, but they also contribute to the emissions driving sea level rise, to land subsidence from pumped wells, and to the unraveling of coastal wetlands as hundreds of miles of dredged pipelines and shipping canals eat through bayou country. On the ground, the changes in the land are often difficult to visualize. One year the marsh grasses are there, the next they are not.

The deep paradox at the heart of the Authority\u2019s approach is that with fossil fuel extraction and emissions continuing apace, the speed of interventions will likely make a minimal dent in the expected loss.

G. Bosch and David J. Miller, The Holobiont Imperative. Vienna: Springer, 2016. while trying to understand the flourishing of oyster\u2019s beds in the Kiel Bay, which was famous for this kind of crustacean delicacy during the eighteenth century. The term indicates the dependence of all the organisms of a community upon one another. Moreover, it links the organisms to factors of their environment, such as water temperature and salinity, and it accounts for the number of organisms of each species. M\u00f6bius witnessed this interdependence by counting more than three hundred organisms sheltered within the valves of just two oysters. This prompted him to warn the local community of fishermen and traders to consider this delicate interconnection so as not to follow the example of Cancale in France, where oyster populations were depleted by overfishing.Karl Moebius, Die Auster und die Austernwirthschaft. Berlin: Hempel &amp; Parey, 1877. As a result of this, in France the ecological niche previously occupied by oysters was taken up by mussels and cockles, a change that for years prevented any possible reestablishment of the oyster population. As M\u00f6bius\u2019 studies show, almost two centuries ago, the wild oysters that called French shores home were put in danger by humans. By contrast, in New Orleans, restaurants protect customers with a weakened immune system by showing them warnings associated with the consumption of oysters from the area, which can cause severe illness in some people and even death. The reason for such caution lies in the Louisiana industrial development since the beginning of the twentieth century when oil refineries were first built and started to exert environmental, selective pressures on microorganisms\u2019 metabolism to eventually contribute to the rise of antibiotic resistance. The key dynamics explaining the different role played by French oysters during the nineteenth century compared with oysters currently being fished in the Gulf of Mexico relates to selective pressures imposed by the industry at the microscopic scale. Specifically, this affects bacteria, which have delicate and highly dynamic equilibria, and are thus extremely sensitive to external conditions. Most importantly, since bacteria are necessary for all living beings to develop and survive, and since they can rapidly communicate to each other, their status directly impacts human health. Lateral gene transfer (aka horizontal gene transfer), which is the molecular, evolutionary mechanism allowing a rapid \u201ccommunication\u201d across bacteria and between bacteria and viruses, and which explains antibiotic resistance, has been studied for almost seventy years and is the biological hallmark of the Anthropocene.Michael R. Gillings, \u201cLateral gene transfer, bacterial genome evolution, and the Anthropocene,\u201d Annals of The New York Academy of Sciences, vol. 1389 (2017): pp. 20-36. Bacteria are the material, elemental interface between multicellular organisms and the environment. They can quickly change their genome in cases of external stress to develop resistance to dangerous, environmental factors. Synthetic chemicals such as antibiotics used in aquaculture and livestock, or phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizers, play a major role in the genetic variation of bacteria\u2014a dynamic that can easily lead bacteria to develop and share resistance to these elements.",

This happens via agricultural runoff and wastewater treatment plants present throughout the long journey of the river. These human activities spill antimicrobials, heavy metals, and elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the water, all acting as co-selecting agents to elicit the development and spread of antimicrobial-resistant aquatic bacteria.Ali Liaqat et al., \u201cNutrient-induced antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus faecalis in the eutrophic environment,\u201d Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance, vol. 7 (2016): pp. 78-83; Christine C.

In 2007, a team of researchers from Louisiana State University found antibiotic resistance in Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus bacteria extracted from oysters sampled in the Mississippi River, the Louisiana Gulf, and in retail raw oysters.Feifei Han et al., \u201cAntimicrobial Susceptibilities of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus Isolates from Louisiana Gulf and Retail Raw Oysters, \u201cApplied and Environmental Microbiology vol. 73, no. 21 (2007): pp. 7096-8. A decade later, in 2018, bacteria resistant to carbapenem, monobactam, penicillin, tetracycline, sulphonamide, and cephalosporin antibiotics, and related resistance genes were consistently found in the coastal water of Louisiana. Cameron Bedling and Raj Boopathy, \u201cPresence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in coastal recreational waters of southeast Louisiana, USA,\u201d Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology-Aqua vol. 67, no. 8 (2018): pp. 800\u2013809. Both wild and farmed, the fish and shellfish living in these waters metabolize the aquatic bacteria and therefore acquire antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance and the risk of ill health it provides in humans is a phenomenon that has increased at the planetary scale during the last century, and has been known about since the introduction of Penicillin a century ago.Hannah Landecker, \u201cAntibiotic resistance and the biology of history,\u201d Body and Society vol. 22, no. 4 (2016): pp. 19-52. Antibiotics such as sulphonamides, which are by-products of coal-tar, are part of the economy of heavy industry, and are used in several sectors, from the agroindustry to public health. The multiple selective pressures elicited by synthetic molecules of various kinds creates so-called superbugs such as Acinetobacer baumanii, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria are resistant to most, if not all, currently known antibiotics. In countries like the USA, this health emergency is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths every year and for hundreds of thousands of sick individuals. Antibiotic resistance takes place in hospitals, where patients, doctors and nurses are in the midst of a planetary, environmental issue and is it this group to whom blame is often erroneously attributed. The real causes are in fact an entanglement of environmental factors that derive from the commodification of territories occupied by petrochemical refineries, livestock farming, and intensive agriculture, all of which is enhanced by supply chain systems. In the New Orleans area, both the environmental degradation and major social issues are a product of the scale of industrial programs that directly impact individuals and communities. As described by John W. Day and colleagues, since the 1930s the Mississippi River Delta: has been profoundly altered by humans with respect to hydrology, sediment supply, sea-level rise, ecology, and land use that directly affect sustainability, especially in the context of global change forcings [\u2026] and is in the process of a physical, ecological, and societal collapse.John W.

                "text": "In the Mississippi River Delta, antibiotic resistance is entangled with the ecological disruption elicited by the intensive activities of the petrochemical industry. The CDC, the U.S. Center for Disease Control Prevention, contains antibiotic resistance in Louisiana and other states through constant monitoring of its trends by asking hospitals to run a yearly antibiogram, which is a summary of the most important antibiotic resistance patterns for individual hospitals for the past year.\u201cState-based HAI prevention, Louisiana.\u201d\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 26 July 2019: cdc.gov/hai/stateplans/state-hai-plans/la.html.https://www.cdc.gov/hai/stateplans/state-hai-plans/la.html The scientific literature about the environmental causes of antibiotic resistance in Louisiana is, not surprisingly, in short supply. The first (above-mentioned) study to analyze the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in waters of southeast Louisiana dates back to 2018.Cameron Bedling and Raj Boopathy, \u201cPresence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in coastal recreational waters of southeast Louisiana, USA,\u201d Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology-Aqua, vol. 67, no. 8 (2018): pp. 800\u2013809. One reason for this lack of scientific studies on antibiotic resistance is the challenge posed by putting together phenomena spanning across different time scales. In ten hours, a small colony of one million bacteria can produce around three hundred genetic mutations. At a different temporal scale, the selective pressure of the industry that elicits bacterial mutations has been taking place for the past hundred years or so, beginning when the first products of oil refineries were introduced in the environment. This intertwining of different bacterial and industrial rhythms causes an exponential leap, one in which millions of bacterial mutations foment the planetary emergency of antibiotic resistance, which slowly kills many hundreds of thousands of people every year\u2014without even counting those living in the Global South who are not represented by censuses undertaken by international organizations. An additional difficulty arises from the fact that the causes of antibiotic resistance are typically rooted in activities whose dynamics follow non-linear pathways with downstream flows that are difficult to unravel. Moreover, grassroots movements, which often push public institutions and regulatory agencies to consider and address issues of public health in Louisiana are focused on other major health threats. For example, grassroots movements such as Cancer Alley, the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN), and the Concerned Citizens of St. John concentrate their forces upon negotiating with public institutions, experts, and petrochemical corporations about the environmental, geographically circumscribed conditions causing many individuals in the region to develop cancer, asthma and other health issues. Antibiotic resistance in the New Orleans area and southeast Louisiana is in fact a geographically dispersed process that concerns some 3,700 kilometers of river and multiple sites of origins. Even if antibiotic resistance is mainly recorded in hospitals, its roots lie in several locations, some of them thousands of kilometers away from the problem\u2019s acme. Therefore, the geographically situated dimension of pollutants that cause the ill health of local communities and which shape the identity and practices of grassroots movements, gets lost in the geographically scattered dimension of antibiotic resistance. The long journey of the Mississippi River is a major challenge when attempting to track and control causes of antibiotic resistance, as in its course it gathers the chemical outputs of ten states, which then end up in the dead zone of the Mississippi River Delta\u2014where the superbugs flourish. In the short and medium-term, the endeavors of biomedical research and its translation (from lab bench to bedside) represent an effective, biomedical form of help for patients infected by antibiotic-resistant bacteria\u2014through the discovery of new antibiotics, for instance. However, bacterial dynamics are so fast and ineffable that both precise prediction and interventions against bacterial resistance are doomed to failure. To put it another way: in the long run, industrial pollution needs to be considered as a factor that will always elicit the resistance of bacteria. A worthy social, scientific and political challenge to seriously consider the historical and biological trajectories of antibiotic resistance therefore requires an appreciation of bacterial dynamics as key, elemental processes necessary for the flourishing of all individuals and communities of animals and plants and that, at the same time, constrain human societies to both nature and industrial development. This is a challenge that calls for a change of political and scientific regimes of blind industrialization, demanding that they instead consider nature as partner.",

They divide, limit, control, and order the lives of humans and animals alike. The wooden fences of this southern region, built using local techniques and materials, not only mark the boundaries of property, humans, and animals, but also the border between Chile and Argentina. To \u201cjump the fence\u201d has more than one connotation: Fences To carry out the tasks, you need to have some basic facilities that allow you to stop, herd, shelter, measure, control and feed livestock. These constructs are known by the name of fences. In areas with a shortage of wood wire fences predominate, built with wooden posts and wire strands between them. They parcel land and demarcate the boundaries of property, and they also function as a border with Argentina.Leonel Galindo, Ais\u00e9n Voices and Customs. Santiago: Ediciones Or\u00edgenes, 2001.",

The artist, like a contemporary archaeologist, traced the path of the material culture along the territory. Over the past two years, Holzapfel has visited Patagonia a number of times, working with local carpenters and learning construction techniques, from the axe to sawmilling. By approaching the territory as a community, a living archive, a code to be deciphered, his art has enabled an understanding of history beyond the official narratives.

Indigenous communities had neither fences marking private property nor nations in the Western sense. Their houses were temporary tents. When Magellan sighted these lands for the first time in 1520, he saw \u201cnothing but footprints.\u201d Because of their large feet covered by guanaco skins, Magellan referred to the Tehuelches as \u201cPatagones\u201d (big feet), a name that has been used since then for the entire region. Rather than enjoying a peaceful coexistence, the indigenous people were displaced from the territory, threatened by civilization and large livestock enterprises, as Alberto Maria de Agostini wrote in 1945: Today civilization, with all its modern improvements, has rapidly invaded the vast Patagonian plains, populating them with thousands of sheep, laying roads, and building farms and villages, it is hard to remember that these same plains, a few decades ago, belonged entirely to those famous giant indigenous peoples [Tehuelches].Alberto Mar\u00eda de Agostini, Andes Patag\u00f3nicos: Viajes de Exploraci\u00f3n a la Cordillera Patag\u00f3nica Austral. Buenos Aires: Tall. Gr\u00e1f de G. Kraft, 1945, p. 377. Modern fences have been imposed over the indigenous footprints over the course of the twentieth century, while, paradoxically, the name of the region, derived from the language of the indigenous people, has remained. Currently, Patagonia is promoted as a pristine and immutable landscape in the tourist discourse. The artwork \u201cHaving a Gate\u201d by Holzapfel challenges this assumption. By reproducing a fence, the human intervention in the territory reveals itself, bringing recognition to the disenfranchisement of indigenous people. The landscape is no longer merely natural. It is a cultural and contested space, alerting us to one of the major questions of the Anthropocene, the now obsolete difference between nature and culture.",

Our destination is Scienceworks in the Melbourne suburb of Spotswood; our goal for the day is to see what we can learn from the museum\u2019s collection about the world we live in now, and (more concerning) turn it into a performance to be delivered at a \u201cslam event\u201d in the evening. The field trip is occurring under the auspices of the Anthropocene Campus Melbourne, a four-day conference of anthropologists, scientists, artists and other scholars hosted by Deakin University. As the name suggests, the event focuses on the idea of the Anthropocene, the proposed new epoch in Earth\u2019s history in which people \u2013 through burning fossil fuels and rapaciously upending ecosystems, as well as through sheer weight of numbers \u2013 have become a dominant planetary force. As the world warms, it will undergo a phase change: like water molecules falling out of their crystalline patterns in a melting iceblock, everything we know will shift and rearrange itself. Flows of air and water will wander, rainfall will migrate, seas will rise, cyclones will range further from the equator, old ways of living will become impossible, and habitats and societies will transform and collapse. \u201cWe thought we could control the environment, but our tools have turned against us,\u201d says Tim Neale, the anthropologist who organised the conference. \u201cSo the idea is to use this as a moment to reflect on what kinds of knowledge we need to get us out of this crisis.\u201d Geologists are still wrangling over the technical formulation of the Anthropocene \u2013 when exactly it began, how it fits in the deep time of Earth\u2019s past \u2013 but the notion that we live now in a human-haunted world has been a fruitful one for thinkers of all stripes. In the Maxi Taxi, for instance, are Thao Phan, who studies artificial intelligence and gender; Jacina Leong, an artist-curator \u201cexploring experiments in transdisciplinary curation\u201d; me, a tag-along science journalist; and Marita Dyson, our guide and a history and technology collection manager at Museums Victoria. As we make our way to Scienceworks, Dyson talks us through the history of the wetlands over which Melbourne is built. The museum itself stands \u201cwhere all the sewers drain to\u201d: on the site of the pumping station that for decades pushed the city\u2019s human excreta westward to the treatment plant at Werribee. Soon after arriving at Scienceworks we are taken behind the scenes to the museum\u2019s cavernous collection space. Here are defunct steam engines, electric cars that never were, and the original Tattslotto machine stored beside a crudely humanoid robot named Robbie. One shelf is reminiscent of those cartoons that show an ape evolving, step by step, into a modern human, only for Apple computers: natural selection steadily refining the primordial beige slab of the Apple II into the upright Macintosh and then the streamlined, gem-toned iMac G3. When it comes time to draw a theme from our tour, what emerges is waste: biological waste, technological waste, the disposable nitrile gloves used to handle objects in the collection, the fly droppings that build up on display items, the distressingly large pile of packaging left over after we\u2019ve eaten lunch \u2026 Perhaps the near-cosmic abstraction of the Anthropocene really comes down to the earthy question of waste and what is to be done with it. Call it the Anthropoocene, Phan quips. Shit too is made of stardust.",

                "text": "At the end of the Scienceworks tour we head back to the main Melbourne Museum in Carlton and reunite with the half dozen groups who have wandered through other parts of Museums Victoria\u2019s collection. Tasked with producing a 10-minute performance for the slam event, everyone has responded differently: one group delivers a story for children from a future without birds; another recites an ominous countdown through history to the moment of the Trinity atomic bomb test. One group doesn\u2019t want to get up on stage, and instead shows an astonishing short animated film about bee colony collapse they had somehow produced during the day. For our group\u2019s performance, Leong has drawn on her curatorial experience to produce elegant slides that pair invented object labels with photos of select items. As these are shown, we recite entries from an imagined museum catalogue. The four-day conference itself has been a light-speed mix of lectures, workshops and conversations, stories and ideas and new angles of vision. One minute you might be reading about the secret history of schemes to tow icebergs from Antarctica to irrigate the outback. Before you know it you\u2019re hearing a theory that ties together human evolution (\u201ceveryone knows \u2018out of Africa\u2019 is nonsense\u201d) with Amazonian earth mounds and heterodox climate science. This is followed by a talk from Wurundjeri elder Uncle Dave Wandin, who is trying to revive Indigenous fire-based land management in Victoria. All this in an ultramodern tower complex with views to the CBD across the construction sites of the Docklands. Far below, dwarfed by cranes, you can make out a 25-metre statue of Bunjil, the eagle creator spirit of the Kulin nation. Themes emerge and recur over the days: the interrogation of objects and artefacts for their function and connections and history (in one workshop, an interrogation of a windproof match almost sets off the smoke detectors before it is dunked in a cup of tea); decolonisation, since Anthropocene problems arise most of all from the ways of living pioneered by Europeans and imposed on the rest of the world over the past few centuries; ending the idea of any real separation between human and other; and feminist philosopher Donna Haraway\u2019s idea of \u201cstaying with the trouble\u201d \u2013 less solving problems or re-establishing normality, more \u201cliving and dying together on a damaged Earth\u201d. After the conference, the enormous technical, social and political problems that we face in the coming decades and centuries still remain. Carbon emissions must still somehow be checked, mass extinctions still loom, and global inequality and injustice are still rampant. But connections have been made, and perspectives have been changed. If humans are a geological force, then human minds are as good a place as any to start intervening in planetary affairs. The moment that sticks is the American sociologist Hannah Landecker\u2019s response to a question asked one evening about microbes\u2019 ability to adapt at the molecular level to changed environments: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to use that as a source of hope, if you like.\u201d",

        "abstract": "In this reflection upon experiences in Natchez, Mississippi as part of the Anthropocene River Journey, Jason Ludwig, whose research explores racial capitalism and environmental injustice, describes how the town\u2019s Black history\u2014for so long suppressed in favor of an antebellum heritage tourism economy\u2014has been asserted through the efforts of local activists. It is only through paying attention to these histories, he argues, that the intersecting Anthropoenic relations of extraction, enslavement, and inequality are revealed. Here, Ludwig puts forward what Clyde Woods has termed a \u201cblues epistemology\u201d as a means of establishing the critical historical consciousness crucial for determining more just futures in the Anthropocene.",

                "text": "I: The View from Natchez When I visit huge mansions I run around to the back, looking for the house behind the house behind the Big house where my origins begin in this Republic. \u2014 Sterling D Plumpp Sterling D Plumpp, \u201c In a Natchez Cemetery I\u2026,\u201d excerpted in Clyde Woods, Development Arrested: the Blues and Plantation Power in the Mississippi Delta (London: Verso, 2017). \u201cNatchez was and is a segregated town,\u201d explained Jeremy Houston, a local tour guide and historian. This Mississippi city with a population of around 15,000 is also an unusual starting point for any effort to conceptualize the Anthropocene. Compared to the dramatic scenes of resource extraction usually associated with this term, Natchez is a slow and quiet place\u2014seemingly far adrift from the global march of unmitigated extractivism that has harbored climactic and geological catastrophe on a planetary scale. Nevertheless, as Jeremy led our group of curious students, artists, and researchers through the town in October 2019, I found myself wondering: what exactly, then, can Natchez teach us about the Anthropocene? Although once home to thriving paper mills and rubber plants, Natchez has since been left behind by an industrial economy that has sought cheaper labor abroad. Today the city depends for most of its money on a tourist industry that encourages visitors to spend day (and night) on grounds once worked by enslaved people. The city\u2019s verdant meadows are dotted with grand manors sporting equally grand names like Longwood or Rosalie Mansion, former cotton plantations, and homes of cotton planters that have been converted into museums or bed and breakfast inns. These all aim to display to visitors to the city the wealth and opulence that once belonged to its antebellum, slave-owning elite. In Natchez today, tourists are invited to not only eat dinner on tables once owned by those who made their fortune in the trade of other human beings, but also\u2014 if one is so inclined\u2014to take \u201chaunted\u201d Halloween tours through their plantation grounds, their bedrooms, and even the cellars of their mansions \u00a0(although visitors are left to imagine for themselves the identities of the tattered and tortured ghosts who might be stalking the halls of the master\u2019s house). If the concept of the Anthropocene points our attentions to the future, Natchez on the other hand feels like a town designed to send visitors on a trip back through time. But as Jeremy was at pains to point out, the image of the past that the average tourist receives is an incomplete one. While Antebellum Natchez certainly was one of the country\u2019s wealthiest cities, its grandeur and wealth was produced by the labor of enslaved people\u2014none of whom could enjoy the benefits of these riches. Theirs is the history you will not receive while staying at a bed and breakfast, Jeremy explained. And that is why he and other Black residents have taken it upon themselves to tell the other half of the city\u2019s history\u2014the story of its Black past. They have invested many years labor into doing so, erecting several placards and monuments throughout the city, marking sites of importance to the history of Black Natchez. These include slave markets, blues clubs, and the homes and business places of post-emancipation Black community leaders and civil rights activists. Jeremy himself has played a prominent role in recovering this long-ignored past, publishing a multi volume history of Black Natchez, working as a docent at the city\u2019s African-American History Museum (opened in 1991), and founding his own historic tour company. Sterling D Plumpp, \u201c In a Natchez Cemetery I\u2026,\u201d excerpted in Clyde Woods, Development Arrested: the Blues and Plantation Power in the Mississippi Delta (London: Verso, 2017). The institutionalization of Black history in Natchez has only been possible thanks to long battles fought by local activists. The memorialization of the Forks of the Roads slave market is a case in point. The market, located at what was once a busy intersection along the city\u2019s eastern border, was founded in 1808 by the slave traders Isaac Franklin and John Armfield. Until 1845 it was a principal trading post in the global exchange of human bodies, with thousands of enslaved Africans and their descendants marched out on display under the brutal Mississippi sun, to be gazed upon by prospective buyers as well as a curious public. At its peak, around 500 enslaved persons were sold per day at Fork of the Roads, making it the largest Southern slave market outside of New Orleans. Such prodigious commercial activity was fueled by a developmentalist ideology that tied the economic growth of Natchez and the surrounding region to the expansion of the plantation economy as well as to the brutal bondage and exchange of enslaved bodies undergirding it. Its chief slogan\u2014which made today\u2019s thriving plantation tourist economy possible\u2014is captured in an old advertisement for the Forks of the Roads market (reproduced in facsimile on one of placards that stands at the site today): \u201cBuy More Negroes to Raise More Cotton to Buy More Negroes.\u201d And so on and so forth.",

                "text": "Despite this history, the grounds where the Forks of the Road market once stood remained empty of any historical markers until 1998 when local community members campaigned to memorialize the site. After a protruded battle with city leaders, who were worried that such actions might taint the city\u2019s reputation as the civilized and aristocratic \u201cJewel of the Mississippi\u201d (which, they feared, would harm the tourist industry), the campaign succeeded, leading to the erection of placards that narrate the history of Forks of Road. Today, visitors to the site will find on display iron chains that once held enslaved people waiting to be sold into the brutal economy of Mississippi\u2019s cotton kingdom. That this history remained silenced for so long is all the more egregious considering its relevance to present day concerns. With his profits from slave-trading at the market, Isaac Franklin started his own cotton plantation in nearby Baton Rouge in the 1830s. Displaying a cruel and sardonic wit, he named it after the country from which he had imported most of his enslaved workforce: Angola. Nearly two hundred years later and in its current guise as the largest and most notorious maximum-security prison in the United States, Louisiana State Penitentiary, the Angola Plantation continues to operate as a site geared towards extracting maximum value from Black bodies in bondage. That such connections to the past remained for so long hidden from public memory is no mere accident. Nor is it surprising. A plethora of scholars have shown how, like murderers hiding the bodies of their victims, dominant institutions expunge the histories of violence that enabled their ascension in order to cover their hegemony under a veil of normalcy.Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 2015). In Natchez, the image of the city presented by the tourist industry depends to a large extent upon such silencing of the past. As the work done by Jeremy and others who have sought to recover the history of Black Natchez shows, however, marginalized groups can and will contest the monopolization of historical narration. The lessons this offers towards understanding the dynamics of the Anthropocene is that just like fossil fuels, just like cotton, just like tourism, history has a political economy too. And just as rethinking and reshaping our dependency on oil and coal is crucial for building a more livable future in the Anthropocene, it is also vital that we develop new forms of critical historical consciousness and institutions of public memory that place the injustices of the past on trial. Such work, which Jeremy and others in Natchez have long been engaged in, is an ineliminable step towards building a more just world. As the poet and native Mississippian Natasha Trethewey has written, confronting the challenges of the future means first \u201creckoning with our own blindness and erasures.\u201d Natasha D. Trethewey, Beyond Katrina: A Meditation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2015). Put another way, reckoning with the Anthropocene requires not mistaking huge mansions to be our history, and searching instead for the stories hidden away in the house behind the house behind the Big House. II: Singing the Blues in the Anthropocene One scholar whose life work equated to just such a colossal effort to uncover lost Black histories is Clyde Woods. In his writings on the history of the Mississippi Delta, Woods argued that the alluvial soils of the region gave birth not only to the logics of domination that justified the racial violence and ecological exploitation still prevalent in the United States today, but also to the most cogent forms of critique and resistance\u2014what he named the \u201cblues epistemology.\u201d Woods describes the blues epistemology as a Black intellectual tradition vested in collective deconstruction of the \u201cplantation relations\u201d that first destroyed Black identities and aspirations during enslavement, and which have continued doing over 150 years after emancipation. As a mode of knowing and expressing anguish at the Black past, indicting the injustices of the present, and imagining and building towards a more just future, the blues epistemology can be understood as oriented around social and personal investigation of two critical questions: \u201cHow did we get to where we are now\u201d and \u201cHow do we get to where we want to be?\u201d And as those preserving the history of Black Natchez have shown, the blues epistemology and the forms of survival and resistance it has engendered have always been present in the city and the surrounding region. Its presence can be felt today in the Natchez African-American Museum, where one can read the stories of the formerly enslaved who sought to build new lives for themselves while caught within a freedom that was not truly free; or about the musicians and writers, from Papa Lightfoot and Richard Wright to Anne Moody and the Ealey Brothers, who sought melodic and literary languages with which to express blues wisdoms; or even about Wharlest Jackson, whose life was stolen by a car bomb because he dared to speak up and fight for Black equality. Their stories all attest to the fact that as long as plantations have stood in Natchez, there have been voices courageous enough to indict the violence and exploitation that they stand for.",

                "text": "These voices must be amplified and their insights must inform every conversation concerning the Anthropocene. If the term \u201cAnthropocene\u201d conjures up apocalyptic images of ecological catastrophe, mass precarity, and the fragility of human life, then which other voices can guide our thinking about these issues other than those who have for generations engaged in critique and resistance against systems of violence and exploitation? Woods expresses this idea perfectly,Clyde Woods, Development Arrested: the Blues and Plantation Power in the Mississippi Delta (London: Verso, 2017), p. 290. stating that future political and economic movements must take strides to celebrate and valorize the millions up upon millions, living and dead who met the regimes of destruction with unshakeable dignity. In the same vein, the lands, rivers, streams, air, plants and animals of the region must be restored to their sacred status. Until then, \u2018every hill and molehill,\u2019 every blade of grass, every flutter of the flag, and every note that is played must be contested. From the viewpoint Woods offers us, the Mississippi Delta and its surrounding areas emerge as pre-eminent sites for understanding the historical forces that have shaped the Anthropocene. The blues epistemology offers the conceptual means for comprehending how this region never truly was the heart of an \u201cempire of liberty,\u201d as Thomas Jefferson once dreamed of it, but was instead the epicenter of the nightmare that was American slaveocracy. Thinking the blues in the Anthropocene means attending to the history that tracks the expropriation of territories along the Mississippi, from Native populations and the radical reshaping of these lands into an ever-expanding regime aimed at extracting maximum value from land and from brutalized Black bodies. The tendrils of this regime stretched far beyond the banks of the river, its cotton, and capital traveling across the Atlantic to fuel the industrial economies that European powers would later apply towards colonizing much of the globe.Sven Beckert, Empire of Cotton: A Global History, (Vintage, 2015); Walter Johnson, River of Dark Dreams: Slavery and Empire in the Cotton Kingdom, (Harvard University Press, 2017); Eric Williams, Capitalism and Slavery, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1994). Seen from the blues perspective, then, the plantations standing along the Mississippi River represent the foundations of the modern hierarchical world-system, and signify the violences that announced entry into the Anthropocene. Only once the constitutive role that these historical violences against nature and people played in the development of the modern world is acknowledged can the important work of constructing more livable futures begin in earnest. This is the foundational truth to which the blues epistemology has always attested. The pantheon of blues thinkers enumerated by Woods\u2014and indeed, Woods himself\u2014demonstrate an express commitment to developing a new social order centered on the liberation of subjugated lands and people. No figure expresses this ideal better than Fannie Lou Hamer, who founded the Freedom Farm Cooperative in Sunflower County, Mississippi in 1969. Believing that true freedom would remain unattainable for the Delta\u2019s Black population so long as wealthy white planters monopolized land, Hamer started the farms in order to promote Black self-reliance in the region. For Hamer, the Freedom Farms expressed her philosophy that land should be communally-owned and that Black survival in Mississippi depended on seeking the necessary means for \u201cchanneling legitimate discontent into creative and progressive action for change,\u201d whether it be through practicing sustainable agricultural or organizing political movements.Fannie Lou Hamer, \u201cIf the Name of the Game Is Survive, Survive,\u201d Speech Delivered in Ruleville, Mississippi, September 27, 1971, cited in Woods, Development Arrested. To this end, the Freedom Farms produced food intended to feed Mississippi\u2019s impoverished and struggling Black families, while also offering affordable housing, educational opportunities, and various other services. Although a lack of funding meant that the Freedom Farms were short-lived, such an experiment in envisioning and enacting a more socially and ecologically just world is instructive for our present moment, which is plagued as much by social injustice as by looming environmental catastrophe. Indeed, Hamer\u2019s work at the Freedom Farms has continued to serve as touchstone and guidance for those concerned with sustaining Black life amidst the future challenges presented by the Anthropocene. III: Black and Blues Futures Like Jeremy fighting to uncover the past of Black Natchez, others in Mississippi are reclaiming the legacy of Fannie Lou Hamer and the blues tradition in their efforts to develop a more liberatory Black future. The relevance of the blues epistemology to conceptualizations of the Anthropocene is most apparent in Mississippi\u2019s capital, Jackson. In the \u201cCity with Soul,\u201d Cooperation Jackson is organizing Black and Latino working-class communities towards building an environmentally sustainable, worker-owned cooperative. So far, this consists of the Freedom Farms (named after Hamer\u2019s cooperative), community maker-spaces, and a land trust upon which efforts are underway to develop worker-owned businesses and housing. Across these sites, the group seeks to develop the institutions and infrastructures necessary to sustain Black life in the face of the planetary devastation threatened by the Anthropocene. This work draws heavily on the inspiration of previous generations of Black radical thinkers and activists, ranging from Hamer to Kuwasi Balagoon, the radical Black poet and anarchist. The Cooperative\u2019s current work also builds upon the legacy of the Jackson-Kush Plan, a generations-old Black re-imagining of the city of Jackson and the Mississippi River Valley that envisions the region as a catalyst for a sweeping transformation the living conditions of Black Americans. The plan envisions the creation of a Black-led New Afrikan Republic in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee that models itself after the Ancient Egyptian Kushite Civilization, with the Mississippi River serving as the fertile analog to the Nile. Through their work, which blends Mississippi\u2019s long tradition of Black critical thought with expertise in twenty-first century digital tools, Cooperation Jackson applies the blues epistemology towards developing what the historian Rayvon Fouch\u00e9 has described as a \u201cblack politics of technology,\u201d a radical reshaping of technological processes in a manner responsive to Black needs. The result is in a broad vision of what radical Black future-making in the Anthropocene might look like.Rayvon Fouch\u00e9, \u201cThe Wretched of the Gulf: Racism, Technological Dramas, and Black Politics of Technology,\u201d The Black Scholar 36, no. 4 (December 1, 2006): 7\u201312. The cooperative\u2019s work is foremost concerned with addressing the resource deprivation that is a direct legacy of the ecological devastation and underdevelopment wrought by the plantation economy on Mississippi\u2019s landscape. Kali Akuno, one of Cooperation Jackson\u2019s founders, has written that the history of Mississippi\u2019s development \u201chas fundamentally been contingent upon the extraction of natural resources such as timber\u2026 and cash crop agriculture, such as cotton, tobacco, sugarcane and rice, which were primarily sold as international commodities.\u201dKali Akuno, \u201cBuild and Fight: The Program and Strategy of Cooperation Jackson,\u201d in Jackson Rising: The Struggle for Economic Democracy and Black Self-Determination in Jackson, Mississippi, ed. Kali Akuno and Ajamu Nangwaya (Daraja Press, 2017). However, with the nineteenth-century transition from a global capitalist system structured around agricultural commodities to one structured around fossil fuels, formerly monocultural economies like Mississippi, lacking the capital and infrastructural networks of more economically-advanced regions in the United States, have since been locked into a state of resource scarcity and underdevelopment. \u200bThe burdens of this underdevelopment have largely been fallen onto Mississippi\u2019s Black population. Despite the abundance of food across the United States and of agricultural land in Mississippi itself, working-class and impoverished Black populations in the state face a variety of food-access deprivations. This food scarcity, an ongoing legacy of the plantation economy, has left Black communities in Jackson and the surrounding region with little to no access to fresh and healthy foods. Addressing this racially-stratified scarcity motivates Cooperation Jackson\u2019s work, which applies new and sustainable technologies towards continuing Hamer\u2019s efforts to advance black food sovereignty in the region. Their plans to achieve this include the creation of an Eco-village in the heart of the Downton Gateway section of West Jackson\u2014a \u201ccomprehensive, interconnected and interdependent supply and value chains\u2026our own network of cooperative farms, processing centers, food hubs, compost and soil generators, food processors, canneries, grocery stores, etc.\u201dAkuno, \u201cBuild and Fight: The Program and Strategy of Cooperation Jackson.\u201d The cooperative seeks to further develop Black resource sovereignty by building the material and infrastructure for the Eco-village with tools created in their Centers for Community Production\u2014maker-spaces that use open source sharing and 3D printing in order to develop sustainable, worker-controlled manufacturing. Through work like this, Cooperation Jackson contributes a black radical vision of technoscientific practice in the Anthropocene that imagines possibilities extending far beyond the visions of global \u201csustainable development\u201d discourse, showing how new tools can be used not just to improve profit margins while cutting carbon emissions, but in order to catalyze the democratization of the economy, the transition to a sustainable economy, and the empowerment of vulnerable Black communities. Like Hamer\u2019s Freedom Farms, Cooperation Jackson\u2019s work is as much about feeding impoverished Black Mississippians as it is about seeking out and enacting a more just world. Such undertakings locate the Anthropocenic task of reshaping of our relations with the natural world as inextricably intertwined with the need to address and undo the legacies of centuries of racist violence. As Sister Imani Bridgeet Olugbala of the cooperative has put it: \u201cplanting a seed can be a revolutionary act.\u201d Through following this insight and earnestly engaging with histories of violence, as well as those of Black resistance, perhaps we can plant the seeds necessary to sustain and cultivate more just and ethical forms of life in the Anthropocene.",

In a sense, the piano is alive and continues to be, even in this state of distress. How much more force can we put into containing the wood? The wood sounds wretched and defiant.

After the End of the World In their closing keynote on \u2018transmutation of the elements, radioactive refugeeism, and alchemical wanderings\u2019, Karen Barad re/turns us to our inherited futures passed. Frustrated with the doings of their beloved physics, Barad set out to retrace the legacies of Nuclear Physics in its smallest bits, to reunite it with meaning again. I find myself folded forward to try to take in more of Barad\u2019s artful primer on Theoretical Physics and Quantum Field Theory. Barad is carefully pulling physics through itself to dismantle the idea of the discrete divisions that separate a past and present, here and there, other and self. Central to Newtonian physics, is the idea of the void: a background against which matter takes its place. The void does not have matter/doesn\u2019t matter. This, Barad says, is the logic at the heart of occupation and the expansion of empire. It is an act of a/voidance of the human and the non-human and of relations, times, histories, possibilities in a place, that makes for conquest and Colonialism, or, as they explored in their talk, the rendering of an island as the test-site for nuclear warfare. But as Quantum Field Theory has it, the void is always in motion, filled with infinite virtual im/possibilities of life, death, being, non-being, time and matter. A virtual particle can emerge into being/life when energy is put into the void, and can slip back into non-being, emitting that energy. Barad shows us how, in the heart of the void, the emotional life of a \u2018self-touching electron\u2019 in a vacuum of infinities queers any notion of continuity, and unhinges matters of time and space. There is laughter in the room when they read a quote from Richard Feynman, who expresses horror at the perverse life of the electron and proposes his theory of Renormalization, dressing the deviance of the electron with the infinity of the void so that the particle can be captured in time and space. They call this \u201cthe electron in dragBarad, Karen. \u201cAfter the End of the World: Transmutation of the Elements, Radioactive Refugeeism, and Alchemical Wanderings.\u201d Keynote Lecture, Anthropocene Campus Melbourne, Melbourne, 6 September 2018.. Inside the void, all possible histories are im/possible at the same time. The room is charged. Pockets, like the vacuums of Quantum Field Theory, are spaces in suspended time where events and matterings surface into existence given the required energy. The campus was an activating moment that stretched over four days, where potential and possibility multiplied as we entered and left rooms, sounded and listened, turned, attuned, returned and remembered. The force created with the bodies and thoughts at the Anthropocene Campus Melbourne and its various pockets, propel attunements towards movements, and sensing towards knowing. Here, a community of care was cultivated through communal dis/orientation around the unscripted contingencies and irreversibilities of the Anthropocene.",

How humanity inadvertently shifted the whole planet so radically and in such a self-damaging manner is now the subject of intense debate. Different narratives of blame locate relative responsibility with various sectors, activities and groups. Common candidates include farming, colonial plantations, industrialization and urbanisation, and the post-war acceleration in consumption and pollution. From a material perspective, there is a strong geological rationale for naming each as a major source of planetary-scale environmental and social impacts and \u201cterraforming.\u201d Indeed, this is how these various proposed starting dates for the Anthropocene have been identified: through the pursuit of widespread and sharp enough changes in the geological record to count as what geologists call a \u201cGolden Spike\u201d, the prerequisite for declaring a new epoch. Yet this search for the physical origins of the Anthropocene in the historical record needs to extend far past physical signals and their proximate causes to the visions, goals and assumptions underlying the activities involved, including what Ian Hacking would call styles of reasoning. Reading the Anthropocene in this light reveals many limitations within the outlooks, ideas and values that informed the activities mentioned above, including an often willful ignorance of the immediate impacts on people, nonhumans and the abiotic environment, as well as the \u201cunknown unknown\u201d of the long-term, accumulative changes being wrought. In combing history for the sources of our present problems, it is easy to lament past generations\u2019 failure to care about the future. Yet their ignorance of future effects should not be conflated with a disinterest in the future per se. In fact, past fixations with and assumptions about the future were core to the problematic styles of thought that enabled Anthropocene-inducing actions. Some of the proposed start dates for the Anthropocene are notable not just for the physical changes they mark, but for the ideas about the future with which they were associated. In the remainder of this essay, I consider three of them. The earliest of the three is an increasingly prominent origin date for the Anthropocene: the beginning of the Colonial era, when certain Europeans began their Earth-changing project of finding, appropriating and exploiting lands, natures, and peoples across the planet. This \u201corganizational transition,\u201d as Simon Lewis and Mark Maslin call it, was essentially about creating a globalized economy. As they put it, \u201cA new world order driven by the search for private profit was born.\u201d Key to this globalized economy was merchant capitalism: the distribution of products around the world via increasingly long transport routes involving ships. Conducting business through long, ocean-faring supply chains demanded a new comfort with uncertainty, notably a new and positive calculative attitude toward risk. The dangers of merchant capitalism meant that the successful \u201ccreation of profits depended on foresight and planning.\u201d This led to a new vision of time as &#8220;a commodity to be used, saved or sold to create profits, rather than something that was simply doled out by the creator&#8221;.",

Here, the shock of the wars, competing visions for what world should be rebuilt, and new computing technologies of the sort that eventually enabled the Anthropocene to be detected by Earth System Scientists, led to a different stance on the future. No longer was time understood as reliably linear or the future as single. Rather, a new profound uncertainty about what could happen led to a sense of the future as an array of multiple possibilities; a maze to be negotiated carefully, not just pursued blindly. Fittingly, the computer power that enabled this new stance on the future was a by-product of the atomic weapons program that led to the dropping of the world\u2018s first atomic bomb, a moment in July 1945 that is now proposed as a suitable Golden Spike for the Great Acceleration phase of the Anthropocene. In 1964, RAND Corporation scientists in the United States used the &#8220;massive data processing and interpreting capability that \u2026 created the breakthrough which led to the development of the atomic bomb&#8221; to produce a &#8220;general theory of prediction&#8221;, the aim of which was to &#8220;enable us to deal with socio-economic and political problems as confidently as we do with problems in physics and chemistry&#8221;. This &#8220;radical shift&#8221; in notions of the future \u2026 became known as \u201cforecasting\u201d\u2019. Forecasting is now ubiquitous, thanks in part to the radical uncertainty that the Anthropocene has ushered in. While consideration of the future is more important than ever, it is prudent to remember that the social origins of our assumptions about the future and the tools we use to perceive it are rooted in the very origins of the Anthropocene. Thus, how suitable they are for helping us understand and navigate the Anthropocene is open to debate. One group that contests the implicit determinism of futurists and their forecasts are futurologists, who argue instead for both a greater degree of openness to unexpected possibilities, and for a commitment to actively and inclusively choosing desirable futures. Many commentators of the Anthropocene similarly call for greater reflexivity about what futures humanity as a whole is now creating, knowingly or not. With the future recast in this way as less a territory to map and claim, and more a path to be carefully and painstakingly created, we may be witnessing yet another stance on the future emerging, one more attuned to the blind spots and responsibilities involved.",

What concerned city planners and developers in the 1990s was that industry\u2019s \u201cretreat\u201d would mean substantial landholdings along the river\u2019s edge being vacated, leaving new spaces from which the city could conjure its postindustrial future.For more on deindustrialization along the river\u2019s shores in the Twin Cities see: Nunnally, Patrick, \u201cMapping the \u2018Retreat of the Industrial Glacier,\u2019\u201d River Life (May 21, 2019): https://riverlife.umn.edu/rivertalk/21may2019 The \u201cdevelopment framework\u201d detailed by the report includes a combination of environmental and infrastructural improvements aimed at giving the city of St. Paul a \u201ccompetitive advantage in an increasingly globalized world.\u201d The \u201cnew spirit\u201d of the city projected by Mayor Coleman, then, was one that fully integrated the Mississippi into the urban fabric of St. Paul, understanding it as a crucial amenity for urban life and a propeller of economic development in a postindustrial era. St. Paul\u2014like cities across the US wrestling with deindustrialization\u2014had been developing plans for \u201curban revitalization\u201d along its waterfront since the 1980s, commissioning the Riverfront Development Corporation in 1984 to connect public assets with private interests to oversee investment along the Mississippi. In what might be seen as the culmination of the city\u2019s efforts over the past 40 years, the Riversedge development, approved by the Ramsey County Board in July of 2019, completes St. Paul\u2019s postindustrial makeover. Composed of four towering glass structures, like those on the waterfronts of cities from Singapore to Miami, the 788-million US dollars Riversedge project includes a luxury hotel, condos, and apartments, one million square feet of Class A office space, and a public walkway that connects them to the river. Riversedge will be constructed atop land owned by the city, formerly home to West Publishing Company headquarters and printing facilities, refrigerated storage, and a county jail. The project was proposed by AECOM, a multinational engineering and architectural firm that has worked on a number of high-profile projects, including the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the World Trade Center, Dubai Health Care City, and numerous international airports. AECOM is asking for $80 million from the city to subsidize the project, which Ramsey County hopes to partially cover through a $40 million State bonding bill. This is on top of the $11 million the city has already invested in anticipation of a large-scale development of the site, having demolished the existing remnants of industrial infrastructure in 2015 in order to attract developers.",

In Capital City, Samuel Stein argues that the deindustrialization of US cities has given rise to the \u201creal estate state\u201d in which \u201creal estate capital has inordinate influence over the shape of our cities, the parameters of our politics, and the lives we lead.\u201dSamuel Stein, Capital City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State. London: Verso, 2019, p. 5. With the decline of industrial capitalism, real estate development has become a primary economic driver in cities, dictating the terms through which space is organized and land use is determined. In the Twin Cities, the Mississippi\u2019s diminishing importance as an industrial river has given rise to a situation in which the river now serves as an amenity that augments the value of real estate capital. In this context, decisions made about the river\u2019s future as it flows through the Twin Cities are intimately wrapped up in considerations of the immense value of the land adjacent to it. Even positive social and ecological interventions that reimagine the postindustrial river often unwittingly dovetail with the interests of real estate capital and developers.For example, see Patrick Nunnally\u2019s essay about the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary In other words, deindustrialization is a process that is not necessarily about \u201cliberating\u201d the river but subjecting it to the new necessities of capital accumulation. Take, for example, the Upper Harbor Terminal (UHT) in Minneapolis: the longest contiguous stretch of real estate on the upper Mississippi, which served as the river\u2019s northernmost port until it closed in 2014. Located in the historically African American neighborhood of North Minneapolis, the UHT was built atop of the demolished homes of residents in the 1960s and has since barred the neighborhood access to the riverfront. Like the proposed site of the Riversedge development in St. Paul, the UHT sits on land owned by the city, and, like the St. Paul redevelopment, this land is being offered to the private sector to build for-profit developments, heavily subsidized by taxpayers. The proposed redevelopment of the UHT looks strikingly similar to the kinds of redevelopment projects that have been taking place in deindustrialized spaces across the US since the 1980s. Geographer David Harvey describes this process in the city of Baltimore, where throughout the 1960s deindustrialization and racial turmoil led to white flight and a declining tax base.David Harvey, \u201cA View from Federal Hill,\u201d in Elizabeth Fee, Linda Shopes, and Linda Zeidman (eds), The Baltimore Book: New Views of Local History. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1992. The city\u2019s solution to this crisis was to finance massive waterfront developments, such as the Inner Harbor Project, in order to attract capital back to the city center. Through bonding bills that served as giveaways to the finance and real estate industries, the developments created low-wage service jobs in place of the industry jobs that had been lost, whilst fueling the gentrification of historically African American neighborhoods.",

                "text": "This kind of neoliberal city management fueled the rise of the real estate state in the 1980s and 1990s, where public resources were given over to private developers to fulfill the promise of economic revitalization. The current redevelopment of the Minneapolis and St. Paul riverfronts follow strikingly similar patterns. The original proposal for the UHT redevelopment by United Properties and Thor Companies\u2014which included a \u201cdestination\u201d music amphitheater, a hotel, retail space, housing (the majority of which is market rate), and parkland\u2014was sold to the neighborhood and the city through the language of economic revitalization while simultaneously offering only low-wage, service-sector jobs to the already marginalized neighborhood in which it was planned. Against the backdrop of intense community pressure, before it was approved by the city council the developers offered some concessions, removing the hotel from the concept plan and adding a commitment to \u201ccommunity ownership models\u201d for some of the retail space. With the formation of a Community Planning and Engagement Committee, the developers and the city offered only a muted hope that the core issues of racial and environmental justice would be addressed as the redevelopment is pushed through. Already, property values around the site are spiking, accelerating the ongoing processes of speculation and displacement taking place in North Minneapolis. The story of the UHT reflects the ways that the river remains a site of extraction, where publicly held land is mined by the forces of financial speculation, and where city governments facilitate the flow of capital to and from these extractive spaces. Beneath the talk of \u201ceconomic revitalization\u201d and the boosterism of city officials lies a deep impotence of advocacy for a just social ecology and a feeble interest in mitigating the transfer of public wealth into private hands. These dynamics come into stark relief when we examine the Riversedge development in St. Paul. In a metropolitan area currently in the midst of one of the worst affordable housing crises in its history\u2014like many cities across the country in the grips of the real estate state\u2014the proposed Riversedge development in St. Paul contains no affordable housing units. Instead, AECOM has proposed to \u201cgive\u201d the city a paltry $5 million to be spent on affordable housing elsewhere (a mere fraction of the $80 million it is demanding from the city to build the project). Like with the UHT, small concessions are offered to appease the public while largely excluding it from the enormous wealth to be generated from this publicly owned land. While cities are desperate to increase their tax revenue through projects like Riversedge, as Harvey and many others point out, there is little evidence that public subsidies of real estate developments actually benefit everyday citizens. In its stark reproduction of economic and spatial inequality, Riversedge exemplifies the vision of the river as a site of consumption and luxury, where public access to and interaction with the river functions as an amenity that increases land values and land speculation. As it flows through the Twin Cities, the transformation of the Mississippi into a real estate river typifies the grip that real estate capital\u2014and the neoliberal civic-management strategies that facilitate it\u2014have on our collective imagination of the river\u2019s future. While civic leaders looked at the \u201cretreat of the industrial glacier\u201d with a sense of possibility at the close of the twentieth century, in the present we should approach any such enthusiasm with suspicion. As the industrial glacier retreats in places like Minneapolis and St. Paul, it leaves in its wake not a tabula rasa ready for new development, but deep layers of sedimented violence. Indeed, as we face the reality of actual glacial retreat and the possibility of the end of life on the planet as we know it, the deep wounds of colonial conquest and the industrial era confront us like never before. In the case of the Twin Cities and the Mississippi, the story of industrialization is inseparable from the expropriation of land from the Dakota people, their displacement and attempted genocide throughout the nineteenth century, and the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism today. Likewise, as the story of the UHT lays bare, the histories of racial violence and the displacement of African Americans, which have been constitutive of the industrial Mississippi since the time of slavery, still haunt it today. To say the Mississippi is an Anthropocene River, to emphasize human impact and to imagine its different futures, is also to contend with the colonial and racial violence that took place alongside the massive infrastructural interventions into the river\u2019s flow and its attendant ecological degradation. In significant ways, the retreat of the industrial glacier is not the harbinger of Mayor Coleman\u2019s imagined \u201cnew spirit\u201d; it marks not a break from extractive processes but a continuation of them. The real estate river projects onto the river and its shores employs a similar settler imagination to the one that shaped it at the beginning of the industrial era. By failing to truly confront the myriad violences of that era, it threatens to repeat them. How do we understand the river\u2019s value beyond that of an amenity for real estate capital or an entity that provides ecological or other \u201cservices\u201d to the public at large? How might the values of reconciliation and reparation drive our approach to the river\u2019s future? Whose voices should be foregrounded, including non-human actors? As we witness the intensive land grab currently taking place on the Mississippi\u2019s shores, let us form a radical imagination that looks beyond, and struggles against, the terms set by the real estate state.",

Three United States study sites were chosen for their pinelands, also known as pine barren ecosystems: one within a national forest in Florida; another within a state game land in North Carolina; and the last in an electrical utility company\u2019s power line area in New York. These sites varied greatly in the degree to which they were shielded from development and recreational use as well as in how they were managed in terms of ecosystem dynamics. Because pine barrens are sandy soil systems that are typically maintained by fire regimes, the nationally and state-regulated sites frequently conducted \u201ccontrolled burns\u201d to create something akin to the fire regimes that would otherwise occur naturally. However, because the US Army also used the state game-lands site for training purposes, unintentional fires sometimes occurred due to the use of artillery and weapons; likewise, spent ammunition littered the site. Managed forestry and logging were conducted at the publicly managed sites and I had to obtain national and state permits to collect ants there. The electrical utility company\u2019s site in New York allowed no fire maintenance and instead mowed and cut vegetation to maintain space for the power lines. Access to these sites was not permitted, so my research collection was conducted without seeking permission.",

An amateur ant expert, Ray Sanwald (Figure 1), was my local guide, as he has been for many international ant researchers looking to sample species native only to that locale. Ray has lived in this area of Long Island continuously for over seventy years. Over that time, his house lot, which had been at the far edge of agricultural land in the 1950s, in the intervening time has been engulfed by suburban development. While I certainly altered the landscape with my own ant collecting (digging as deep as two or three meters to obtain the ants and removing the colonies in the process), Ray had begun to actually collect and relocate ants to a two-acre plot of land near his house to create a biodiversity sanctuary for native ant species that were in danger of becoming extinct due to habitat loss. Ray\u2019s particular interest in \u201cslave-making\u201d ants and species of this group were of high priority for his singular conservation effort. He was very supportive and encouraging of my collecting because he saw my species as competitors to the slave-making ants that he was trying to preserve\u2014anything that aided their removal was a positive change in his eyes. There is no other person known to have the expertise Ray has with that local ant fauna, and this has implications for future study into the slave-making species, which are of great interest to a global group of researchers. Like the national and state forests, the Long Island Pine Barrens are garden versions of those that existed before. The habitats within the utility power line areas and similar sites present interesting cases in which patterns of otherwise uncontrolled urban and suburban development are interrupted, although often they function in support of those very forms of development they partially resist. Perhaps there is some very loose comparison to be made to various areas of \u201cnew wilderness\u201d that result from a mixture of both management and conflict, like the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site\u2014both of which are forms of inadvertent nature preservation born out of the Anthropocene.",

Reshaping the Shape seeks to follow the stories and forms through which the Asian Carp might be reimagined and transformed from public enemy to a mascot of a global commons. In following the fish\u2019s journey through the economic and cultural landscape, viewers are invited to consider how humans have made the rivers more habitable for the carp.

According to our tour guides, the state\u2019s efforts to \u201creconnect the river to the delta\u201d using an array of projects that include marsh creation, shoreline protection, barrier island restoration, and sediment diversions reflect a departure from a long tradition of trying and failing to dominate the river with levees and other physical flood control structures. For many, Louisiana\u2019s Coastal Master Plan offers the promise of a more harmonious and \u201cgreener\u201d relationship between humans, the river, and the delta. The limits of transformative thinking, however, quickly became clear on our tour. During a Q&amp;A session, one visitor asked how the multiple engineering projects in the plan would affect local communities throughout the region. After a pause, our guide emphasized that the state had learned valuable lessons in recent years and was doing much better than in previous iterations of the planning process. He mentioned multiple partnerships with nonprofits in the region and emphasized that one state agency (Louisiana\u2019s Office of Community Development) has prioritized community engagement as they administered federal funding for the Isle de Jean Charles resettlement and Louisiana\u2019s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE) program. \u201cThat will take care of those people outside of the Morganza to the Gulf Levee system,\u201d he assured, referring to a planned U.S. Army Corps 98-mile levee system dubbed by some as \u201cThe Great Wall of Louisiana.\u201d As we were being directed towards the river model, he added, \u201cAnd well, with the diversions, nobody really lives down there.\u201d I was shocked. The tour guide\u2019s comments evaded the reality that the Morganza to the Gulf levee system increased flood risk on Isle de Jean Charles. Moreover, he cast their resettlement as a state-led exemplar of community engagement despite reports that describe the process as a hijacking of Tribal-led planning. Furthermore, he disregarded the very existence of the Atakapa-Ishak Chawasha Grand Bayou Village and numerous Black communities located near the major proposed sediment diversions in Plaquemines Parish. The erasure of Black and Indigenous peoples is pervasive throughout the historical and contemporary United States, including within environmental movements and environmental studies education. Due to the troubling encounter at the Center for River Sciences and long-standing ecocide throughout the region, here we offer some experiences, expertise, and initiatives from Tribal and community leaders most immediately affected by the land loss crisis and institutional responses to it, perspectives from some of those most committed to ecological sustainability for future generations in this region.

How has human activity altered your homelands? Elder Philippe: We are the first people of this place. We have lived a life in concert with the predictable seasonal changes, which naturally occur. Every part of our survival as a people has depended on our being attuned not only to the violent changes witnessed in nature, but the subtle nuances of change as well. As we traveled through our lands, our footprints were easily absorbed back into nature. We let nature predict how we should live our lives. We were, and still are, subsistent resource gatherers, but now our lifeworld has become less predictable since European invasion. The changes began with encroachment, resources that were exclusively used for the People had to then also support an incoming population. Trees were cut, lands cleared, communities built, and food resources were gathered to support newcomer populations that had moved onto our lands. The newcomers brought with them new ways of living with the Earth, ways of manipulation and control, and diseases, forever changing the landscape and the lifeworld of the People. The \u201chardening\u201d of their lives, pitting themselves against nature through manipulation and control of the geology and the planet\u2019s natural processes, is the major cause of the problems we are facing today: global warming, land loss, negative phenology impacts, the genocide of Tribal lifeways, and the pandemic.",

Our means of healing ourselves are all but an ancient practice, soon to be a memory due to the extinction of our medicinal plants. Our traditional ways of sustenance are no longer possible due to repeated random flooding events, pollution, and overfishing. Our homelands haven\u2019t just been altered; they\u2019re being destroyed. Secretary Comardelle: Like others have said, we have known how to live with the land and sea. I often say that we live and die by the sea. It&#8217;s a balance of survival for all.\u00a0 Our ancestors were clearly better at this balancing act than we currently are. We have over-extracted from this great Earth, and there are some clear consequences to our actions. We are losing flora that heals us due to saltwater intrusion. The trapping industry has all but ceased to exist outside of nutria due to over harvesting, marsh damage, and coastal erosion. I believe there is a footprint so big on \u201cour\u201d land that we can no longer see the beauty in the surroundings. Theresa Dardar: Coastal land loss is a big problem. We have very little left to our barrier islands. Ponds look like lakes. We had a wealth of ecological and economic resources on our barrier islands and in the extensive estuaries, most importantly commercial and recreational fishing resources. Now commercial and recreational fishing is not very good. The activities that have altered our homelands started in 1891 with the cutting and floating of cypress trees. In 1905 a well was drilled on the edge of the marsh a few hundred yards from Bayou Terrebonne. That was the beginning of the oil companies cutting canals, which caused the saltwater intrusion, erosion of the land, and kills trees. The landscape has changed because of the logging and oil companies. Just about everyone in the past planted their gardens and had fresh vegetables. The ones that didn\u2019t plant would trade eggs, pig, beef meat, or seafood for fresh vegetables. Because of saltwater intrusion caused by the cutting of canals by oil companies and sea levels rising from climate change not many people plant gardens. \u00a0The BP Oil Spill in 2010 also hurt by causing more land loss. Our community no longer looks the same. We followed the way of our ancestors in work and subsistence. As our ancestors did, we too live off the land. They had cattle, pigs, chickens, trapped various animals, hunted, fished oysters, crabs and shrimp.\u00a0 We fish not only to make a living, but because it is also part of our diet. We share our catch with the elders and those who may be fishing a different kind of seafood. Because of saltwater intrusion and land loss, trapping is no longer profitable either. There is no land or marsh and so no animals to trap.",

Elder Philippe: The aforementioned practices are in direct conflict with the ways of living of the People. In our lifeway practices, nature and natural processes dictate how human life proceeds. We take our clues from the natural happenings and plan our lives around those events, not the other way around. We don\u2019t try to bend nature to our will and choices. Our life teachings are in conflict with the systems that are now in place in the world, and our communities have been pushed to the edge as we try to resist the destructive practices of the powers that be, a global system more focused on commerce and power than protecting and keeping our natural world intact. We, the People, know that eventually nature will prevail, and the manipulators will lose. It is unfortunate that we only have one home world to share. We will be unable to replicate what we are losing. Secretary Comardelle: For centuries Indigenous peoples around the world have grappled with explorers, conquerors, and entrepreneurs making their communities \u201cbetter.\u201d This has tattered the fabric of our people. Who really benefits from big corporations, new governments, and their industries? Granted, we all love electricity and modern technologies, but should it cost us our heritage? Our cultural traditions? Our way of life and sense of self? In the case of Isle de Jean Charles, with the first oil rig came commerce, modernization, and education for our people. That is celebrated, but what we don&#8217;t consider enough is what was sacrificed\u2026 tradition, culture, identity, heritage, and the ways of living and being that helped us survive for so long. Theresa Dardar: After the BP Oil Spill, we had to have barbeque instead of seafood for Tribal socials, and the crab boil gatherings we had two to three times a week stopped. Our traditional diet changed with more meat than seafood. Our area is now more vulnerable to storm surge. It causes damage to property, and problems with transportation because of flooding of roads. We sometimes flood with just a tropical storm or even strong south east winds. Now, our fishers also have many challenges; low prices, import shrimp, fuel prices, land loss and not a lot of shrimp or crabs. Land loss cause danger in thunderstorms or just strong winds, when they brew up, especially if they are out on the water in a small boat. Islands in the past were protection for the fishers. Now when winds come it makes the waters rough and no protection causing danger to the fishers. And because of land loss, sea level rise and climate change, their catch is less. For example, this year white shrimp season opened Monday August 10, 2020 at 6:00 p.m. and boats were in early that night because they didn\u2019t find any shrimp. Chief Parfait-Dardar: To sum it up, continued generational genocidal practices, environmental destruction and greed have forced us to continually adapt. Our traditional practices are more difficult to teach to younger generations with the loss of land, depletion of food sources and medicinal plants. As a people connected to the land and water, when it disappears, so do our lifeways and ultimately our identity.",

As I said, people in the community also fish for fresh seafood. We share seafood with family and neighbors. We are also building a greenhouse, which will be used as a teaching tool. We will take the children/youth to the greenhouse during Culture Camp to teach the names and uses of plants. We will all probably learn from having the greenhouse, trying to locate plants our ancestors used that are no longer growing in the community. We will ask Natural Resources Conservation Service to help locate plants. We also make ointments and tea to treat our sick, going back to our traditional healing. The land has always fed us and healed our ancestors, and it can do the same for us if we relearn how to use the plants.",

                "text": "NJ: Elder Philippe, you described colonial attempts to control and manipulate the landscape, and Ms. Theresa, you described the long history of extraction in the region. The direct threads from colonialism to climate emergency and from private property and infrastructure to ecological genocide seem so stark. The U.S. Swamp Land Acts of 1849, 1850, and 1860 expanded private property relations throughout the region while incentivizing the draining of wetlands for agriculture.Craig E. Colten, \u201cEnvironmental management in coastal Louisiana: A historical review,\u201dJournal of Coastal Research,\u00a033 (3), 2017, pp.699-711.Throughout the late nineteenth century, prospectors grabbed up the land. Then, the Texas Company (later Texaco, now Chevron) became the first major oil and gas extractor in the wetlands in the early twentieth century. Their investments in Terrebonne Parish kept land companies like Louisiana Land &amp; Exploration (now ConocoPhillips) &amp; La Terre (now Apache Oil) financially afloat and ensured a century of ecocide. Meanwhile, throughout the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century, the U.S. government expanded the levee system and river controls along the Mississippi River and it\u2019s distributaries. This starved the naturally sinking delta of soil needed to keep building land. In 1903, Bayou Lafourche was severed from the river, preventing sediment renewal in some of the quickest subsiding areas in the Terrebonne and Barataria Basins. Your Tribes, along with the Avoyel-Taensa Tribe and Bayou Lafourche Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, however, have formed the\u00a0First Peoples\u2019 Conservation Council\u00a0(FPCC) to address the effects of these ongoing histories of exploitation and destruction. Journalist Christine Baniewicz recently\u00a0wrote about\u00a0FPCC-led efforts to backfill pipeline canals in order to save sacred sites, and according to that reporting, this work is not included in or supported by the state\u2019s current Coastal Master Plan. Theresa Dardar: We started the FPCC in 2012 to help better our communities. Pointe-Au-Chien Indian Tribe has been able to get grants through the FPCC. That is how we were able to get the bulkhead/dock and the greenhouse by the building. We also have regular gatherings of the six tribes to learn how to make crafts, and we have guest speakers at these gatherings. We will not be able to have the gathering this year because of the pandemic.",

Additionally through particular programs, the existence and efforts of some of your\u00a0Tribes have been recognized by other\u00a0agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\u00a0However, since the 1970s the U.S. government has used a process of federal acknowledgement to determine which Indigenous peoples are entitled to certain kinds of support. This process has been criticized for being slow, draining, arbitrary, divisive, and premised on racist notions of indigeneity.Joanne Barker, Native Acts: Law, Recognition, and Cultural Authenticity. Durham: Duke University Press, 2011; Amy E. Den Ouden and Jean M. O\u2019Brien, eds. Recognition, Sovereignty Struggles, and Indigenous Rights in the United States. UNC Press Books, 2013.\u00a0As of now, none of your Tribes have been formally recognized by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) or Congress. Would federal recognition of your inherent sovereignty from the BIA or Congress support your ability to protect your communities and ecological relations?  Theresa Dardar: I think if we had federal recognition, we could get protection for our sacred places and maybe get homes elevated. If we would have had recognition when the BP Oil Spill happened, we would have been able to get workers in our community working with the government instead of having to get our attorney to work with BP to clean up our area. There is a lot of red tape to get recognition. They want a paper trail, but our ancestors didn\u2019t read or write. We should not have to prove who we are, not after all the discrimination we have lived through, and still do sometimes. We had to attend Indian schools and were not allowed in some places. All we should need is our school records from the school board. But even then, that wouldn\u2019t help everyone, because most of our elders didn\u2019t have a school to go to. Most of the birth certificates do not prove anything because when some of us were born, they were listed as black or white, not Indian. Elder Philippe: In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act, an all-inclusive act, was passed by Congress. The privileges of citizenship, however, were largely governed by state law, and the right to vote was often denied to Native Americans in the early twentieth century. While it is true that our communities and people enjoy a collaborative relationship with various government entities, I must note that this has happened over a vast space of time and these small measures of cooperation has only come about through hard work and efforts of visionary people supporting the concept of justice for all. This government has not, from its inception, considered the rights of its Indigenous population. The laws and rules enacted were designed to disenfranchise Native American populations. The laws and mandates of the federal recognition process remain unjust, biased, and based on an antiquated view of Native American people. The federal system still holds itself as judge and jury with self-given authority to say who is Native and who is not. The recognition criteria and its mandates of what constitutes proof is based on timelines and a paper trail where Tribes have been reduced to a footnote by some person/persons of European descent. Paper documentation is not an Indigenous concept and was widely unpracticed by Indigenous populations. Though many Tribes have been identified by such criteria, there has been varying degrees of interaction during colonization and government control. Many Tribes were tracked and recorded by various government agencies, because the People were enslaved and placed in concentration camps called \u201creservations,\u201d where they were subjected to an inhuman existence\u2026 but thus are able to meet the government\u2019s current criteria mandates. Other groups who were fortunate enough to escape the harsh reality of the forced Indian removals and relocations, and who were hidden, are now faced with the untenable task of proving their existence and claiming their sovereignty.\u00a0 We are the FIRST people of this land and are the last people this government has given rights to as equal citizens with other people who are now living in this country (who I called \u2018newcomers\u2019 above). Attaining federal recognition under the current laws is almost like giving validity to their supposed right to define, recognize, or deny us, the First People of this land. The only benefit, I believe, to federal recognition would be that Tribes could interact with the government from a position of having more power than we have now. That would give us a platform to negotiate change, replacing current mandates with ones that would reflect true and just choices for the People, drafted by the People. Under the current process, we are still being subjugated and disenfranchised by a system where money rules the day and denotes who has the power of decision. Chief Parfait-Dardar: It is a broken system meant to strip Tribes of their governance and inherent sovereign rights. While we are currently going through this system, because it is what it is; we do not agree with it. The only benefit is that we would be able to have access to some resources for housing and education, but we are very limited in our ability to govern traditionally and are forced to adopt a process similar to the United States government. To me this is simply another means of controlling Natives and stripping them of their sovereignty and traditional practices in exchange for small benefits that also keep us dependent on the federal government. One doesn\u2019t have to look far to see that federal acknowledgement isn\u2019t all its portrayed to be. Just look at the Standing Rock battle. Secretary Comardelle: I agree with Chief Shirell and others, the federal acknowledgement process seems like a broken system to colonize Native communities: \u201cWe will give you this little money but no real support.\u201d But at this point though, we do think federal recognition would help us in our struggle for cultural survival. The really sick part for us is that we have been told by the State of Louisiana that we can\u2019t get our Tribal community resettlement, because we ain\u2019t federally recognized. Then, because of the way the state has used the federal funds for the resettlement, we run the risk of not getting federally recognized. NJ: Chief Albert and Secretary Comardelle, the Isle de Jean Charles Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribal leaders have been planning your Tribal Community Resettlement for nearly twenty years in response to generations of forced displacement, ecocide, exclusion from regional flood protection, and future flood risk associated with the climate emergency. Would you share where these plans stand now and some of what you have learned along the long road towards resettlement? Chief Albert Naquin: Our first considering of resettlement started in 1999. My first reaction was it was a modern day \u201cTrail of Tears.\u201d Then to be fair I called a council and community meeting to discuss the possibility of moving off the Island. My reaction changed when I started thinking why I had moved off the Island. I was discharged from the Army in February 1971 and got married in August. I also had a day job and had to go to work in the morning and come home in the evening. Hurricane Carmen in 1974 put twelve inches of water in my house. Most of my appliances and furniture were destroyed. I bought a piece of land off the Island and built a house, moved in my new home 1975 and been here ever since. In some ways I felt selfish, because I was tired of flooding so moved off the Island. Others have felt like they had to move off too over the years, so I asked how many would consider moving to a new community to bring our Tribal community back together again. In 2002, I explained what I knew at the time. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (ACE) wanted 100% of the residents to go. I don\u2019t know of any community who could get 100% to agree on anything, let alone something so big. Anyway, by the time we had the meeting with the ACE, we had 85%. I figured when the people see the plan for the new community, the rest would join. In June 2002, we had the meeting and there were people from all over yelling that they weren\u2019t moving. I told the man in charge that those people were not from the Island, but he didn\u2019t know who was who, so we called off the meeting. The council went to New Orleans to meet with the Army Corps of Engineers. They still wanted a 100%, but by then the count had dropped to about 65%. I gave up on the Corps to support our plans at that point. It is a process and the rules did not allow for that. Fast forward to Hurricane Gustav and Ike in 2008. These storms banged up our little community. The parish received money to get us off the Island, so we refocused on our plan. It was going so well. It seemed like a sure thing. We had our proposal together and were really ready for the big meeting. The night of the meeting in February of 2009. It was a full house. Since the plot of land that we had in mind was next to a large subdivision, the people from the subdivision showed up in protest. They said that we would bring down their property values. It was another battle lost. We did not stop planning though despite all the setbacks in partnering with government agencies. In 2014, the Tribe started working on a plan for resettlement along with the Lowlander Center. We worked and worked and worked to put together a version of our plan that turned heads from all over the world. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development had one billion dollars to help communities through the National Disaster Resilience Competition. We jumped on it and Louisiana\u2019s Office of Community Development said they would help us. To make a long story short, the state included our Tribal community resettlement plans in their application for funds, then the state hijacked the plans once they got the money. They are picking and choosing our plans and using it as the want, not to benefit the Tribe. Our plan would have cost about $110 million at the time so we figured the $48 millions we received from HUD was halfway to our goal. The state took control of the resettlement, purchased the land we chose for our home, and now we can\u2019t get money to put our community back together as planned. The state uses our name, so now when we ask for money or support, we are told that we already got a grant for resettlement.",

We have watched our families lose everything they own, rebuild just to lose it all again in a year or two. I have been a long advocate for resettlement. I saw it as a bridge from the Island to a new place for us to have some justice and our culture. But being involved in the National Disaster Resilience Competition process has really changed how I feel about it. They turned our vision into a subdivision. They turned our Tribe\u2019s future into a public community with a park and ball field and no commitments to our future. We have to ask how someone can say an entire community is not feasible or the cost-benefit ratio is not large enough to protect?

                "text": "NJ: What have the other Tribal and community leaders learned by watching the IDJC resettlement process unfold? Elder Philippe: What I have learned from watching the IDJC resettlement process unfold is this. I believe when there is a substantial amount of money involved and the government is your partner, they will find ways to re-interpret or re-define laws and legal concepts to their own benefit. They are able to seize control of the money and adulterate the entire process so that the Tribe\u2019s vision, that was approved and funded, no longer reflects said vision, thereby creating conflict between the Tribe and the government. It is in this conflict where the government, in my opinion, gives itself and its actors an excuse to completely hijack the process and exclude the Tribe from taking part in the decisions. When there is an imbalance in the power construct (e.g. Government over Tribe), I would have a bevy of lawyers study, interpret, and draft the proposal, making sure that all concepts were considered and making sure that control would remain under Tribal rule before entering into an unbalanced partnership. But all of that is hindsight. The long and short of it is when your \u201cpartner\u201d does not have your well-being as a priority, that is not a partner. Chief Parfait-Dardar: This seems to be a never-ending nightmare that has only solidified the truths known by Native peoples for many generations. If you want something done right, you have to pray and be self-reliant, no matter how challenging it may be. Time and time again, our faith in those who have offered to assist us, who lack the intimate understanding and respect of our traditional ways and culture, has proven to be destructive. Theresa Dardar: I have learned not to trust anyone from the state. If you have to deal with the state in your community, have an attorney deal with them for you. If your community decides to move and you are looking for funds, it would be best if you don\u2019t involve the state\u2019s Office of Community Development! NJ: In recent years, the notion of a \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d from the coast has become more widely discussed as a governmental response to rising seas. This concept has also stirred critical debate on how the racialized, class, and colonial politics of development are internalized within climate adaptation. See Liz Koslov, \u201cThe case for retreat,\u201d Public Culture, 28(2 (79)), pp.359-387, 2016 and also J Maldonado, E Marino, L Iaukea, \u201cRetreat\u201d from rising seas? It\u2019s not just semantics. EOS: Science News by AGU, (Forthcoming, 2020).\u00a0What do you think of this phrase? What does it sound like it might mean for your communities and Tribes? Secretary Comardelle: \u201cManaged Retreat\u201d and resettlement have different interpretations. We had a Tribal community resettlement, but people keep calling it an example of managed retreat. Because a small ridge of land is only good and profitable for the oil or as a \u201csportsman paradise,\u201d so then let&#8217;s invest in that, now that the Indians are gone. And let\u2019s profit by learning about how to move these Indians. Managed retreat is another form of assimilation and colonialism. We need to wake up and realize what we are collectively allowing to happen. We need to say that enough is enough. Theresa Dardar: I don\u2019t like \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d because it makes me think of the Trail of Tears. If American Indian communities need to move that should be their decisions, not the state or anyone else. It should be the decision of the people living in the community and no one else. American Indians are connected to their community, which includes the land. My grandfather was 88 years old when he died. He lived all his life with no running water, electricity, or inside toilet, and he wouldn\u2019t move away. His children knew not to try and make him move. His life and work were connected to the land. The state or anyone else will not decide if our community has to move. It will always be the people\u2019s choice if they want to move or stay. We are connected to our community. Our roots and our work are here. Men just have to walk across the street to get to their boat to go to work. To move bayou people to a city is like taking a fish out of the water. Elder Philippe: \u201cManaged retreat\u201d is like calling a pig a hog. It\u2019s the same thing as \u201cforced relocation\u201d only now it\u2019s being called something different. Terminologies are very important, and sometimes seemingly reasonable people quickly accept a proposed concept. They begin to repeat and refer to said terminology when referencing a certain idea, creating a new mantra of sorts. \u201cManaged retreat\u201d? Oh, how logical and reasonable that concept seems at surface value. Many who are championing this concept have not done their due diligence and have no idea how this concept would play out in real time and real-life applications, especially when this concept would be applied to Native American communities; communities where place-based habitation is measured in centuries. Home means more than geographical location. For Native communities, culture and traditions are connected to places where sacred connections are made and practiced. Those particular connections of place and prayers are not replicable just because you moved to another location. For years Native people were subjected to forced removal, not having a say in when, how, or where they were removed to. If the people who are the subject of this retreat are not in control or have the final word in the process, then this is just a new term for an old unjust practice, and you are just renaming a pig a hog! Chief Parfait-Dardar: This terminology needs to be dismantled. It is simply another form of government controlled, forced relocation. Every community has its own dynamics, its own identity. The only people who should be managing a retreat, if that is what they so choose, is the community and they should be in charge of the terminology and ways of thinking about their resettlement. Period! NJ: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2018), global warming will reach 1.5\u00b0C more than pre-industrial levels as early as 2030. Any warmer, according to the report, will lead to the worst of the worst conditions: Even more extreme daily temperature variations, drought, heatwaves, vector-borne diseases, ocean acidification, sea level rise, and extreme weather than we are currently experiencing. The report argues that remaining below 1.5\u00b0C requires urgent and significant energy transformations, including substantial reductions in oil and natural gas development. In August of this year, Louisiana Governor Jon Bel Edwards signed an executive order that formed a Climate Initiatives Task Force and committed to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Despite this, and all the talk of restoration and resilience, the State of Louisiana continues to permit industrial terminals and tries to push through new pipelines throughout your territories and sensitive wetlands. Additionally, state agencies are encouraging coastal gentrification, the creation of a \u201csportsman\u2019s paradise\u201d as you said, Secretary Comardelle. I\u2019m thinking, for example, about recent plans to use 2010 BP Oil Disaster money to build fishing piers to Island Road despite earlier refusals to make new investments in the road prior to the Isle de Jean Charles resettlement funding allocation.",

What would you hope to see in an energy transition or climate change adaptation to make it more just for your Tribes?  Chief Parfait-Dardar: It\u2019s all Native land. In some cases, we can track the documents proving treaties and illegal land grabbing. Of course, local, state and federal governments use the federal acknowledgement process as a rationale for not honoring or protecting the Tribe\u2019s territories and governance. There is no law that prevents local or state governments from honoring the treaties or from respecting the sovereign rights of historically known Indigenous Nations. It\u2019s past time that they stop the ridiculous thinking that we\u2019re not intelligent enough to know that they\u2019re violating our laws and the rights of our land. It\u2019s also past time that they be held accountable for their destructive practices that has endangered aboriginal peoples. Elder Philippe: I think the government should practice what it preaches. Our government polices human rights violations around the globe, sanctioning actions, bringing violators into compliance, and sometimes ensuring that disenfranchised people receive justice. However, at home, government is the major perpetrator of continuing human rights violations against its own Indigenous populations. By deed or neglect, the first people of this land continue to face the consequences of not having our contributions to this country acknowledged and not having our cultures and traditions respected. We have been pushed to the fringes and made to live in substandard conditions, because our government refuses to invest resources to assist us in maintaining our lifeways; lifeways that were in place and thrived before they invaded our homelands. Until policies and laws are all-inclusive and Tribal sovereignty sits at the table of decision making, our work is unfinished and the struggle for justice is not over. Theresa Dardar: They should follow the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. For example, our government is guilty of violating IDJC human rights by excluding Chief Albert from deciding what is right for his people. They divide communities, which then leads to losing culture and traditions. Indigenous people are connected to the land but if the community has to move out of harm\u2019s way, and the whole community moves to one location, then perhaps culture and tradition will not be lost. But it is not only happening here. The violations are happening to our brothers and sisters around the world. The government doesn\u2019t have to embrace our culture, but they should at least respect it. Instead, they force their culture on our people. Secretary Comardelle: I agree, and also, we had this in our resettlement plans. It was supposed to be a pilot for sustainability, not just moving people. A whole pilot program is being wasted by the state just so they can say: it failed and here is what we learned while it failed. $48 million dollars for that. Before we got any money, we worked with partners like the Lowlander Center to pull together all the best practices for sustainability, for resettlement. The state ignored it once they got the money and are now doing their own thing. NJ: Right. As you expressed earlier, the scope of your resettlement plans have been reduced by the state since they began administering the National Disaster Resilience Competition funds drifting from a plan that honors the Tribe\u2019s sovereignty and embraces building upon the Tribe\u2019s capacity as a teaching community into a kind of non-Tribal subdivision with some moderate investments in renewable energy, resilient design, and water retention. Recently, the state released another request for proposals (RFP) for contractors to \u201cdesign-build\u201d the homes and site. According to one designer who worked on the state plans, a \u201cdesign-build\u201d contract after the designs have already been completed is \u201cextremely atypical\u201d and \u201cby giving the contractor the ability to edit drawings, the responsibility to ensure that design intent is carried through falls on the program manager and limits their ability to hold the contractor accountable to the design intent embedded in the previous bid set drawings.\u201d This raises a question as to whether or not the renewable energy and resilience design components that were included, even in the distorted non-Tribal-produced version of the resettlement plans, will be included in the final outcome. It appears as though the state\u2019s Office of Community Development has slowly removed critically important aspects of the resettlement and produced immense uncertainty in their prioritization of moving remaining residents from the Island. Sociologist Daniel Aldana CohenDaniel Aldana Cohen,\u00a0\u201cNew York City as \u2018fortress of solitude\u2019 after Hurricane Sandy: a relational sociology of extreme weather\u2019s relationship to climate politics,\u201d\u00a0Environmental Politics, 2020.\u00a0recently wrote about \u201cselective continuity\u201d as a kind of strategy by which decarbonization has been removed from climate adaptation in New York City. Moreover, Thea RiofrancosThea Riofrancos, &#8220;What Green Costs,&#8221; Logic, (9), 2019. describes how the prevailing market-driven energy transition is also harming Indigenous communities through \u201cgreen extractivism.\u201d It strikes me that through the management of continuity and extracting of ideas your Tribe developed with partners, the state has enabled a kind of adaptation capitalism in the procurement processes while undermining the potential of your Tribal community resettlement as an effort to both decolonize AND decarbonize. Secretary Comardelle: Yes, our original plans had renewable energy and building relationships between our Tribe and others as a teaching and learning community. Now there\u2019s no renewable energy, no solar, nothing. The thing is we have a lot of our citizens that work in oil and gas, so we wanted to get ahead of the changes that we know are coming.

What is the significance of that commission, and what kinds of things do you hope that Commission will accomplish? Chief Parfait-Dardar: This is the first time that we have an opportunity to have a voice that will continue to be present, regardless of whether or not the Governor decides to appoint a Director of the Louisiana Department of Indian Affairs. Our hope is to be able to address the many challenges faced by tribal peoples and having a legitimate government to government relationship with the State of Louisiana. One of the challenges is creating a just State Recognition process through the Commission, so that another tribe seeking recognition will not have to face attacks against their pursuit by being told that they only want a casino or having to deal will political biases. We plan on addressing education, housing and healthcare needs, just to name a few. So, yes, the Commission is a huge success and we\u2019re very thankful to Representative Tanner Magee for his efforts and recognizing that this was crucial for improving governance in the State of Louisiana. NJ: At the moment, we are also in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. How is this affecting your communities?  Chief Parfait-Dardar: When you destroy your environment, you open yourselves to so many possible negative challenges. It\u2019s common sense really. Destroy your environment and you destroy yourselves. We are now beginning to have more cases within our community, and we are doing our best to stay socially distanced, wear masks and utilize our traditional teachings to aid in our healing. In August Representative Steve Scalise announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would purchase $30 million in shrimp from Louisiana\u2019s Gulf Coast as part of their pandemic economic response. Shrimping as a traditional practice has been steadily declining due to all of the environmental changes and unjust regulations that only benefit processing plants and large vessel harvesters. Add the impacts created by the BP Oil Spill, which are still being felt today, and you can understand why our youth are not being taught to continue this as a means of sustaining their families. So this is important to us, especially as we try to recover. Unfortunately, we have yet to hear from Representative Scalise and are starting to wonder if he is avoiding working with us to ensure that our Traditional Harvesters receive their fair portion of the monies. Theresa Dardar: Socializing has come to a standstill in our community. Our community has survived because we were always able to come support each other. We can still support from a distance, but it is not the same as being able to go to help our elders if needed. Now even if our relative is in the hospital, we can\u2019t be with them. Our tribal meetings have gone from in person meetings to Zoom and phones. No socializing after the meeting. The green house is on hold because of social distance. Elder Philippe: Socializing is a large part of our culture. From our beginning to our present, we have survived because we were able to come together as a group. The isolation and separation are proving to be daunting. I think we have more questions than answers at this point\u2026what were the conditions that gave birth to COVID-19; how do we prevent future outbreaks of similar or potentially deadlier viruses, what changes, as a global population, do we need to make, how do we survive the next pandemic event? NJ: Finally, how might readers support your long-standing and ongoing efforts? Elder Philippe:\u00a0Think and ask questions. Hold those in power accountable to how they wield that power. Advocate for and speak the truth. Remember life is precious, and not just human life. Our lives are intricately tied to, and depend on, the survival of other life forms in our world. Our survival is tied to how we live with this planet. Animal life, plant life, insect life and other lifeforms do not need humans to survive (in fact other life forms seem to thrive when interaction with humans is minimized/non-existent&#8230;the same cannot be said of the reverse, we (humans) would surely perish if these other life forms did not exist. Concerning relocation and so-called \u201cmanaged retreat,\u201d first and foremost sovereign right to self-determination must be upheld. If we allow ourselves to be moved or relocated to other places, what will be said of the places we now occupy; our homelands? Places where our spirits are fully awakened. For coastal people it\u2019s the smell of the verdant greens of the marsh, the taste of salt in the air, the feeling of moisture on our skin, and the almost imperceptible sway of the lands beneath our feet. It is a place like no other; a place of divine sovereignty to the People. Other people will say this is an abandoned area\u00a0if we leave. We who have been rooted in place for so many centuries\u00a0will\u00a0become strangers in a different land and will eventually be relegated to the oblivion of assimilation and forgetfulness.\u00a0We know that time and events incite shortened memories when no one is left to invoke memories and practice traditions. We need to occupy our lands, so that our voices and the voices of our non-human relatives will continue to be brought forward as the future presents opportunities for Indigenous voices to be heard. There are none more Indigenous than the flora and fauna, the true &#8220;first inhabitants&#8221; of this world. We, the People, need to be seen, to really be seen, and for folks to see us for who we really are. We are not just communities pushed to the edge. We are not only to be defined by who we were in the past or the circumstances we currently face. See us for who we really are. We are survivors, original inhabitants, and contributors. We are not only contributors to our own lifeways and to this place, but to other places and people beyond our lands. We need everyone to recognize our strengths and respect our contributions. We continue to work towards that goal because what is the other option\u2026 Oblivion? Chief Parfait-Dardar: I couldn\u2019t have said it better than Elder Philippe. Always seek to improve by creating positive change and be respectful of all of our relations. Theresa Dardar: Although the oil companies and others claim this land, so do we. We will never abandon where our mounds are. We bring the children and youth to the mounds and cemeteries so they can see and know where some of their ancestors lived and are buried. We will never abandon the land of our ancestors. If we did, it would be like cutting our roots. We can\u2019t bring back what was lost because of the damage oil companies have done. We are trying to save the mounds and cemeteries and will continue to do that. We are also planning to do another oyster shell project. We are always looking for ways to restore around our community and teach the children, youth, and young adults. Also, the First Peoples Conservation Council is always trying to get funds to help the communities.",

Our seminar\u2014Risk/Equity, held in November of 2019 as part of the Anthropocene River Campus in New Orleans\u2014articulated how risk assessment and management are at the heart of environmental justice. The adverse risks of climate change and ecological degradation are never shared equally across the globe or even within a region. This seminar explored the paired concepts of risk and equity as expressed through the lived experiences of residents in the lower Mississippi River, and the infrastructures of greater New Orleans. It brought the concepts of the \u201cslow disaster\u201d to bear, thinking about industrialization and toxicity not merely as quantifiable events on a timeline, but as exceedingly slow processes of environmental and human stress, and locating the effects in the everyday lives and coping strategies of communities that persist and resist. Seminar participants worked with conveners to gain background knowledge in these concepts, and then applied them to field experiences in conjunction with community partners. Special care was taken to emphasize that participants would be working within pre-existing channels of mutuality and collaboration, focused on the work of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN), the Louisiana Universities Resilient Architecture Collaborative (LURAC), and the Louisiana Landmarks Society (LLS).\u00a0 Rather than foster \u201ctoxic tourism,\u201d participants deepened their facility with slow disaster through the development of methods of local action\u2014working on a project that was launched in September through the activities of the New Orleans Anthropocene Field Campus. The project is still underway, though slowed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and revolves around the formation of a community archive, allowing opportunities for participants who may wish to remain active and engaged in the localized work and partnerships. We proceed now, as we did in November of 2019, in a spirit and practice of \u201cmutual aid\u201d\u2014trying as best as we can to erase the dark lines that somehow separate the residents of communities suffering pollution, and visitors (like the seminar conveners) to those communities.\u00a0 The areas we visited in 2019 with seminar participants are among the hardest hit from COVID-19 in the USA\u2014not because of population density, but because of the \u201cpre-condition\u201d of poor air quality and lung distress experienced every day by residents over the past decades. The slow disaster of the Anthropocene in Cancer Alley lays the groundwork for the pandemic here. Ultimately, the common project of learning, documenting, and acting against the monstrous injustice of environmental pollution helps us build a bond\u2014a community.\u00a0 This essay collects several of the experiences of seminar leaders, but also points the way towards continuing collaborations, especially in the grim new era of COVID-19 from which we make these preliminary reflections.

It offers opportunities to mobilize a range of bodily sensations, generating particular feelings and moments of epiphany. M. Crang and I. Cook, Doing Ethnographies. London: Sage, 2007. The bodily dimension of field research was especially strongly felt in the Risk/Equity seminar, which was concerned with environmental health issues. Our field trip largely followed the traditional format in the sense that participants were invited to observe sites of environmental justice action in the New Orleans 9th Ward and in Cancer Alley, as well as to meet local activists including Wilma Subra and members of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN). These opportunities helped the participants to mobilize their bodily sensations to understand the field, and carefully reflect on their embodied findings. Later in the afternoon, participants were asked to note down a few quick thoughts on their bodily experiences by thinking about: what they saw, heard, smelled, touched, and breathed. We did see many smokestacks, oil, and water tanks, cylinders of petrochemical factories. On the east side of the river from Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway, energy generating facilities, such as Little Gypsy Power Plant, and oil refineries like NORCO were in operation. The other side of the river was occupied by petrochemical manufacturers such as Dow Chemical and Ammonia Terminal. It was a windy day. Smoke from the factories and sugarcane growing in front of them were blown from side to side. The wind also brought with it a distinctive smell\u2014something like the odor of iron, manure, or garbage. When hopping off the bus, we could not help but inhale it. The unpleasant smell served as a reminder that we were breathing pollutants including chloroprene, ethylene oxide, and formaldehyde. As highlighted in the handouts we had received at the start of the trip, these are the top toxic chemicals that contaminate the bodies of human and nature in the lower Mississippi delta. S. Lerner, \u201cA tale of two toxic cities: the EPA\u2019s bungled response to an air pollution crisis exposes a toxic racial divide\u201d, The Intercept, 24 Feb 2019. The numbers in the documents suggested that St. Charles parish is an \u201cexceptional\u201d place where the risk of cancer from air pollution is strikingly higher than elsewhere in the US. This argument was convincing. Our own bodily experiences, on the other hand, somehow reminded how \u201cuniversal\u201d such environmental health problems are. What we saw, heard, and smelled were not entirely new and strange. Rather, these were familiar names, sounds and odors, which could be found in our own everyday lives, both near and far. The same names that adorn the signage of industrial facilities appear on the labels of household items at home and in offices, and the products manufactured here in NOLA are similarly mundane in their \u201ceverydayness\u201d\u2014oil, gas, plastics, rubber and sugar. These are the staples of modern life. As one participant mentioned, anybody who drove and flew to get to the Anthropocene River Campus could not easily absolve themselves of a sense of complicity in of the Anthropocene of the lower Mississippi River, a space engineered to generate fossil fuel. For another participant, the distinctive smell evoked her memories of childhood spent in an Asian industrial town in the early 1990s. Like St. Charles parish, the unpleasant smell of iron and rubber was often blown into the village and gave local residents headaches and nausea. Through the sharing of this experience, spatial and temporal distances were suddenly annihilated, bringing us together in a united front in the face of the Anthropocene. In thinking about and working on environmental health, our lived experience might have more in common than we have previously thought. The violence exercised upon the muscles of enslaved Black people in the eighteenth century, as well as to the lungs of local residents in St. Charles parish today has parallels with from the violence inflicted on the bodies of deprivileged residents in industrial towns in Asia. In all these cases, political, economic, and ecological inequality has been reproduced in the past, as well as in the present. Embodied field research in New Orleans enabled us to \u201cnotice\u201d common and shared elements involved in the formation and operation of the Anthropocene\u2014such as violence. The \u201cart of noticing\u201d, as proposed by Anna Tsing, A. L Tsing, \u00a0The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins. Princeton University Press, 2015. allowed us to connect the field sites to our own lives, elsewhere. I would like to think such radical transcendence of time and space was made possible by the powerful energy generated as a result of this embodied and emotive encounter with the Anthropocene. Through this, the story of a North American Anthropocene comes to have wider resonance with a billion local stories of the Anthropocene. This is perhaps the message conveyed in the song of Wendi Moore-O\u2019Neal, a local cultural worker and activist, later in the afternoon. The song ended with these words: \u201c\u2026I am taking my mama to your relative.\u201d We are connecting the story of New Orleans to our own stories of the Anthropocene.

Once we were settled into one of workshop sessions at a location along Cancer Alley in southeastern Louisiana, we began a discussion about the activities for the afternoon. We presented to the group\u2014consisting of activists, artists, community organizers, and academics\u2014the primary needs assessment presented to us by our co-organizer LEAN. The environmental justice non-profit are based in Baton Rouge, not far from where we met that day. This needs assessment was developed by LEAN through hundreds of conversations with community leaders and residents from communities where the organization works each and every day. These community members asked LEAN to ask us for a \u201cletter of support\u201d\u2014one that would come from all of the regional, national, and global professionals who were participating in this Risk/Equity seminar, as part of the Anthropocene River Campus. Within our particular letter writing \u201cbreakout\u201d group, we focused on creating an outline for the letter by fleshing out the details with the hope of producing a draft before the end of the day. To do this, we passed out a handout with some preliminary ideas about how to proceed. Immediately, a hand went up, and the participant asked, pointedly: \u201cThis seems incredibly patronizing, egotistical, and, quite honestly, something that I don\u2019t want to participate in.\u201d One of my co-organizers leaned over to me and said, \u201cHere we go.\u201d Initially upset, I was more than a bit hurt. To be challenged for not only my positionality and my own connections to these communities is one thing, but I was also deeply irritated (read: \u201cangry\u201d) the questioning of the deep-rooted, decades long relationships that our co-organizers from LEAN have cultivated and fostered over the previous forty years with these residents living along the Mississippi industrial river corridor. Marylee Orr, LEAN\u2019s co-founder and current executive director, and Wilma Subra, LEAN\u2019s chief technical scientist, have been working on EJ issues since the early 1980s (and for Wilma, even before the 1980s), during the \u201cbirth\u201d of the EJ movement in Louisiana (which coincided with the birth of EJ concerns nationally). Michael Orr, LEAN\u2019s communications director, is Marylee\u2019s son, and\u2014as Marylee points out when describing the founding of LEAN\u2014he was the catalyst for Marylee\u2019s involvement in the environmental justice movement. Questioning the sincerity and integrity of the relationships between LEAN\u2019s staff and the Cancer Alley communities smacked of its own kind of arrogance, and coming from an uninformed position, as anyone who has read about, or spent any time working within Cancer Alley, would know the important historical and on-going commitment of LEAN and its staff. It took a moment for us to regroup and consider the statement more concretely, one which we had considered might surface during the seminar\u2019s activities. But one which we did not expect to come so harshly and directly\u2014nor so early in the process. During the course of the planning of this event, we had very much considered issues of how we could do \u201ccommunity engagement work\u201d at a distance and, in some cases, across continents. The difficulties associated with doing something that is significantly, and importantly, context-based and built around sustained, personal relationships, can make any attempt to do this from afar run the risk of being, at best, ineffective, and potentially damaging, at worst. We had attempted to create a process to both protect the time of local communities, who are often taxed by the amount of energy it takes to connect them to outside researchers (and especially to do so concretely), and yet also to try ensure some form of \u201cdirect engagement\u201d with these local communities. To do this, we worked directly through my existing connection to LEAN, who I have worked with nearly weekly over the past six years. The crucial element within this framework is LEAN\u2019s established relationships, as an EJ advocacy organization with a long-standing, close connections to these communities through on-going working relationships. In returning to the \u201cbreakout\u201d session, Michael Orr responded to these developing tensions by stating emphatically, \u201cWe are doing THIS [the \u201cbreakout\u201d group workshop] exactly because we do not want to interject this group into these communities.\u201d Then, after a few more tense moments, we got to the work of how to concretely, yet thoughtfully, proceed. As the room was filled with community activists and organizers, with years of experience in doing community engaged \u201cwork\u201d in various forms, some of them were able to take the lead. Others, including the artists and academics, added their own voices to the discussion. After some time, we developed a schematic of whom we should address the letter, and what would be the exact content and wording. The consensus was that we would write a \u201cthank you\u201d letter to all of the community leaders, activists, advocates, and residents who work tirelessly each and every day to support these EJ communities. We all agreed that \u201cfighting injustices\u201d is exhausting, and often thankless but, most significantly, never-ending. But given that these injustices have real, material consequences\u2014in the form of illnesses and premature deaths\u2014efforts to fight injustice can neither be abandoned nor denied. In the end, these activities were also part of a larger an effort within the Anthropocene River Campus to rethink issues of scale, scope, and connectivity in the face of broad global changes to the environment (e.g., climate change, rising sea levels, industrial production of chemicals, plastics, and related products, the international movement of pollution and waste, etc.) and their connections to regional and local issues and impacts (e.g., coastal land loss, air, water, and soil contamination by industry, waste disposal and localized pollution, etc.).\u00a0Understanding, but also embracing and utilizing, that issue of scale and scope, as it relates to, and possibly enhances, connectivity is crucially important. Scale and scope, in terms of this connectivity understood as not solely geographic, allows for new opportunities to fight injustices. And while these injustices may have global, national, and regional roots, they must be identified, challenged, and fought locally. However, this does not preclude the importance of scaling up the scope of our collective efforts, by tapping into national and global networks of activists and advocates and using this rethinking of scale as a method to fight environmental injustices. For us, this was (and continues to be) the crucial moment of release to get us past the uncomfortable, and yet necessary, tensions regarding issues of voice and authenticity associated with community engagement work among environmental justice communities throughout Louisiana and around the world. Hopefully, this is just one step in an arduous yet fruitful process of rethinking these relationships and our individual and collective contributions to fighting injustices.

I was no more \u201calone with my thoughts\u201d in a bus full of academics, activists and artists from across the United States, Europe, and Asia as I am now, sharing a \u201croom of my own\u201d with both immediate and extended family members that are working and learning from my home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The two days of engagement and exposition I co-organized with local and non-local professors provided at once too much and too little time to process my place in the Anthropocene River Campus let alone my precarity as a Black, Latinx woman living in the Anthropocene. Bumper-to-bumper traffic between \u201cCancer Alley\u201d and New Orleans offered just enough time, however, to reflect on the contemporary artist Dread Scott and many others who traveled this River Road before me as \u201cconveners\u201d of conversation, critical thinking, speculative thought and collaborative action about racialized risk\u2014of life and death\u2014in the lower Mississippi River Delta. The seminar, as I envisioned it, made space for new inquiries and interventions\u2014speculative fictions\u2014to join innumerable others envisioning rights amidst disenfranchisement, wellness despite endangerment, value in spite of impoverishment and joy at the center of desolation. Black clergy and other culture bearers of New Orleans who have shared the most joyous and tragic moments of deltaic life understandably mocked the mere idea of facilitating or contributing to a seminar on racial equity in the Anthropocene, a period of Earth\u2019s life and that of the world when Black people die as Blackness thrives. LEAN and Stop the Industrial Lock Expansion, just two of many institutions that presently fight for Black futures in the lower Mississippi River, expertly exposed us to these dualities of living with toxicity in the past, present and future. With the aid of scientific community members and community engaged scientists, the communities of Reserve, LA and the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans have managed to endure and evade environmental, commercial, industrial, and political violence waged against both Blackness and poorness at a distance from the Mississippi River levees their ancestors built to safeguard the places they call home. Well beyond the Industrial Canal, the Bonne Carr\u00e9 Spillway in Baton Rouge and Washington, D.C., state and federal policy makers decide the fate of Jim Crow urbanism\u2014whether another petrochemical plant\u2019s request to expand production earns approval or another canal expansion receives financial and political investment to proceed over the objections of citizen scientists. Leadership of the Lower 9th Center for Sustainable Environmental Development and LEAN\u2014replete with activists \u201cborn and bred\u201d in these toxic landscapes\u2014refuse to let any place deliver a death sentence for communities without a fight. There would be as many books and films on Cancer Alley as there are vides of New Orleans post-Katrina if challenges and opportunities, triumphs and tragedies in the fight for Black lives were documented and processed by the traditional but costly protocols historians prefer. As the Risk/Equity seminar contemplated alternatives, a critical question arose: is there any archive \u201cform\u201d or \u201cmedia\u201d that will affirm the elasticity and authenticity of community activism while advancing the education, litigation, and investigations of community members? Swept up by the design challenge, I nearly forgot to exercise a principle of my own design pedagogy: study the site and listen to the client but also mine the memories of people who have and will engage in the placemaking or placekeeping you plan. The most traditional resource of a formal archive\u2014a \u201cfinding aid\u201d\u2014best captures what I and many trained historians initially strived for, and sped towards, as we transitioned from outside to inside Cancer Alley community through a series of convenings. An artist who\u2019d participated in and convened the filmic version of a hack-a-thon pulled me out of the trance of my training and prompted the question: What\u2019s more of a \u201clife hack\u201d than Black filmmaking that casts equity in place and out of place in the Anthropocene? We had, after all, walked the path of Spike Lee\u2019s film crews and others who descended on the Lower 9th Ward after Hurricane Katrina and Gulf waters broke open the levee walls protecting and segregating a bastion of historically African American homeownership in New Orleans. I reflected on Queen and Slim, a film produced partially from atop the Industrial Canal levee walls that will be extended into the Lower 9th neighborhood if petrochemical lobbyists, port economists and water engineers overpower citizens and the science behind the Stop the Locks campaign. Like HBO\u2019s hit show Treme, the recent film captured not only film tax credits that diversify south Louisiana\u2019s economy beyond oil, gas, plastics and tourism; the highly stylized portrayal of Black love on the run calls into question whether its ever had a place in America that wasn\u2019t built to degrade or destroy it. We then witnessed showpieces of the slow disasters that have unfolded over generations like episodes of the PBS television series Roots, which brought both the prayerful futurism and tragic futures of formerly enslaved families out of Deep South margins into mainstream media of the 1970s. By the end of the two-day seminar, I rejoiced in recognizing scenes of Queen Sugar, Ava Durvenay\u2019s contemporary exploration of rural black life in south Louisiana.",

For novice readers of their Black geographies in the past, present, and future, these documentaries illustrate the toxicity of people, property, and policy that makes measuring and managing toxic land, air, water a systemic practice of Black people. In creating these films expressly for allies and stakeholders such as participants in the Risk/Equity seminar, LEAN, Citizens United to Stop the Lock and the Louisiana Landmarks Society not only modeled low-carbon, high-impact alternatives to the Anthropocene River Campus. Sharing how, when, and with whom they produced these films, the citizen scientists of the lower Mississippi River also demonstrated how to convene thinkers and assemble doers for whom Black lives matter without siphoning considerably the time, spaces, and resources from individual activists and collective activism, locally and globally. In other words, I learned from LEAN to reprioritize the livability of Black people (myself, included) over the legibility of Black places, problems, and politics for publics just learning where and how Black lives matter. Can any public pedagogy of Black Lives Matter\u2014of which I would include the Risk/Equity seminar of the Anthropocene River Campus\u2014abolish epistemologies and pedagogies of the Anthropocenic Age? With public acknowledgement of Black lives increasingly taking the form of seminars, syllabi, and other forms of shared knowledge, I find myself increasingly pessimistic. More often than ever, I am called upon to serve as a digital archivist, storyteller, and narrator of Black experiences that are neither present nor accounted for in histories of and plans for the built environment. The communities of the Lower 9th Ward and Cancer Alley long ago learned, however, that such public scholarship and education can cultivate collective action against toxicity even before understanding of environmental racism takes place.

What advisories\u2014and epistemologies of risk\u2014do the world\u2019s Black geographies offer archivists, analysts, and activists of the Anthropocene? A lot. Far more than a paragraph or even an essay can do justice, given an entire academic field of study has emerged around Black matters and mattering.

Controlling the river\u2019s unruliness is an ongoing project\u2014one that is only ever partially successful. Taking that unruliness as a starting point, the essay resists a single, straightforward narrative path; rather, following the dynamics of the river itself, it meanders, shifts, and converges with other elements and stories along the way.

It sticks to the rims of water bottles. In the mornings, it slinks into the pools of sunscreen we pour into our open palms, then travels over faces and shoulders and knees. At night, sand ducks into the corners of our tents and never leaves. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are troubled by sand, too. On a stretch of the Upper Mississippi just south of Minneapolis, we canoe by a hydrographic survey boat used by the Corps. It\u2019s a black and white vessel, with thin metal arms on either side that drop down into the water, taking measurements of the river\u2019s bottom. Another time, we see one of their dredging boats, slowly scraping away to clear the channel of sediment. On a normal day, the mighty alluvial river carries an average 400 million tons of silt, sand, gravel, and clay downstream. In June 2019, intense flooding brought even more sediment than usual into the mix. The Corps are constantly working to fulfill their constitutional mandate to keep the nine-foot channel clear, so that barge traffic can continue unabated. The barges provoke a kind of fearful awe: the industrial sublime. From a safe distance, we watch them churn the water as they pass by, transporting goods up and down the channel. Sometimes we try to guess at what\u2019s inside. Grain is usually a good bet. Coal is an easy one; it\u2019s left uncovered, exposed to the elements. Oil, chemicals, and liquid fertilizer are contained in pipes and barrels. We pass one carrying long, glistening metal blades, laid flat and packed side by side. They look like fangs taken from the mouth of a giant animal. We can\u2019t figure out what they could be. Finally someone hits on it: \u201cWind turbines!\u201d",

Together, these navigational buoys form the boundary lines demarcating either side of the 9 foot channel. Or at least that\u2019s the idea. But, as it turns out, the Corps has to constantly wrangle the buoys to keep them in place. When it floods, they can cut loose entirely, drifting and bobbing their way into places where they shouldn\u2019t be. On one of the islands where we camp near Prairie Du Rocher, Illinois, we find a green can that has run aground and gotten stuck in a pile of driftwood.

This was one of the species native to the Upper Mississippi that was prized by settler colonialists around the turn of the twentieth century, who heavily harvested the bivalves to make mother-of-pearl buttons and pins. Higgins\u2019 eyes thrive in free-flowing, deep, clean water. The constant dredging, plus the lock and dam system, have made it difficult for the mussels to bed, to reproduce, and to grow. And because mussels are filter-feeders, they are especially sensitive to the municipal, industrial, and agriculture runoff that pollutes the river. Ironically, if their numbers were greater, mussels could help to reverse these exact processes that make it impossible for them to thrive. Not only do they clean water of chemicals and heavy metals, but they help to maintain the integrity of the riverbed by forming a kind of coral system, which in turn supports microorganisms that feed fish, otters, turtles, and other creatures. As we canoe down the river, I think about the ghosts of these past ecosystems. I think about a future where they are thriving. I think about how, when a grain of sand or other rogue element makes its way inside the shell of a freshwater mussel, the mollusk goes into defense mode. It starts to coat the intruder with a mineral-rich, iridescent liquid called nacre. Layer upon layer of nacre is what forms a pearl. Dune The sand dredged by the Corps gets dumped onto artificial islands, where we camp at night. One of the islands where we stop, somewhere in between Minnesota and Wisconsin, is piled so high and so steep with fresh sand that it\u2019s become a dune.

The river runs through the Kushiro-Shitsugen National Park, one of the largest wetland areas in Japan. Starting in the early 1980s, the Kushiro, like so many waterways, was straightened out. Levees were put in place to prevent flooding in the nearby farmlands. Similar to the Mississippi, once the Kushiro River was channelized, unintended consequences quickly followed: the wetlands started to dry up. Nutrient and sediment loads were no longer being filtered through the marshes, so populations of native fish and bird species started to decline as their downstream habitats disappeared or became unlivable. One of the most disturbing losses was the decline of the tancho, the graceful red-crowned crane, an auspicious symbol of wisdom and longevity in Japanese art and literature and a sacred god for the Indigenous Ainu people. This wasn\u2019t the first time that the tancho had seen a devastating decline. Once found all over the archipelago, by the early twentieth century, the non-migratory population of tancho was thought to have gone extinct in Japan, due to overhunting and habitat loss.

Then, in the 1920s, a group of around twenty birds was found living in the Kushiro marshlands. The small population held on until the 1950s, when the cranes and their habitat were declared a \u201cspecial natural monument\u201d of Japan and conservation efforts were put in place. Nearby farmers were enlisted to feed the cranes, using corn subsidized by the government. The plan worked; the population of tancho grew to over 1,000.",

I grew up near the Wabash River\u2014a tributary to the Ohio River, which meets the Mississippi just south of St. Louis. The resemblances between Hokkaido and the Midwestern United States are intentional; when the Japanese state colonized Hokkaido in 1869, they followed settler colonial tactics that they learned on visits to the United States. They dispossessed Indigenous Ainu communities of their land and hired American experts in agriculture, engineering, and botany to form the Sapporo Agricultural College. Instead of crops like rice and sweet potato, which are grown in other parts of Japan, Hokkaido became known for milk, cheese, and corn. I\u2019m surprised to find myself thinking of this history so often during my time on the Upper Mississippi. But it\u2019s because they are the same settler colonial landscapes, recreated by the same violent, extractive processes. As we leave the Driftless region and get closer to the Quad Cities, it\u2019s all cornfields and dairy farms, stretching out as far as the eye can see.",

They were trying to undo some of the damage they had done to the wetlands, by \u201cremeandering\u201d the river\u2014the first project of its kind in Asia. Following new legislation passed in 2003, the government had restored a back channel that had been cut off and reconnected it to the main channel. The officials told us that they were on the way to recreating floodplain conditions and restoring the wetlands.

Crane populations were holding steady, but they remained critically endangered. Even with the remeandering efforts, their overall habitat was still shrinking, due to continued deforestation and urban development. The cattle and corn farmers still came out every day to throw handfuls of grain into the fields for them to eat. What does it mean to belong in or to a river system like the Kushiro, or the Mississippi? Processes of settler colonialism, hydrologic engineering, resource extraction, and industrial agriculture have irrevocably changed the course and character of these rivers\u2014hemming them in on all sides, directing where and how they flow, enabling certain forms of life while rendering others precarious or impossible. In places layered with violent histories of dispossession, relocation, and contamination, it\u2019s not always clear what counts as a rogue element. Postscript At the very start of the trip, before I even stepped into a canoe, I came to Wita Tanka, or Pike Island, at the confluence of the Mississippi and the Minnesota rivers. This area, known as Bdote, is sacred land for the Dakota people: the place where the world began. It is also a place of great suffering, where Dakota people were rounded up and held in a concentration camp by U.S. military forces at Fort Snelling during the Dakota-U.S. War of 1862, before being forcibly removed from Minnesota. That day when we visited, the ground was still soft from the water that inundated the island earlier in the year. Some sections were covered in new growth, while other areas remained thick with mud, the roots of upturned, water-logged trees hanging in the air. I was still getting to know everyone who was making the journey. As we chatted and made our way along the trail, we stopped to look at graffiti and to collect bits of trash that had washed ashore.",

It was pointed on both ends. Why would a beaver create something like that? \u201cIt\u2019s a sculpture,\u201d someone declared. We all laughed at the thought. But why couldn\u2019t a beaver be an artist? I picked up the piece of wood and cradled it in the crook of my arm. The trash we collected that day got thrown away once we returned to the Twin Cities. But I kept the sculpture as a companion for the rest of the trip. We named her \u201cThe Wild.\u201d As I write these words, The Wild sits near me on a shelf in my living room in Western Pennsylvania. Who knew that the time we spent together on the Mississippi River would seem so impossible just a few months later? All of that close contact, in canoes and tents and around campfires. All of those hours spent together: Eating, sleeping, talking, cooking, sloshing, carrying, observing, singing, rowing. Mississippi. An Anthropocene River \u00b7 Dig Dig Into The Water Looking back, I\u2019m nostalgic not only for the specific people and places, but the feeling of safety in being together, in close proximity with other human bodies. Imagine what it would have been like to wear masks that whole time\u2014how grimy they would have gotten, with rain and sweat and sand. I suppose we could have rinsed them out every night in the river, then hung them up on branches to dry, hoping they would not blow away by morning. COVID-19 is a rogue element. Jumping from body to body in tiny droplets of spit, the virus has completely disrupted normal patterns of life. Who knows what it will be like when the dust settles? People want to know: \u201cAre handshakes a thing of the past?\u201d \u201cWhat will it be like to kiss someone unfamiliar?\u201d \u201cCan I pet this dog?\u201d All of these are the same question: \u201cHow do I trust the world again?\u201d And within that, there\u2019s another one: \u201cHow do I trust that which is outside of myself?\u201d How did we ever? Our bodies have always been porous\u2014open to germs, to contaminants, to allergens, to parasites. This porosity is something that I have thought about a lot in my research, mostly in the context of the ongoing Fukushima nuclear disaster. Like the virus, radioactive contaminants are invisible. In the immediate aftermath of the nuclear explosions in Japan, the threat of radiation made people afraid of everyday objects that they had taken for granted before. The fruits, vegetables, and fish in the grocery store were suddenly threatening sponges for cesium in the soil. Even the air outside became suspect; people started to dry their laundry indoors, just in case. In the midst of a global pandemic, openness to the world can feel like a weakness. For those in power\u2014the state, the wealthy, the corporate giants\u2014uncertainty is threatening. This anxiety has been made all the more apparent in the midst of the Black Lives Matter uprisings in the United States, after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, not too far from the sacred confluence of waters at Bdote. These recent events remind us once again that the goal of those in power is maintenance of the status quo: the continuous flow of capital and the preservation of white supremacy. It is those in power who are clamoring for a return to normalcy. It is the same with the Mississippi River: retain the channel at its current depth of nine feet. Make sure the barges can keep moving their goods. Do not rock the boat. What if some rogue elements offer other possibilities, more just\u2014and more joyful\u2014ways of coexisting? The writer Rebecca Solnit, in A Paradise Built in Hell, contends that although our narratives of disasters tend to emphasize moments of chaos and grief, many people also express an exaggerated sense of well-being, meaningfulness, and connection in the trying times that follow a catastrophe. Solnit\u2019s point is not to romanticize disasters, but to understand how moments of disorder might allow us to see potentialities that are already there. \u201cThe possibility of paradise hovers on the cusp of coming into being, so much so that it takes powerful forces to keep such a paradise at bay,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf paradise now arises in hell, it\u2019s because in the suspension of the usual order and the failure of most systems, we are free to live and act another way.\u201d Rebecca Solnit, A Paradise Built in Hell (New York: Penguin Books, 2009), 7. Or, as the poet Masahide Mizuta, a disciple of the haiku master Basho, put it, after a devastating fire in 1688 that destroyed his home:In Lucien Stryk, ed., Zen Poetry: Let the Spring Breeze Enter, ed. and trans. Lucien Stryk and Takashi Ikemoto (New York: Grove Press, 1995). Barn\u2019s burnt down \u2013 now I can see the moon Towards the end of my month on the river, after carrying The Wild with me the entire way, I finally saw a beaver in the flesh. We had been seeing signs of them ever since we reached the St. Louis area and got past the lock and dams, where the river starts to flow more freely. The islands around there, thick with willow trees, are a beaver paradise. All night long, we heard them slapping their stiff tails on the surface of the water, making their disdain for our presence known. Then, late one night, we were sitting on the shore when we noticed something small bobbing out in the water, maybe ten feet away. It was the head of a beaver. He was floating on his back, enjoying the moonlight.",

We were guided to a spot along the East side of the Middle Fork by Andrew Rehn, a Water Resources Engineer with Prairie Rivers Network. Our goal was to consider the geologic and biological forces that produced coal in Central Illinois, in relationship to the settler-colonial society that began extracting it in the 20th Century and the ongoing consequences of that extraction in political-ecological terms. One of the places where we could see this relationship up close is along a windy stretch of the Middle Fork River. Here, we could see a set of facilities used to store coal ash, along with the inability of those facilities to prevent the ash from entering the surrounding ecosystem.

Opening Game\u2014Discipline Snap: Delegates formed pairs to play \u201cDiscipline Snap,\u201d a game that involved participants calling out \u201cSnap\u201d while holding imaginary cards in the air. In the first round, the subject was numbers, in the second academic disciplines, and the third subject was stakeholders or other potential knowledge-bearers. If a matching number, discipline, or stakeholder was called out, the colleague who called out \u201cSnap\u201d first was the winner. Discipline Slam: Each participant was given one minute to describe the academic discipline(s), profession, or knowledge community to which they felt they belonged, and to indicate its relevance to the Anthropocene. Even though participants had been trained in different disciplinary realms, many shared similar research questions, methods, and preferred readings. Some observed, in fact, that there seemed to be more in common between Campus participants than those of many other, more discipline-focused conferences. Introductory Lecture I: Bronislaw Szerszynski\u2019s introductory lecture put forward the possible dimensions of interdisciplinarity, which is formed from different degrees of interdisciplinary integration across and beyond disciplines, various practices of interdisciplinarity as well as the various different goals and motivations of interdisciplinarity. The strength of interdisciplinarity lies in the fact it can be creatively agonistic between forms of knowledge and thereby serve to disrupt ontological objects of knowledge. Szerszynski suggested that it was necessary to distinguish between forms of knowledge, explicit or tacit, individual or collective, and that this division formed the basis for Alice Lam\u2019s typology of embrained, encoded, embodied, and embedded knowledge. The processes of knowledge transformation were considered through the work of Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi: the externalization that turns tacit into explicit knowledge; the combination of forms of explicit knowledge; the internalization involved in learning through doing, thus giving explicit knowledge a tacit dimension; the socialization of individually-held tacit knowledge through field-building. Introductory lecture II: Mark Lawrence\u2019s lecture looked at interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity with reference to climate geoengineering. In the context of anthropogenic climate change and historical attempts at controlling the weather, various techniques have been proposed, including removal of carbon dioxide on land and at sea, and planetary albedo modification. Toward this aim, different academic disciplines have been involved in climate geoengineering research (from the physical sciences and engineering, to political science and philosophy) and, in addition, wider societal issues, such as governance and ethics, have come to the fore. Experiential learning game \u2013 Performing Burning Issues: In the first round of the Learning Game, one person\u2019s opening statement was followed by someone else\u2019s response that began \u201cNo! But \u2026\u201d before their own opinions and ideas as alternatives were offered. In the second round, the same format was used, but now the responder began \u201cYes! And \u2026\u201d before they presented their own ideas, complementary to the other person\u2019s statement. In the third round, each participant again began \u201cYes! And \u2026\u201d although now a physical response was required. Now the responder had to act out his or her idea by striking a frozen pose, which was meant to connect in some way to the poses struck by earlier participants, resulting in a collective human-concept \u201csculpture.\u201d Group Work: Compassion and connectedness \u2013 on how to connect to the fate of individuals; Practices of the self \u2013 Molly \u2013 about a molecule and its journey; Creative experiments \u2013 developing an archive and web platform that allows users to navigate through diverse narratives of matter; Sharing \u2013 focusing on Haiti\u2019s journey from independent utopia to dystopia; \u2022 Radical education reform \u2013 looking at the school as a microcosm of the planet; Wrapping it All Up: Participants questioned the dominance of the interdisciplinarity approach, which is seen as a precondition to better problem solving (the logic of integration). Delegates reflected on how to situate knowledge if the Anthropocene is approached as an entanglement that we are in, rather than as a problem to solve. Perhaps what the Anthropocene does is force us to recognize that disciplinary knowledge is less about the world than in the world; that it participates in the world\u2019s becoming. Hence, working across disciplines can be a means by which to achieve greater knowledge, especially if it helps to cultivate friction between disciplines rather than to integrate them. In this way, disciplinarities promote comparing incommensurable things, so that categories are questioned, rather than simply compiled as data. One approach that made use of creative experiments as radically interdisciplinary modes of research is described in the essay &#8220;Feeling/Following&#8220;.",

The multiple instructors brought to the table backgrounds in fields including biology, economics, literature, design, computer science, critical theory, and media studies.

                "text": "After being introduced to the main concepts and discussions, the students broke into smaller groups that developed \u201cdisaster apps,\u201d defined as imaginary apps that produce or stave off future catastrophes through algorithmic intermediation. Instructors suggested that the groups should \u201cBe Evil!\u201d (a play on Google\u2019s motto \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d), meaning that groups should seriously consider the deleterious consequences that would follow from introducing smartness ubiquitously, and should not shy away from the potentially inhuman results. Another instructor explained this imperative by suggesting that rather than circumventing the deleterious consequences of a smart world, imaginary disaster apps should attempt to \u201cgo through\u201d the world of smartness and come out the other side. Teams were encouraged to draw broadly on the diverse expertise of group members to produce the most imaginative and evocative applications. From among the results of these projects, a selection of three are presented here. The report on \u201cKAIROS Earthquake Early Warning Application\u201d by Svenja Sch\u00fcffler is a literary and technical investigation of the potential to design automated smart systems to detect earthquakes and warn the citizenry in advance of disasters. Equipped with \u201cinnumerable sensory devices and objects found underground and on the surface [\u2026] MEMS accelerometers, cameras, RFIDs, and GPS,\u201d the proposed &#8220;KAIROS&#8221; system imagines the introduction of smart sensing technology into future megacities to forestall environmental catastrophes before they arrive. By contrast, \u201cCANARY TM\u201d imagines the installation of singing, canary-like voices throughout a city whose purpose would be reminiscent of the \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d whose death signalled a threat to human miners. &#8220;CANARY TM&#8221; imagines the introduction of such canaries on a (mega)citywide scale, based on equipping cities with speakers whose melodic chirping apprises residents of the environmental safety of the city. Finally, \u201cI prefer not to\u201d offers a critical and performative record of refusal to accept the parameters of the intermediated smart world. Comprising the stark, rudimentary documents of the responses made by the class to a group that refused to accept the parameters of the assignment, it queries how humans respond to the radical withdrawal of the technological and technocratic imperatives of the intermediated world. Each of these projects (as well as other projects not included here as they remain in draft form) join philosophical and practical elements together. On the one hand, these disaster apps aim at imagining the kind of needs and challenges that might confront the technosphere in which we are destined to live. Following the principles of the \u201csmart mandate\u201d outlined by the instructors, these apps endeavour to understand how the future management of life might proceed in circumstances where the prospect of environmental destruction overshadows all of living experience. However, there is also an existential aspect to these apps\u2014an exploration of the mentalities and sensibilities that would pervade such a world, and where the human being locates itself in the technospheric landscape. Thus, each of these apps also grapples with ethical, affective, and aesthetic features of a future smart world. By employing exposition, visuals, multimedia, and audio, these apps imagine responses that go beyond technicity and automatisms. Four proposed projects for continued development also spring from the seminar. Olivier Hamant has launched a project on the study of \u201csuboptimalism,\u201d informed by the contributions of members from the seminar. An early manifesto from that project will be delivered to the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) by Dr. Hamant. In addition, Juan Suarez of the Red Cross developed an idea for an app that would \u201cgamify\u201d the prediction and warning of flood systems. Efforts are being made to explore possible applications of this work. Finally, the \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d group is preparing an artwork and performance that more fully investigates the themes outlined above. Another participant in the seminar has approached members of the HKW to discuss the prospect of implementing an automated analysis of the audio recordings from the seminar, with the goal of producing a glossary for better understanding its key concepts. This proposal is under consideration by the HKW. By way of reflection, participants in the seminar identified a number of areas and questions that might be helpful to direct future efforts, in order to develop these ideas in greater detail. One member of the discussion remarked that, in the case of some projects\u2014for example, the \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d\u2014there were challenges in understanding how artistic intervention concretely engages the technological problems of the seminar. Future seminars of this sort would benefit from a more sustained engagement with the bridge between aesthetic and technical investigation, as well as reflection on what group members owe to the seminar in terms of making constructive contributions that are intelligible to a wide range of participants. Another question raised by seminar participants was how best to integrate the different types of knowledge brought to the seminar by the instructors. On the one hand, there was the concept of intermediation animating much of the course, and, in many respects, this concept borrowed from biology and related fields to discuss how it is that complexity and other problems in the technosphere may be managed. On the other hand, the concept of smartness, which was defined more in alignment with ideas drawn from design, critical theory, and their related fields. The different slants to these concepts reflects the different backgrounds of the instructors. Implicitly, this animated much of the work and discussion. Whether these ideas are best kept in tension, or whether it would have been better to have them fully integrated in advance, remains an open question. Some seminar participants saw in the \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d intervention an allegory of the violence of data that reflects on the style of the campus. A number of participants did not realize that they were being recorded at all times before this intervention made clear the technospheric operations of the seminar space. A number of participants expressed unease with the fact that many of their ideas could not be expressed completely freely when they were being recorded. In future seminars, some of the participants would prefer a format that does not record conversations, in order to encourage a freer, less self-conscious dialogue.",

        "abstract": "The Anthropocene can be neither untangled nor scaled down from its complex multilayered composition. Pertinent for the Anthropocene are large- and small-scale features; an anthropogenic landscape is qualified, at the same time, by its peculiar location, its history, its ecological context, population, and geological substrates, and by the chemical composition of its soil, the altered nitrogen cycle, and the local disappearance of water. Therefore, the investigation of a landscape in the Anthropocene requires a multidimensional and multi-temporal vision, which means the simultaneous activation of dissimilar research perspectives converging to assemble a new way of perceiving. In this seminar, we tried to keep such perspectives both simultaneously activated and open to the possibility of working jointly.",

                "text": "The \u201cnew knowledge needed\u201d may emerge from the bordering, conflicting areas between well-established research disciplines; borders between disciplines, viewed as the transition of phase spaces, are discontinuous fields with an open topology, more adequately dealt with through a variety of superposed and homogeneous metrics. In this seminar, participants were seen as owners of specific metrics, both disciplinary and cultural, that needed to be part of the network and to become part of the dialogue. The Berlin landscape was our connecting ground. In our local Anthropocene ethnographic experience in the Lichtenberg district, we tried to connect local and global, past and future, community and world system. Our goal was to bring the global down to a human dimension\u2014to experience it as a neighborhood and as a landscape\u2014and to observe the global-geologic sedimented history of our selected landscape while simultaneously seizing the long-term consequences of short-term events and local behaviors. As a preparatory task, participants were asked to select an \u201cindividual case study\u201d representing their vision of an anthropogenic landscape, showing evidence of long-term transformation enacted by social and environmental processes relevant to the Anthropocene in some way, which they were asked to document and support in terms of socio-cultural, economic, ecological, and geological evidence. As a second step, participants were asked to select a specific perspective to investigate and describe their own case study, a conceptual crosscut through the multiplicity of entangled meanings that constitute the anthropocenic relevance of their selected examples. We called this selected perspective a \u201cconceptual tool,\u201d and the aim was to use it in an attempt at a focalized understanding of the seminar\u2019s main case study. Finally, the fieldwork: a short but intense external tour brought the participants to explore, experience, interview/record, and touch the reality of the former VEB Elektrokohle Lichtenberg site. Initially established in the predominantly agricultural district of Lichtenberg, just outside the city limits of Berlin, it was then taken over by the Siemens company\u2014a synonym for Germany\u2019s rapid growth during the Industrial Revolution. The area was used as a socialist manufacturing plant by VEB Elektrokohle during the era of the German Democratic Republic (GDR, 1949\u201290). Today, the highly contaminated site is characterized by two concrete towers\u2014all that remains of VEB Elektrokohle after its demolition\u2014and by the Dong Xuan Center, a shopping district mainly catering to the Berlin-based Vietnamese community. Vietnamese workers were invited to Berlin in the framework of long-term programs of workforce training and exchange that existed between the GDR and Vietnam in the 1970s and 1980s. The community remaining in Berlin after unification continued to grow, and developed peculiar strategies to appropriate and transform the former industrial site, mediating between legal, economic, identity, and environmental issues. A theoretical driver provided by ecology to seize the relevance of the Vietnamese community in transforming the former industrial space is the \u201cniche-construction\u201d process. We wanted to read the Lichtenberg district in its multiplicity of anthropocenic meanings, landscape potential, and niche-construction effects. While anthropocenic issues in general demand large spatial and temporal perspectives, we selected a rather narrow example: our case study focused on an area in a specific district of Berlin, a relevant but not a crucial or vital case. Why select a small-scale example? Is it a productive choice? Is small-scale a synonym of an easier scale? And/or is it a synonym of a faster transformative process, somehow perceived as an easier process to grasp? Scales decide the meaning and the reliability of models: we asked whether the study of small-scale examples can help to construct larger pictures, and what the larger impact of an \u201cecological niche\u201d like ours might be: Does Berlin as a cultural context affect and feed back the relevance of a small-scale experiment? Finally, can a small-scale example be easier to study while at the same time be highly instructive? In answering all of these points, the seminar was a successful challenge. Groups of randomly assembled participants explored the former VEB site in Lichtenberg, wandering through the remains of the industrial plant, the Vietnamese covered market, the Pakistani restaurants, the \u201cswimming pool\u201d construction site, and the hills of debris seeded with cotton. Groups pursued different observational goals: some planned according to the conceptual network of tools commonly discussed, and others assembled new gazes negotiated with the unexpected. Information was gathered by following improvised or well-trained informants we met on site, collections of multiple recordings took shape in the form of videos, photos, sound, objects, impressions, and (un)pleasant emotions.",

                "text": "Despite the stark differences in the examples and case studies employed, some common threads emerged that underpin how the Anthropocene concept can be filtered as it permeates through the world of research into the broader context of humanity. The two introductory talks by instructors Marco Armiero and Amita Baviskar demonstrated just how disparate are the ways in which different groups within society view the Anthropocene. Marco Armiero explored the impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans, a city in the United States. The scientific perspective of the Anthropocene focuses on the fact that hurricanes are becoming more intense as the climate system warms, increasing the risk of catastrophic impacts. How people experience the impact, however, differs starkly depending on the wealth, power, and influence of different groups in New Orleans. This on-the-ground filtering greatly influenced the experiences of the residents of the city, who ranged from the wealthy who could protect their properties to the poor who lost everything, sometimes even their lives. Issues of power, influence, urban\u2012rural, poverty, and culture came out strongly in Amita Baviskar\u2019s scene-setter on the construction of the Sardar Sarovar gravity dam on the Narmada River in central India. The scientific filter tends to color the project favorably, because generating electricity hydroelectrically emits zero carbon dioxide and is seen as part of the solution for repairing the destabilizing climate. However, the question of who decides and who benefits from such a scheme strongly influences how various groups react to it\u2014again, it is the poorer and less powerful groups in society who suffer from even the well-meaning projects designed to deal with the Anthropocene. The case studies presented by the participants used various approaches to tease out how different individuals and groups across societies \u201cfilter\u201d\u2014that is, react differently to and are diversely affected by\u2014the Anthropocene. A common theme among all the case studies is that most people the world over will experience the Anthropocene as something that influences risks, constraints, and opportunities that already exist in their lives; indeed, many will be unaware that a shift in their planetary life-support system is now beginning to influence their everyday lives in a local fashion. Water, which is essential to life\u2014central to human cultures and livelihoods as it is to the natural world\u2014is now changing, everywhere, in very many ways, as the Anthropocene accelerates. Ice is melting, sea levels are rising, and it is raining harder more often. The patterns of liquid water across the landscapes of the planet and along the coastlines are changing. There is no better element to use than water for examining how people are filtering the Anthropocene. In many countries of the African continent, access to enough good-quality water has long been a challenge. The Anthropocene is exacerbating this problem in many regions. One case study focused on Lake Chad, a central feature in the livelihoods and economies of several countries that border the dwindling lake. Local and regional pressures have always been a challenge and have triggered adaptive strategies, but the new stress of diminishing rainfall in the Anthropocene is deepening this challenge. The Anthropocene is causing the opposite problem in the low-lying Maldive Islands south of the Indian subcontinent: too much water. Warming oceans and melting ice from far away are slowly inundating their homeland, posing an existential threat. Even here, however, filtering the Anthropocene is complex. Who is responsible for the Anthropocene? Is all of humanity to blame or only part of it? When did the Anthropocene start, and why? What is driving the Anthropocene? The final case study\u2014\u201cPlastic and Surrogacy\u201d\u2014is directed at the most fundamental and important features of human life: relationships and families. The technosphere, the feature of human societies that some would argue is the major driver of the Anthropocene, produces a wide range of novel entities\u2014chemicals, materials, and forms of energy that are new to the Earth system. One novel chemical type, \u201cendocrine disruptors,\u201d has the potential to wreak havoc on the human reproductive system. The implications of this are vast, and this fascinating case study is perhaps the most profound example of how we now have to filter the Anthropocene at the most fundamental level of our existence on the planet.",

As each new term was presented, the outer circle was asked to rotate clockwise so that each member was facing someone new for three minutes to discuss and write down the definition of the term. The exercise was crucial for reflecting on the use of terms, such as Earth, world, planet, forensics, and evidence, in scientific/political/legal forums. In a mapping workshop, participants attempted to identify and trace a series of geo-political lines across the globe. Mapping, as well as the architectural practice of drawing, brought complex narratives, scales, and multiple agents into each project. Two notable projects came about from the seminar. The geo-politics of the satellite Technosphere Since the Space Age, geo-politics has expanded into outer space. The tension this has created relates on the one hand to sovereignty and for what purposes space is used, e.g. whether military, civil, or commercial satellites, and on the other hand the notion of outer space as a commons \u201cfor all mankind\u201d and the subsequent pollution and production of space debris that has endangered this domain. By using the concept of the technosphere as theorized by Peter Haff and Jan Zalasiewicz, the written and visual work produced by seminar delegates mapped out the tensions of a \u201csatellite technosphere\u201d with its connections to geo-politics. Both the so-called space nations that are located primarily in the industrial North, and the launching facilities located near the equator, seen highlighted on a world map, are supplemented by an image of the Earth around which satellites and space debris are marked distinctively. In this sense, the technosphere is both the result of geo-politics among humans and its material consequence; together these create new challenges for legislation and regulation of space as a commons that could, plausibly, outlast human society itself. Visualizing the contributions to space debris orbiting the planet is a first step toward asking questions about a satellite\u2019s chain of production on Earth, the waste generated through assembly, and the regulations that control the use of outer space. While it is too early to speak of a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d for outer space, we are in a position to study the \u201cscramble for outer space\u201d as the major space nations carve up the remaining orbital positions between them. Anthropocene Insurance Corporation Who knows more about risk than an insurance company does? And who knows more about insurance companies than reinsurance companies do? This is the starting point for the fictional \u201ccould-soon-be-reality\u201d Anthropocene Insurance Corporation. Reinsurance is a massive global industry, capitalized to the sum of hundreds of billions of dollars, and led by firms like Willis, Berkshire Hathaway, Munich Re, and Swiss Re. Property-casualty insurers underwrite losses caused by the world\u2019s natural disasters and accidents\u2014from seasonal flooding to accidents involving automobiles. Reinsurance companies provide coverage to the insurance companies themselves, providing a basis of security, as well as an emerging investment market for those who would like to \u201ctake a chance\u201d on disaster. For example, take the new market in catastrophe bonds (CAT bonds). If it happens to be a year with few catastrophes, then the insurance industry makes a profit, and the bonds pay off. If something like Hurricane Katrina hits that year, however, the investor makes a loss. The Anthropocene Insurance Corporation (AIC) takes as its starting point the reinsurance industry of today, and imagines where it might be at some point in the not-too-distant future\u2014a time when the causes and effects of climate change bring the Anthropocene into sharp geo-political focus. Zones of risk spill across national boundaries in ways that defy national-level climate solutions; they place multinational corporations in a unique position of \u201cproblem-solving.\u201d To put it bluntly: investors tend to come from the center of global finance (mostly in the global North), while the most lucrative risk is in areas where climate change is predicted to soon put nations, insurance companies, farmers, and individual citizens on the knife edge of economic and personal survival (often the global South). The most promising products include drought insurance, CAT bonds, \u201cimmigration insurance\u201d (offering back-up in case climate change causes flooding or drought that leads to mass migration of populations from neighboring geographies into your own country), and wildfire catastrophe insurance. The AIC sees \u201cDrought Opportunity Zones\u201d where other insurance companies might see crop failures. Where some insurers see rising sea levels, we see submerged (but still valuable) properties\u2014people who need a little extra coverage to make sure they stay above water for one more year. The Anthropocene will be bad for many, but not for all. If our predictions are right (based on real, current, publicly accessible science and maps from 2015) you may be requiring a little extra (insurance) cover yourself sometime soon: the AIC is \u201cMonetizing Tomorrow\u2019s Risks Today.\u201d",

The concept of Slow Media builds on the idea of slow violence. The term was coined by Rob Nixon,Rob Nixon,\u00a0Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor.

In her reflection \u201cAlternatives to Global Challenges,\u201d Stella Veciana addresses the topic of destabilizing effects on long-standing concepts, narratives, and assumptions, while Anna \u00c5berg and Hugo Almeida focus on new perspectives on the Anthropocene that are revealed by other media such as \u201cComics and Graphic Novels.\u201d Helmuth Trischler\u2019s contribution describes an exemplary exhibition: \u201cInside the Museum: A Curator\u2019s View on the History of the Anthropocene\u201d demonstrates the exhibition architecture he curated. What would a \u201cMuseum Library\u201d look like in an imaginary museum that dedicates itself to the Slow Media practice? John Moran lists an exemplary network of vital categories. The imaginary museum opens up a speculative space for engaging, and reflecting on how to engage aesthetically with the Anthropocene, assembling different approaches from the arts and sciences. One imaginary example of addressing the Anthropocene is the project \u201cAnti Cyclones: A New Investment Paradigm\u201d by the Fair Weather Foundation, which offers a model merchandise of sustainable products.",

                "text": "In the seminar \u201cRomancing the Anthropocene\u201d we were challenged to use the anthropological concept of shadow to explore various dimensions of Von Chamisso\u2019s nineteenth-century novella, whose main actor, Peter Schlemihl, sells his shadow to a devilish creature, realizing afterwards that he has lost his human identity. In the shadowing methodology used in anthropology, the anthropologist puts herself in \u201csomeone else\u2019s shoes.\u201d Like a shadow, she sticks to the person she wants to analyze, in order to try to make sense of the world from the other\u2019s perspective. As historians, we tried to replicate this methodology within the framework of historical contextualism. We brought Peter Schlemihl from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first century in order to see the Westhafen world of 2016 \u201cthrough the eyes of a past actor\u201d\u2014that is, in Schlemihl\u2019s case, through the eyes of an expert naturalist who loved to observe, collect, and classify unknown species. By forcing the unknown \u201cspecies\u201d\u2014cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, plastic bags, waste, metal and stone animals, and so on\u2014into his nineteenth-century natural categories, Schlemihl identifies artifacts as natural beings (plants or animals). From the perspective of someone living in the twenty-first century, Schlemihl erases the boundaries between the natural and the artificial world. The new meanings he attributes to nature deeply invoke the anthropocenic blurring of the dichotomy between nature, artificial/nature and culture by questioning what is really natural in a world deeply (re)shaped by humankind, and simultaneously by naturalizing technology; in the process he endows its artifacts with a natural character. If we go a step further, we realize that not only do we see technology as natural, but we expect nature to behave as a technological artifact. A fitting example is the small child who plays with a tablet, dragging fishes with her finger. When confronted with fishes in an aquarium, she reproduces her finger\u2019s movements in order to control the movement of actual fishes, becoming surprised by her failure. In our seminar \u201cRomancing the Anthropocene,\u201d the concept of shadow acted as a quasi-object in Michel Serres\u2019 sense, as it forced us to adapt our own perspective on what we considered the \u201ccorrect\u201d approach to the Anthropocene, in a dynamic interaction where the shadow was used by us, but also \u201cused\u201d us. Thus, by being both object and subject, it strongly bordered Bruno Latour\u2019s concept of objects as \u201cactants.\u201d We hope to continue to develop this line of \u201calternative\u201d ontologies to discuss deeply and widely the relationship between the Anthropocene and the social sciences, particularly the history of science and technology.",

                "text": "Back in the twenty-first century, human societies worldwide became aware of the planetary network of co-evolutionary interdependencies and feedbacks connecting the social, technological, biological, and environmental spheres. Triggered by a highly improbable but critical incidence of mutation and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial species in New York and Hong Kong, global health services collapsed under a surge of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. This started a textbook-like chain, culminating in a mental transition in how humans perceived themselves in relation to their environment. It became unclear, even irrelevant, whether we considered the technosphere, including its engineered organisms, as our own extended phenotypes or whether we were, in fact, parts of the extended phenotypes of bacterial cells that exploited us to create nourishing, highly designed environments fostering their reproduction\u2014a M\u00f6bius band of entangled ideas and causal dependencies. Dialectical distinctions between humans and bacteria were dissolved into an undifferentiated anthropocenic nexus. It then became possible to ask new questions. Were micro-organisms responsible for causing global warming, environmental deterioration, and biodiversity loss of multicellular species? We did not know. We did not care. The city of Hong Kong was covered by a metallic sheet that glimmered in the light of the fading sun. Over the last few decades, nanoparticles of metal from the abandoned steel industries had been integrated in the matrix produced by the bacteria. This reinforced the fibers and the cellulose of a biofilm that formed sharp spikes reaching upward to the sky. It was impenetrable by most other organisms. On the edge of the rain forest in Asia, things were changing. Historically, population numbers in this area had been low and stress on the neighboring forest ecosystems was low. The population had been able to sustain itself on the resources that were local to the area. After decades of growth, the population exploded. This put stress on the local population and caused people in this area to go deeper into the forest to gather wild meat. By evolutionary chance, an animal that was hunted carried a strain of bacteria that this population had not encountered before. The bacteria passed from the hunted animal to the hunter and spread very rapidly among the human population through human networks of transportation, causing more disease and death. Somewhere, somehow, a letter was written.",

They had willingly sacrificed their mobility in the name of safety. At the prophets\u2019 instructions, the sterile buffers around the once-isolated production centers enclosed the center city. All past vulnerabilities had been sorted out: the bugs removed and the wilds tamed. The new center was believed to be perfect, but after that one uncalculated mutation, the realization came immediately. With the single breach, the prophets\u2019 calculations were immediately proven false. With the single breach, the inertia became irreversible. They watched it happen: the alarms sounded as waves of new, certainly deadly strains pulsed outward across the buffer, each solution serving to intensify and quicken the microbial advance toward the center. The solutions, whose rings were once symbols of the prophets\u2019 immense certainty, now marked each successive step closer to the end. The center\u2019s failure sparked a new collective reaction: with neither panic nor resignation, the people found themselves in an interminable ellipsis.

Not knowing that she had become a host for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, she visited her parents in their retirement home. One week later, several elderly people were reported to be displaying the symptoms of the infection: fever, sore throat, muscle pain, and headaches. Then, vomiting, diarrhea, and a rash followed, along with decreased liver and kidney function. Mr. Stock, aged seventy-one and already in poor health, is reported to have died after fifteen days. The German authorities put the retirement home under quarantine by fencing the house off from the surrounding neighborhood. The residents were delivered food, but were denied any medical or care assistance. Mrs Seidinger was also isolated for an unknown length of time from the city.

In the end, it was increasingly clear that all meaningful dialogue with microbial life had somehow been neglected. The Earth, after all, was always theirs. What we used to call antibiotic resistance appears to us now as more of an insistence on the primacy of life over death that we all fundamentally share in the deeper stratifications of our entangled genetic matter. Our fear of the mob, which characterized so much of our microbial imagination, seems now like an anachronistic story in the literary genre of apocalyptic fiction.

Even the sky itself seems alive, carrying its cargo of dust and strange degrees of self-replicating life around the world.

The plantation site had been claimed by the new East German government not long after the partition of the German state, and its original owner\u2014the forester who had imported and cultivated the Douglas firs and planted the trees\u2014was sent to a labor camp in Siberia for eleven years, for the crime of private land ownership. The land was then subdivided into smaller plots, each allocated to residents in the nearby township. However, these subplots were not large enough to provide any supportive means other than occasional firewood. Over this period, either the trees were left untouched, or the plots were stripped to fuel the coal ovens of the people to whom the land had been redistributed. Normally, plantation forest firs would be harvested at about seventy years. However, the traditional lifespan up to the harvesting of the trees at this site coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the handover of ownership of the land to a newly formed, unified German government. When the stewardship of this land was passed to the repatriated German state, the government was hesitant to harvest a site whose ownership was in dispute. The trees were left to grow, while the government adjudicated over the very human concern of property. As such, the trees that remained on site were granted a lifespan longer than the normally truncated life dictated by human industry. They have become \u201cwild.\u201d After reunification, the children of the original owner of the site sought to have the land returned to them; however, the attendant government, in all likelihood concerned with the costs associated with a difficult reunification process, decided not to grant their wish. The family therefore decided to purchase a smaller section of the original land, and continue the plantation ambitions that had so interested their forefathers. Mecklenburg traditionally was considered one of the poorer districts in Germany, and the reason for this is largely agricultural; the land cannot produce crops at the same rate as other German regions, and was used mostly for grazing cattle. This conception of Mecklenburg as \u201cpoor\u201d relates to land that is valued in terms of its utilitarian (agricultural) use only. Surrounding the site of the plantation are numerous wind farms, whose tall, white wind turbines now mark and redefine the landscape sonically and visually\u2014a repurposing and re-aestheticizing of the landscape for utilitarian purposes.   Plantations as wilds This forest site is a plantation\u2014and as such is a human intervention or construction. However, having been left untouched for over a century, the construction now appears as \u201cwald\u201d/\u201cwild,\u201d the clean geometry of its planting having been overtaken by the chaotic growth of an ecosystem vested only in preservation and propagation. This is a site whose apparent \u201cwildness\u201d was cultivated: a furious growth intended to serve human needs only, but whose foreseen utility political and economic intervention obfuscated. A tree plantation is a mildly confusing concept in relation to the preservation of ecological landscapes. Deforestation of \u201cold growth forests\u201d\u2014while not matched\u2014is at least paralleled by a rise in the cultivation of forest plantations. These plantations are becoming the new wilds, the new sites of plant growth\u2014now allied to a utilitarian and pragmatic design. Here, both \u201cforesters and futurists share a long range perspective&#8221;Bengston, David and Michael J. Dockry, \u201cForest futures in the Anthropocene: Can trees and humans survive together?,\u201d The Futurist, vol. 48, no. 4 (2014): pp. 34\u20139.\u2014an interest in the preservation of plant growth, because of man\u2019s interdependence upon it, and an ability to conceive of productive timespans longer than the individual human lifespan.   Sounding the landscape\u2014\u201cexplicitation\u201d of anthropogenic landscapes Ambient field recordings were made at the site\u2014an attempt to affectively listen to and make \u201caudible\u201d the immanent resonances of the site. Contact-microphone recordings of the trees that remained were also made, as a way of collecting a measure of their energetic resonance. This project\u2014as with much of my practice\u2014is vested in the idea of an \u201cexplicitation\u201d of the minor rhythms immanent to life that are occluded by its major, more hegemonic forms. These are the rhythms and resonances that rest within an anthropogenic landscape, but that require special, minor attention in order to access their affective potential. This is to argue for art\u2019s role in understanding the movements and transformations immanent to anthropogenic landscapes\u2014an art of explicitation that seeks to make visible the minor rhythms and resonances of which the landscape speaks. These forest recordings form part of a series of sound works produced in collaboration with Clara Jo, titled \u201cUntitled Sound Works, 1968\u20132014,\u201d which was exhibited at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin in November 2014, as part of the Festival of Future Nows.",

I guess for myself, I\u2019m just trying to think back to November when we were together during these two days, running this thing. What is it that we would like to regroup about? Adam: I think that helps, thinking about what would we like to regroup about? Monique Verdin: I have a prompt\u2014what site was most memorable for you? In our two-day journey, what was the place that stood out? Monica: How would you answer it, Monique? Monique: I was surprised that doing the listening exercise at Congo Square, that \u201ctuning in,\u201d and then standing in that circle and thinking of the significance of that place and the complexity\u2026 and [activist and researcher] Shana M. griffin speaking up and helping to expand upon it\u2014there was this sense of \u201cwe all have different backgrounds but we\u2019re all learning together.\u201d That was an important site for me. Monica: Yeah, the way Shana talked about it on multiple levels, from how when the sole of her foot touched the ground versus her shoe and what that felt like, and how that then brought her into talking about her own relationship to the history there, talking about multiple generations and her family. Monique: The specificity of that really matters.",

Matt Sakaeeny\u2019s voice and his expertise [as a researcher on music, race, and power] as well as Shana\u2019s. But it seemed to be that space, more so than others, where these individual voices really became a group. Monique: Something that stood out for me in a different kind of way than I have experienced before relates to disaster tourism and the aftermath of Katrina: I think that us moving through the space in these huge buses was really offensive. And I totally supported all the fisherman who flipped us off. There was this moment where I was just like, oh my god, is this environmental disaster tourism? What do the frontlines of the Anthropocene look like? And recognizing that this is an important place for us to learn from. That\u2019s thinking about the other seminars too, the idea of \u201coh, where just going to cruise through Cancer Alley!\u201d You know, what is that?",

                "text": "Monica: Let\u2019s talk about that for a little a bit. I think on the front end, I felt that I wanted to do this for really specific reasons: I wanted to work with you two, I thought that this could potentially be generative, it felt really important to do the work, to be thoughtful about how to do that, and if people from my own community were going to be involved, to be thoughtful about how that would look. I also felt anxiety around doing this for all the reasons you just mentioned, Monique. And then there were these varying degrees of like \u201cOh shit, and now we\u2019re going to have tour buses after all,\u201d things that I think we tried to break up. But then it happened, and we haven\u2019t really had a chance to talk about exactly what you bringing up Monique. Do you two want to talk about that a little, what felt good, what didn\u2019t? I don\u2019t know what this means going forward but I think it\u2019s worth talking about, because these kinds of activities will keep happening and what do I want my own relationship to be to it? Adam: When you were just talking about that, I was thinking about the nature of this enterprise over the past couple of years as being situated in these various places up and down the river and as much as the impetus was to read this river as a kind of unified body, the way that these exposure points and places reveal themselves is, I think, quite different, How we experience the Campus being located in New Orleans, I would argue, is much different to how St. Louis experienced it, or other locations upriver. So what does it mean to understand and express the specifics of place in terms of creating these points of exposure for multiple audiences participating, along with the citizens that live there? Monique: There\u2019s so many missed connections between up and down river\u2014the further south you go, the more disconnection there seems to be, right? I may be speaking without real understanding but it feels like that. I think that all of these places are vulnerable though. Caught between the vulnerable and desirable. The riverbank is really an uncertain territory. Monica: The disconnection comes out in different ways and of course you can\u2019t generalize. Several years ago I did this series of conversations by water, Skyping with people on the river in the Twin Cities on a boat and people in Louisiana down in New Orleans in a boat and we would just have a conversation. People in Louisiana were like \u201cOkay, what are you levees like? How does it work for you?\u201d And the others were like \u201cLevees? What do you mean?\u201d There was a lack of awareness of what some of the infrastructure was around the river. Because of course there are no levees in the Twin Cities in the way there are in Louisiana but there\u2019s a ton of infrastructure around the river. So again, I don\u2019t want to generalize but there\u2019s a really interesting lack of awareness. It\u2019s to do with the specifics of the place and why people are connected or disconnected; there\u2019s different reasons for that, which are interesting. That relates to what you saying, Monique, that all these places are vulnerable in some way or another, but getting into those specifics of vulnerability can tell us a lot.",

                "text": "Adam: I can\u2019t help to think, as we were talking about these distinctions between relationships with the river, that it is absolutely connected to the historic uses of the river and the evolution of use of the river and the divisions of the south and the north. I think about the river here in New Orleans, and the structuring of it coming out of the plantation economy and the levees here being constructed and built by enslaved black laborers. And how that has both been obscured but also laid the foundation for the current scale of industry that is situated along the river in the south. I think about the scale at which those industries and those enterprises both historically and contemporaneously affect the relationship that people in the south have with the river. I haven\u2019t spent much time along the river in Minneapolis or further north to have a sense of the infrastructural language that exists there, but I think there are these separations and divisions of historic use, which have obviously created contemporary\u2014and vulnerabilities. These levees aren\u2019t being maintained in the way they were created, and now we have these situations where there are so many unknowns about their structural integrity. Monique: I have to think about how the words, \u201centerprise\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure\u201d and how these intersect with \u201cimagination\u201d\u2014what humankind has made possible for commercial gain and how that ends up influencing culture in these unimaginable ways that makes this place [New Orleans] so rich. So rich and so exhausted and depleted and pillaged, in regard to just not respecting the natural intelligence of this place. I think that what our fellow journey folks really appreciated was the ability to travel through the space and I feel like we really were able to allow them to use all of their senses and to be reminded of the seen and the unseen. I don\u2019t know where we go from now. I\u2019m just feeling very exhausted and unsure what the best next steps are or what\u2019s worth investing time and energy and interest in. In us debrief what was really interesting was to see so many people wanting to have a site where folks could come to learn and be and share and experiment with something \u201cother,\u201d as a solution and a learning laboratory. That was really beautiful to see. Monica: This was in your debrief, Monique, afterwards? Monique: That was during an exercise when everybody had to draw their piece of the river. People got really into it; I was sad that we had to cut it short. But I felt that that was kind of beautiful.",

                "text": "Monica: That experience makes me bring it back to two of your questions. One is: in the face or the spirit of exhaustion, what would be the next best step and what would be worth spending time on? And also, back to the point integrity there\u2014I\u2019m kind of with the people who flipped off the big bus too\u2014what would we want to be different? Some of it is practical, for me, small groups for example. But is that just too simplified? What do you two think? Adam: Well, \u00a0the points Monique was bringing up points about the language around the enterprise and infrastructure\u2014 I\u2019m really curious about that. But in terms of an idea situation, back about when the Campus was taking place in November, the river was at a low point, it was at its respite. There is a dissonance between an experience of the river at its lowest point of intensity and the experience of the river when it\u2019s at flood stage. There\u2019s a kind of greater awareness of certain vulnerabilities that occur like right now, as we\u2019re recording [February 2019], when the river is extremely high, very early. Ideally, if we\u2019re talking about the Mississippi River as an Anthropocene River, there needs to a full experience and expression of that I think having multiple experiences with the river, understanding its fluctuations and how it impacts our day-to-day lives and how we live on and with the river, and how this affects us and our anxieties about it\u2014I feel like that could be the flipside of the coin that\u2019s missing. Monique: Humankind\u2019s imagination has created this infrastructure that has allowed us to believe in these artificial realities\u2014the norm of \u201cstaying dry.\u201d I think we\u2019re at a time where we\u2019re still wanting to hold onto that. Being at the bottom of the river, we know that so much that happens north of the mouth is affecting the health of the oceans. The concentration of the outfalls that happen here is contrasted with this being a place of entry, and all of the commerce that\u2019s flowing through, all the time, from all over the world. Historically you have these waves of immigration and also these waves of commodities\u2014whether it be bananas being brought up from Honduras, or medicine being developed through Tulane\u2014so they can keep the plantation workers alive. So there is that culture of commodification of whatever resources are being traded and in our modern times we have this petrochemical bonanza. We can talk about what that does for people and how they can be conditioned to think that plantation society is ok or having petrochemical industry across the street from my house is okay because, y\u2019know, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got a job. Then we can talk about how that plays out in the justification of our politics locally and also nationally as well, as well as what that means for international markets, with this trade happening on the banks. The exhaustion part comes from the fact that this little microcosm of the world that is the Mississippi Delta has so many global connections and reflections. Monica: It does. Which is why in the debrief the context is important because it does have so many connections and is a microcosm of so many things. That\u2019s why I feel like when we\u2019re asking people to orient towards their senses and to attune to both the seen and the unseen, when you do that, and focus on the details or what the seen and the unseen are in one location, such as in Congo Square, then that one site pulls forward the seen and the unseen and layers of the past and the present and towards the future. But it\u2019s also a microcosm and references so many other places and things globally. And maybe that\u2019s one of the reasons why, for me, at least, a site where people can be, and learn and share, and also come back becomes important. You need to ground this in something very specific, because that gives justice to an individual\u2019s experience and to very diverse levels of experience for different people. It gives justice to a place and in some ways it\u2019s the only way to get at that microcosm of a much bigger system. Otherwise it just stays an abstraction.",

Whatever that might really mean, with \u201cAnthropocene\u201d having a very broad definition of course, but it relates to just to being able to survive here when we\u2019re so dependent upon there being energy that\u2019s pumping water from the Mississippi River into like a series of tanks with a bunch of chemicals that are probably produced by a bunch petrochemical processes. Or energizing materials to be used so we can have clean water that can be pumped into our homes using energy. Or just pumping the water out of the city to keep us dry. These times that we live in and just how we\u2019ve become so accustomed to being dependent upon extraction and energy and different forms of these dark processes\u2014our comfort allows complicity. And so I think again about how we were cruisin\u2019 around in our big bus. Monica: The fact that the seminar was disrupted by the ferry not running, as Monique was saying, that all is the content of what we\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s really an important point. It\u2019s something I feel I\u2019ve been better at keeping \u00a0in mind in own work: that is the content\u2014anything that seems like a disruption is actually what you have to work with, in a way. Adam: Information. Monica: It\u2019s generative, it\u2019s information, it\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s never taking you away from the thing, it is the thing. But in terms of organizing something with big institutions, I think I still have to work at finding ways to make of room for when something like that happens\u2014because that is content to focus on just as much as anything. Adam: It really reminds me of what Monique said before, about believing in artificial realities, such as \u201cbeing dry\u201d, and how that breeds artificial securities. So how do we adapt and respond when the holes in that Potemkin fa\u00e7ade are broken,? Now just when we can see them but when we\u2019re experiencing them? Monica: Exactly, that\u2019s well put. Monique: I think the contradiction in these times of the so-called Anthropocene is that the solutions are often rooted in the problem. A classic example being that the restoration of the coast of South Louisiana, which is rapidly disappearing at one of the fastest rates on the planet, is essentially going to brought to us by all of these BP Deepwater disaster clean water act fines and so much of restoration will be dependent on royalties coming from Deepwater oil and gas heading into the future here. I think in our exhaustion we need to get out of that cycle of \u201coh, this thing that\u2019s killing us is maybe possibly going to help save us.\u201d When you feel like you have nothing else, I get that fear. Your fear can allow you to fall for ultimately false promises or short term solutions. Monica: So it\u2019s about how to generate and use both reality and imagination to generate something else. Well, the \u201csomething else\u201d that\u2019s already there perhaps, just not as dominant. Adam: Just thinking about solutions rooted in and emerging from the problems, that seems to be a dangerous and entropic cycle that will eventually come to an end. Monique: Hopefully! Adam: [laughs] No, I mean like one way or another, the end will come! That\u2019s like the definition of entropy\u2014repeating the same thing, compounding the nature of it, and then hoping for different results. That\u2019s just a downward spiral. I think about that in relation to dominant languages of where to place the blame about issues that we\u2019re confronting, such as the flooding that\u2019s happening right now, the flooding in Jackson, the flooding upriver, the record soil saturation rates\u2014and that\u2019s before the snow\u2019s even melted. This greater language of blame being placed on the environment or rainfall or whatever, and not this acknowledgment of\u2026 I mean this is all basic stuff but it\u2019s also not the dominant language that exists. Where is there room for that? Is there room for that to shift? How does a convening of a River Campus begin to distil pertinent language that can then have a larger, greater, more extensive impact? Monica: I\u2019m thinking that when we have this transcription, some of these questions might be really good starting points! For example, this question of how does convening in a Campus begin to have a language? One of the things that I really noticed or felt, both in terms of where we took people and what we asked them to do and attune to, and in the little pamphlet that we made, was the fact that, for me, a constant for was time. And this is a lot less rooted in certain practicalities maybe but time as in past, and present, and future. Just yesterday I was listening to this podcast by Ruby Sales, who is a public theologian and civil rights activist, and she talks about the ideas of hindsight, insight and foresight\u2014having all those visions is important. So in Congo Square, for example, we were asking people to be there right now, we were asking them to feel into that, to listen into that, to think about what came before and is still very present today \u2014the history of that place, the presence of that place. I think about when we were on the bus and driving down through St. Bernard Parish and Monique was pointing out so many things and talking about its present and its history. I think too about the skeletons of the live oak trees in the area, \u00a0one in particular that\u2019s nearly 600 years old, that\u2019s been around since the 1500s at least. And so many examples like that in the city. And then in the pamphlet, every page is thinking about time\u2014from the cover where we quoted Yaa Gyansi, who said what he wanted to capture with his project \u201cthe feeling of time, of having been part of something that stretched so far back, that was so impossibly large, that it was easy to forget that she, and he, and everyone else, existed in it \u2013 not apart from it, but inside it.\u201d I played this out in New Orleans and you can focus on so many specific places or specific histories and what they mean today, and it just highlights how, again, it\u2019s this microcosm of a lot of things in the country and a lot of things globally\u2014it calls out other systems. We\u2019d need more time to really get into that, but it\u2019s so productive to think about. Maybe \u201ctime\u201d isn\u2019t even the right singular word here, but it has a lot continuity among all the things we\u2019ve been talking about and asking people to do.",

I think about evaluating my own internal systems and the conditioning that I\u2019ve had and what I bring to this and how every time I interact with you two or a situation like this, I go away being critically aware of what I bring and my own conditioning. I go away aware of what I need to do to recondition myself in order to have a stronger understanding to approach things from a more informed and broader perspective beyond just my own internal system. So the importance of this kind of space is also about providing these individual checkpoints of self-criticality and forcing myself to be honest with myself about what it is that I bring and my own perspectives. Monique: Yeah, I feel like as we\u2019re\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that we\u2019re decolonizing ourselves or deprogramming ourselves or recognizing how we have our individual roles but there\u2019s also that comes from thinking about the Delta has being like this organism. When you look at this land from above, it\u2019s always super fascinating to me, just how it feels vascular\u2014there is this network, the imagination of nature to create this place. And then I think: what is our long-term collaboration with this place? Adam: That might be a really good question to leave with. Monique: Whatever this turns out to be I do like the idea that we have a series of questions and reflections. That we didn\u2019t have an answer or really a destination but that we brought people along on this journey in the hopes that it would continue to resonate\u2014I think that my hope was that we continued to create space to be honest with each other and analyze the data and recognize the life in it, those souls that are deeply connected to surviving the Anthropocene in challenged places\u2014which is everywhere.

The availability of social processes in the form of data sets then paves the way for the smooth and seamless control of societal activities.

From this vantage point, Bilgrami stresses the importance of thinking critically about the interdepencence between global capitalism, ecology and human societies, rather than merely analyzing the shifting relations between humans and nature in order to effectively re-politicize debates around the current environmental crisis. Drawing on wider intellectual history, Bilgrami first discusses the connection between the rationality of capitalism, political liberalism, and societal alienation and secondly argues for a complete terminus of capitalist systems.",

                "text": "For us, Romantic ideas on science and the world offer several conceptual tools with which to approach the problems of the technosphere. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Romantic thinkers began to criticize the scientific approach of the Enlightenment for its treatment of man and nature as mutable, reducible, and disenchanted entities\u2014masters and slaves. In contrast, Romantic attempts to rediscover society\u2019s lost unity with the natural world came to idealize the \u201cother\u201d as a source of understanding of our place in that world, rather than our mastery over it. Authors such as Adelbert von Chamisso combined mythical tales on the workings of nature with the travelogues of diligent Humboldtian naturalists, encouraging us to rediscover our wanderlust, and our ability to wonder and discover. On the other hand, the Romantic fascination with otherness, the sublime, or the uncanny also led to a renewed politics of marginalization and abuse. It was in this period that industrialization and colonization moved ahead, laying the foundations of the global technological society. To wander and wonder \u2026 To bridge the historical distance between nineteenth-century colonial Romanticism and twenty-first-century technospheric Romanticism, we take several intermediary intellectual stopovers. During the first stop, we provisionally take on the position of bourgeois fl\u00e2neurs, as they appear in Baudelaire\u2019s Paris; as \u201cpassionate spectator[s], [for whom] it is an immense joy [\u2026] to see the world, to be at the center of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world,\u201dCharles Baudelaire, The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays, tr. Jonathan Mayne. London: Phaidon Press, 1995, p. 9. and as they return in Walter Benjamin\u2019s meditations, as aloof yet keenly observant bourgeois dilettantes whose \u201cuncertain economic position correspond[s to] the uncertainty of their political function.\u201dWalter Benjamin, The Arcades Project, tr. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlan. Cambridge: Balknap Press, 1999, p. 10. As we produce this work, we remain mindful of our interpellation by social, political, and economic processes, and our implication in the contradictions inherent in the leisurely contemplation of urgent activity. The passive act of collecting intermittent fragments from the constant flow of commercial and human movement yields different results in Berlin\u2019s Westhafen-Moabit as compared with the arcades of nineteenth-century Paris, yet the problematics and systems of knowledge creation in the two instances beg comparison. Following Georg Simmel, Benjamin understands the uneasiness of the urban panorama of social life to stem from its \u201cmarked preponderance of visual activity over aural activity\u201dWalter Benjamin, \u201cThe Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire,\u201d in Selected Writings: Volume 4 1938\u20131940, ed. Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings. Cambridge: Belknap Press, 2003, pp. 19\u201320. Benjamin references the fourth edition of Georg Simmel\u2019s Soziologie, p. 486.\u2014that is, a lack of sonic communication that makes the visual representations of the city and its inhabitants more ominous because they are less knowable. By first disarticulating the aurality, visuality, and temporality of Westhafen-Moabit, and then re-collaging them together, we explore what can be regained through aesthetic experiences of the technosphere\u2019s local manifestation. Open, closed, sparse \u2026 A second halt brings us to the attempts of systems thinkers in the 1960s, aimed at dissolving the place opposite that of our environment altogether. At that time, systems ecologists and cyberneticists searched for alternatives to species-based and geographically limited classification schemes for vegetation.See, for example, Francis Raymond Fosberg, A Classification of Vegetation for General Purposes. Section IPB/CT (Conservation of Terrestrial Communities), International Biological Programme (IPB), 1967 Their attempts brought about a new focus on abstraction: on structure and basic functions independent of taxonomy and topography (and materiality) that we picked up on in our contribution. Their classifications did not depend on floristic criteria or particular plant species. Rather, they aimed at capturing the physiognomy, the vegetational arrangement in space: whether it was open, closed, or sparse. They purposefully avoided the incorporation of place-specific environmental information, such as climatic or geographic details, into their vegetation categories. In this way, they hoped to generate new fundamental knowledge without drawing premature conclusions about the functioning of systems or communities from isolated elements. We share in these attempts to rethink the regimentation of inherited epistemes, and to look again at the ontological division between nature and machinery. In this, our gaze is led by interesting spatial arrangements and structures, rather than by any a priori distinction between types of matter or substance. Juxtaposing the Romantic ambitions of unknowing the familiar and rediscovering the mundane with the cybernetic attempts to reconceptualize the distinction between nature and technology (or the lack thereof), our contribution to the \u201cRomancing the Anthropocene\u201d seminar combines video, sound, and image material that we collected during our field exercise in Berlin\u2019s Westhafen shipping district. In recording the industrially generated techno-biodiversity of the port district, we suggest new perspectives and ways of breaking up and opening rigid classification systems that capture and limit the knowledge of our environment in perhaps obsolete ways. As we consider the problematics of our subject positions, our creative repurposing of the sensory experience in an industrial transportation hub during springtime is an attempt at subversion. We attempt to inflect our wandering contemplation, collection, and reconfiguration of aesthetic practices that go some way towards recuperating a Romantic taxonomical project.",

        "abstract": "How to avoid leaving out certain aspects of a wicked problem? Systems thinking strives for comprehensive problem analysis with an attempt to circumvent erroneously focusing on only one aspect of the problem.

                "text": "An example of a nonlinear phenomenon due to positive feedback is the loss of Arctic sea ice due to global warming. This ice loss creates changes in surface albedo (replacing white, radiation-reflecting ice with dark, radiation-absorbing open water), which in turn dramatically increases the pace of further ice loss. An example of a nonintuitive phenomenon is how the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, administered to livestock, is increasing cases of leptospirosis and rabies in human beings in South Asia. The mechanism for this increase is that the drug is toxic to Indian Gyps vultures, whose population has collapsed, leaving cattle carcasses unconsumed. Instead, the carcasses are eaten by rats and feral dogs, which carry leptospirosis and rabies, causing a population boom in those species, which in turn are infecting the human population. A principal tool in analyzing systems is \u201cmodeling.\u201d Many models are mathematical, but they need not be; role-playing games, for example, have often been used to help students, politicians, and organizations understand how multiple goals and constraints interact such that well-intentioned decisions sometimes produce nonintuitive, undesirable outcomes. A model is simply a theoretical construct or abstraction that represents a defined system. The \u201cart\u201d of modeling is forming a useful abstraction, which is complex enough to include major features of the system while being simple enough to allow for characterization. The simpler the model, the greater the level of understanding of model components and outcomes. However, simplicity needs to be balanced by the need to include key components of the system to allow for a reasonable representation of the system. Stephan Hartmann summarized five functions of model simulations where the definition of a simulation or model is an imitation of one process by another.Stephan Hartmann, \u201cThe world as a process: simulations in the natural and social sciences,\u201d in: Rainer Hegselmann et al. (eds), Simulation and Modelling in the Social Sciences from the Philosophy of Science Point of View. Theory and Decision Library. Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1996, pp. 77\u2013100. Hartmann\u2019s list of overlapping uses of a model include: as a technique to investigate detailed dynamics of a system; as a heuristic tool to develop hypotheses, models, and theories; as a substitute for performing experiments; as a support to experimentalists; and as a pedagogic tool that can be used to gain understanding of a process (or processes) or system.    As noted above, models allow us to test hypotheses, to improve our understanding of a system, and to predict the future behavior of a system. In developing a model, you must first choose the type of model to develop (see below) and then make a series of decisions that forces you to understand the system. You must decide on what is inside and outside the boundary (as a side note, nearly all models of natural phenomena are \u201copen,\u201d with transfers from outside to inside the model boundary). The boundary is arbitrary but critical since it circumscribes what you are considering. Next, you must decide on the processes included within the system boundary. Finally, depending on the nature of the model, you must decide on how best to characterize the processes considered. Models are part of our lives. We construct \u201cmental models\u201d as abstractions of our complex reality, in order to navigate through that complexity. Our mental models incorporate, for example, our moral precepts, our political outlook, and our comfort with risk. We use our implicit mental models in decision-making when confronted with old and new problems. Many types of models exist, as briefly enumerated below: Conceptual models: The simplest conceptual model is \u201cA causes B.\u201d A conceptual model summarizes the components of a system and their interconnections or \u201ccausal relationships.\u201d It may also include some expression of the relative strength of those connections. Examples of conceptual models include those developed by Thomas Homer-Dixon to describe the players and their interactions in areas of conflict.Edward Barbier and Thomas Homer-Dixon, \u201cResource Scarcity, Institutional Adaptation, and Technical Innovation: Can Poor Countries Attain Endogenous Growth?\u201d Occasional Paper, Project on Environment, Population and Security. Washington, DC: American Association for the Advancement of Science and the University of Toronto, 1996, online (accessed 24/02/2016). Physical models: These models are simplified reconstructions of a system that can be used to explore the behavior of that system. These models are used in cases where it is difficult to observe and measure a system, particularly as the system responds to perturbations. The modeled system may have instruments installed to allow measurements to be taken as the system is perturbed or changed. A hydraulic flume and a wind tunnel are examples of physical models that recreate a streambed and an atmospheric system, respectively. Analog models: Analog models are abstractions of a system \u201cby analogy.\u201d They are useful for representing a complex system by a simpler analogy. The Phillips Hydraulic Computer or Monetary National Income Analogue Computer (MONIAC) is a physical model that uses the flow of water as an analogy to model the national economic process of the United Kingdom. Statistical models: These models use statistical expressions to relate an independent variable (predictor, explanatory, or controlled variable) and a dependent or response variable. These models can be expressions of a \u201ccause\u2012effect\u201d relationship as with regression models. However, they can also represent non-causative correlations. Statistical models can also include statistical functions or distributions. An example of a statistical function is Schelling\u2019s model, which is used to explain behavior in a social system. Econometric models constitute a large category of statistical models. Econometric models are based on statistical descriptions of economic data placed within a theoretical framework. Mechanistic models: These models use mathematical expressions to depict causal relationships. The models can be relatively simple extractions of a system such as an input\u2012output model or can be made more sophisticated by including numerous subsystems within the larger system (see the World3 model). An example of a simple mechanistic model is a mathematical expression to quantify the one-dimensional movement of heat between air and water. This simple expression is one key element within a highly complex Global Circulation Model, or GCM, used to estimate global climate systems. The GCM contains numerous submodels, of which the movement of heat between air and water is but one. Each submodel must be carefully constructed and parameterized, and then the submodels are linked. Mechanistic models can consider a system at steady state (no change with time) or dynamic conditions where the system changes over time, such as GCMs. In addition to considering the time dimension, mechanistic models can explain conditions in one, two, or three spatial dimensions and, as such, consider geographic variability. The model categories are nonexclusive. For example, it is common for a mechanistic model to contain statistical expressions. Models are used extensively in just about every facet of life. Models, such as econometric models, are used for decision-making by exploring existing and future projections of economic conditions such as growth of GDP. Transportation models are used to plan urban growth or health effects from vehicle emissions. Models of chemical behavior are used to explore the efficacy of new pharmaceutical compounds or chemical contaminants and to understand the behavior of such compounds in the human body. Environmental models, including GCMs, are used to set fishery and forestry quotas, and ecosystem responses to perturbations, to mention just a few examples. Crawford S. Holling introduced adaptive resource-management models to allow for rational decision-making for systems with competing priorities and numerous uncertainties or uncontrollable factors. Indeed, the ability of a model to investigate the consequences of uncertainty and system variability is a major attraction for their use.",

Parallel lines of steel, spaced exactly 1.435 meters apart, still dissect the land\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. The railroad was a technology for standardizing time and space in order to commodify nature. The trains ran on time in order to move troops and materiel and, later, Jews according to the plan. When the plan went off its tracks and the yard fell into neglect, rain opened scars in the hard-packed dirt and wooden sleepers. Instead of following tables, time now unfolded in the slow melting of concrete, the development of plants, and the succession of species. And yet, the infrastructure of capital continued to pattern the landscape\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 With spring showers, emerald moss colonized steel rails, running in uncanny straight lines as if it had somewhere to go. The first pioneer birch trees flowered, and their seeds fluttered down and took root in the cracks rain opened in railroad ties. As yard became Natur-Park, the two-dimensional grid grew into three- dimensions\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Organic nature grafted onto the machine. From high above, this hybrid forest\u2019s pattern recalls the cellular structure of the trees themselves. Cellulose, as rigid as steel, runs in parallel lines\u2014But wait! How easily we have tripped on the tracks and slipped past abstraction into organicist mysticism. What analytical purchase would this visual analogy provide? What critical purpose does noting the homology serve? It satisfied our interdisciplinary ambitions to recognize patterns across scales, but we\u2019re witnessing similar events. No: the technosphere is not reduced to the biosphere. We set out to show how capitalist projects literally structured landscapes long after their obsolescence. We almost ended up in ahistorical, functionalist time, which makes assigning collective responsibility seem petty\u2014and thus imagining alternative responsible collectives impossible. (And yet, says our complex systems botanist, there is that functional pattern&#8230;)background sound ticking clock/rain drops/mouse clicks/ \u2026 is popping seeds from the very pine trees that Frederick II imported to the park",

In the weeks leading up to the field campus, participants became more familiar with the work of their peers through online meetings. For one of our sessions, we encouraged participants to watch the documentary\u00a0The Safe Side of The Fence\u00a0and to conduct an\u00a0online group interview\u00a0with the film\u2019s director, Tony West.",

Visiting these sites, we saw how a range of public and private actors manage them, how locals interact with them, and how they function as civic infrastructures that shape public discourse around issues such as radioactive exposure and environmental health. On the first day of the field campus, we visited the St. Louis Airport Project Site (SLAPS). Here, we met with project managers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who currently are removing residual waste from the Mallinckrodt Chemical Company\u2019s uranium refining over the course of the 1940s and 1950s in St. Louis. Our discussion at SLAPS was centered on the goals and the frustrations of the remediation process \u2013 a process which, already over-schedule, will likely continue for several more years. We also visited the Weldon Spring Containment Cell at St. Charles, Missouri. At the height of the nuclear arms race during the Cold War in the 1950s, Mallinckrodt Chemical Company relocated uranium production from downtown St. Louis to a new refinery in St. Charles. Following the plant\u2019s closure, a conversion turned the site into a 42-acre containment cell designed to contain 1.5 million cubic yards of radioactive material for 1,000 years. At the Weldon Springs Interpretive Center, museum guides taught us about their methods for informing the public about the legacy of the uranium industry and nuclear waste in the St. Louis region.",

In a discussion moderated by Tony West, director of The Safe Side of the Fence, we met with Brian Zink, an attorney at Atomic Weapons Employee Consultants; Wendy Verhoff, a historian of radioactive waste in St. Louis; and Denise Brock, Ombudsman to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The discussion centered on the legacy of uranium refining in the city, and the more than 500,000 nuclear workers who have since developed exposure-related illnesses. Much of the talk focused on Denise Brock\u2019s key role in implementation of the procedures of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA). This legislation ensures that both compensation and payment of medical expenses are available to the workers and their families who have developed illnesses due to exposure to radioactive substances at certain nuclear facilities. This was an opportunity not just to hear from St. Louis locals, but also to think about how issues such as radioactive exposure tie together different sites and actors across the globe. During the discussion, participant Guilberly Louissaint asked a provocative question about whether we can speak of a global nuclear victimhood, which includes workers in St. Louis, indigenous Canadian and Congolese uranium miners, as well as victims of the atomic bombings of Japan.",

                "text": "Experimenting with Different Modes of Expression and Representation: Community Archiving Project A key aim of the St. Louis Field Campus was to experiment with different modes of scholarly and artistic expression, and to develop a set of tactics that participants could take back into their own field sites. For this, on the one hand, we invited Yanni Loukissas and Emily Catedral of the\u00a0St. Louis Map Room, who engaged us in a community-mapping project. On the other, the artists involved in the campus brought with them their rich experience with materials and forms, of which we had learned previously in both the technical applications and in the online meetings that took place before the campus. In addition to mapping, we decided to focus on different forms of communicative expression: photography, film, podcast, drawing, and walking tours. Participants had a chance to sign up for groups according to their own interests. However, we also envisioned the field campus as a tactic in and of itself, as a way to engage participants in new forms of documentation or\u00a0rogue archiving\u201c,\u201d a method attuned to the demands of anthropocenics. We visited two local history museums, the\u00a0Wood River Refinery History Museum, located on the grounds of the refinery itself, and the Wood River Museumlocated in Wood River, Illinois. In the Refinery Museum, we interviewed the curators, who themselves had worked at the plant, and we discussed the challenges of safeguarding the history (with all of its complexities) to ensure it remained alive and vital. We also visited the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site, near the convergence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Here we encountered a much more formal public museum, but also one that struggles to place the history of American exploration within the broader context of struggles over resources, racial and Indigenous violence, and the meta-narratives of the American Empire. Our discussions, here, with the staff and guides were lively, and opened up new ways of considering the possibilities for localized Anthropocene archives. Though we welcomed making use of the Disaster-STS Network platform\u2019s capacity for collaboration, we also wanted to allow for the local means of documentation and presentation. For this, we prepared a final exhibition at Granite City Art and Design District (G-CADD), where we installed each group\u2019s project. These included a film and photo essay, which we projected on to the wall; a range of short podcasts; imaginary \u201cAnthropocene Tours\u201d; and a large-scale map that documented the St. Louis Anthropocene Field Campus. We also provided a large-format poster for each of the twelve questions we were asking, so that participants were able to contribute their insights in a semi-structured way. The research findings and artistic contributions were deliberately provisional, but they serve as a model for future field campuses as a way to connect analogue practices with the digital archive. Finally, this engagement will continue through a series of online meetings, called the Open Seminar. In\u00a0bi-monthly meetings, we will discuss and prepare for the next campus, the New Orleans Anthropocene Field Campus, which will take place immediately before the annual meeting of the\u00a0Society for Social Studies of Science (4S). The seminars are open to anybody who is interested in attending.",

                "text": "As it was too difficult to discern in the transcript all the different voices, each speaker below is marked with an X. This also reflects the collective nature of the discussion, and the ways in which ideas built upon each other. X: I have a background in physics and in geology and so I\u2019m always looking for a few physical relationships that transcend or that remain true, despite a lot of the complications that we see in everyday life, as basically that\u2019s how science has been able to organize its view of the world. So I was thinking to myself, well, as the Anthropocene seemed to be pressing in from all sides\u2014I was reading about it in the newspaper, in the magazines and on the web, in emails\u2014I began to think about what the Anthropocene might be and how, given my own background, to think about its dynamics. The Earth is four and a half billion years old and the Anthropocene \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of fairly vigorous argument about when it began, in terms of scientific definition, but, in terms of the history of the Earth, it began very very very very recently. One thing that is clear is the Earth is continuously doing amazing new radical things such as the appearance of life, or the appearance of the hydrologic cycle, or the circulation of the atmosphere, the patterns of the mountains, the patterns of the ripples on the sand dunes, the beautiful meanders of the streams. One thing you see is that before having to invoke the complexity and understanding and wisdom and so on of humans, the Earth has already gone a very long way to producing a lot of wonderful, beautiful, intricate, complex stuff that even today, with all of the things we do know, we\u2019re still working hard to unravel and clarify what those systems are and how they work, including the relationships between them. Any system in the world that does something uses energy, and that\u2019s kind of just a basic physical requirement. In other words, it has a metabolism, so the technosphere is a metabolic system that\u2019s sitting out there. One could argue that there are several relations that probably pertain to the technosphere. One is that it uses energy. The second is that it generates waste. If you have a system that consumes energy, that persists through many internal actions, many internal motions, many internal time cycles, then that system basically knows how to survive. Thirdly, a system has to provide an environment in which its parts are able to carry out whatever operations they\u2019re doing in support of its existence. So if you have a piston inside an engine of a car, that piston works to make the car functional, and, if it didn\u2019t do that, it would either be ejected from the car or the car wouldn\u2019t work, and the car provides a nice environment for the piston to move up and down in this smooth, well-lubricated cylinder. So, basically, I look at the technosphere as such a system, although we don\u2019t understand the details of it. But really, the reason we\u2019re here is there\u2019s a large gun pointed at all of us and the gun is loaded and we have our finger on the trigger and our hand seems to be contracting on it\u2014we can\u2019t seem to let it go. This is what we have to understand, that the technosphere has a scientific component, an aesthetic component, a social component, a knowledge component, and we really need to figure out how to get that finger off the trigger. X: I\u2019m a chemist and, if I summarize what you said from a chemist\u2019s view, on this planet you are bound to energetic and material transformations. They play an extremely important role without our doing: that\u2019s the biosphere. We humans introduced new processes, used up new resources\u2014which are not mobile, not active, not functionalized in the biosphere. As chemists, our goal is to follow the history of materials. We follow the story of stuff in time and space. You can imagine that this is an interdisciplinary task. If you follow the line of the car then there is plastic, and the source of plastic is fossil fuel, and fossil fuel comes from photosynthesis. So we have here a kind of concentrated time, but there is more. There is not only plastics, there are metals. One of the characteristics of the Anthropocene is the introduction of many metals. The technosphere depends on the use of metal and the functions of metals. Imagine being a metal and seeing what humans are doing to metals; because these metals were not in the biosphere before we mobilized them, we don\u2019t know the interactions between new metals being mobilized and their potential function in biology. So, the interrelation between technosphere and biosphere is a special one. It is a cultural one, a social, cultural one; it\u2019s also technical. We all drive the biosphere to some extent. X: From the point of view of biologists, we are interested in understanding the dynamics of those historical processes. These historical processes have been captured by evolution, and evolutionary theory, as you know, has a rather recent history. In the sciences, this history is roughly 200 years old, but it has already undergone some substantial transformations. A lot of that transformation has to do with connecting simple, more linear understandings of historical change with the complexities that we have been exposed to in the technosphere and material resources. The question arises: where does biological evolution stop and where does cultural and technological evolution begin? Or is this even a meaningful question? What does it take to isolate any particular system and by what criteria are we doing that? Take the example of metals. Obviously, they are now part of the system. But we have no idea how these will affect the evolutionary dynamics of even the remotest populations of species on the planet. Another example is the large amount of synthetic chemicals that we have introduced into the biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere, and we really only have, at best, anecdotal evidence of what that does. We know that genomes\u2014the historical record of biological species\u2014are not isolated and only change through the internal dynamics of mutations. But rather, there are many direct ways that genomes can be changed through complex interactions and one of them has to do with all the materials\u2014metals, chemicals\u2014that we have now released on a large scale as part of the technosphere. Trying to understand those dynamics will become incredibly important, not only for academic or scientific purposes, but also because we are facing a big gun. As well, there are other concerns between our understanding of how complex systems change through time, co-evolutionary dynamics, and how we try to assert control in the context of the Anthropocene. The technosphere is not designed, yet we are living in a delusion that we can design the future to some degree. Whether it\u2019s from the point of view of a technologist, futurist, economist, astrologist (which is more or less the same thing as an economist), there\u2019s a general emphasis on the need for innovation, the \u201cright kind\u201d of innovation. Nobody seems to realize that we are only in the dilemma that we are facing because of centuries of unchecked innovation. And if you think about what innovations do to those highly interconnected systems, what innovations do is they generate unintended consequences. If you introduce new innovations into these systems, do the unintended consequences scale at a rate of smaller than one or larger than one? If they scale at a rate of larger than one, then we have a problem because each innovation is basically an avalanche of exponential growth of unintended consequences. X: We can see the growth of the technosphere, but the question is, how shall we grasp its dynamics? I think this is one of the major questions that we were asked, how can we grasp its dynamics, independently of intentions on the part of its actors? X: You mentioned that there have been efforts to extend evolutionary theory into cultural evolution, or to think about culture as a part of evolution, and I\u2019m just curious, what type of evolutionary theory are people engaging with? Is it a Darwinian evolutionary theory, and, if so, is it natural selection or sexual selection? And then, how do things like epigenetics and viruses and all these other kinds of evolutionary phenomena enter into that? Can we also think of machines or the technosphere as having their own evolutionary logic? X: It\u2019s an excellent question and in a way what it also shows is that it\u2019s a question that hits right on where science is changing as we speak. So the first models of cultural evolution were mainly Darwinian and tried to basically operate or find an equivalent of a hereditary entity in cultural or technological dimensions. That turns out to be not very useful, and as a consequence of our discussions in cultural evolution we are beginning to see the limitations of a strictly Darwinian approach to biological evolution, which leads to epigenetics. The avant-garde of evolutionary biology is right now. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to conceptualize evolution as a transformation of complex networks, rather than as simply the calculus of variation in a population. Then the evolutionary problem becomes more interesting, it becomes more historical or it becomes more connected. Within such a framework you can then really speak in a meaningful way about evolutionary dynamics in the technosphere. Traditional Darwinian models do not worry about the origin of variation. They take that for granted and you just look out the window and say why variation is everywhere. You look at the structure of hereditary material like DNA and we can calculate the average rate of mutation, so what\u2019s the problem? But, as we see in complex systems, whether they\u2019re cultural or technological or biological, the origin of variation is actually the more interesting problem. What happens to variation is not trivial but we understand it much better than we understand where something new actually comes from. This allows for broader perspectives and where we can learn a lot\u2014not just from molecular biology, but from the arts, because you have the same problem. How do you generate something new? It becomes a generative problem rather than a selective problem. X: I would just like to bring Jeremy Rifkin to the table. He is talking about how, because of lateral communications, we\u2019re going to share cars and not buy our own cars, and then car production will be greatly reduced. Even if we can criticize some of his ideas, if we were to avoid or remove all the obsolete technology, what would be the future within the technosphere? X: As I see the evolution of technology, it goes in layers. It is true that in autogenesis we capitulate phylogenetics, and I think in technological development that\u2019s also true. I mean, we have a lot of digital technology but without the underpinning, the scaffolding of much more primitive technologies, I\u2019m not sure how many of these upper technologies would survive. If my iPhone doesn\u2019t work to take notes, I use a pen, and if that doesn\u2019t work I go to something even more primitive. This kind of scaffolding is very much a part of the construction of the technosphere, so obsoleteness also has to be judged not only in terms of what is the most progressive technology out there, but on what sustains the dynamics of the technosphere. X: I think you\u2019ve chosen a really great illustration with your pen versus your computer. I think it\u2019s true that the technology is essentially a solid phase phenomenon. That is, I don\u2019t think you can make technology out of fluids alone. Fluids, or at least common fluids like water and air, generally have very little memory, so if you have a boat that went across a lake at high speed, then you have this nice churned-up wake behind the boat and so the lake remembers, after the boat has passed\u2014it remembers that something has happened. But ten minutes later, there\u2019s not much evidence and an hour later you can\u2019t tell that that boat went through unless, maybe, you made some incredibly sensitive measurements. But if you take a field and you drag a plow across the field, the plow leaves a wake behind it. If you wait ten minutes, it\u2019s still there. You wait an hour, it\u2019s still there, and you wait a year, perhaps, or maybe many years and it\u2019s still there. I think underlying technology and the technosphere and basically all of civilization are these layers of infrastructure that\u2019s built mostly of solids and needs energy to run. It\u2019s hard to make the vast amount of memory that\u2019s inherent in technology and the technosphere obsolete. It\u2019s also hard to put in infrastructure; it\u2019s very expensive, in part because you\u2019re moving solid stuff around. So the internet and electronic communications have very little friction in a sense; it\u2019s easy to move quanta of electromagnetic radiation or little bits of information along a fiber optic, but putting in that fiber optic is harder because it\u2019s solid. I think this puts a certain amount of inertia into the Anthropocene. X: We have processes that run simultaneously on extremely different timescales. If you think about our skeleton, it changes every ten years, although it seems to be solid. If you say that these are solid structures, you might be right, but our time window is very limited. If the time window is one million years, it\u2019s not solid anymore. But natural science says that because you don\u2019t have a timescale or a living timescale that it is solid. But, as a chemist, this is what I\u2019ve learned: solids are not solid. It just depends on the time frame we choose. And the art of the game in the technosphere is that you have to compose processes that are extremely different. X: One thing that I haven\u2019t really heard anyone talk about yet is the role of human agency in these co-evolutionary processes or the technosphere. We heard about how the technosphere is not designed but there are elements of human agency, and when we talk about it as an evolutionary process, I think we get this sense that it\u2019s inevitable that it evolved naturally. When we start to think about this in a historical framework, we have to think about the levels at which decisions were made and the processes that put these things in motion. X: Sometimes one gets the impression that the technosphere has taken on a high degree of autonomy. We shouldn\u2019t restrict ourselves, I believe, to the actors on the one hand and the material world on the other. There\u2019s an institutional world, there\u2019s an economic world, and much of the technosphere is the product of economic processes of industrialization, of capitalism, so where does this dimension come in? X: I think these are key questions. The reason why I refer to the technosphere as autonomous is obviously not that humans cannot affect it or influence it\u2014they certainly do. If humans went away, then all technology, the technosphere, would go away, but, of course, the converse is also true. If technology went away, basically 99.9 percent of the people would go away as well. If you looked at the ocean and you looked at the waves on the ocean, then the waves are made of what? They\u2019re made of water molecules. A little molecule sits in there: what does it do if you zoom in? It is going back and forth, it\u2019s vibrating around and it\u2019s talking to its neighbors and it has this little individual life. But on top of the ocean, if we look at a molecule near the surface, the surface of the ocean is going like this, in a wave, and so what is the relationship with the individual life of the molecule? And yet somehow it\u2019s responsible for this large gigantic motion that is on a scale vastly larger than the individual molecule. I think humans are kind of like this. It is possible for large numbers of people to be involved in something that has a continuous lasting dynamic, or lasting effects, without people really being aware that that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. But humans aren\u2019t molecules; they\u2019re intentional. The reason I think the technosphere is autonomous is because it keeps on running. You know, the indium is coming out of the mines and the oil is coming out of the oilfields and the coal is coming out of some other mines. It\u2019s the sum of what all the molecules are doing, but you get a distorted picture of how that system works. We call it the Anthroposphere because humans are very important. What are the dynamics of that wave? How does that work? It has to include human intention, but you can\u2019t have something that\u2019s running continuously for a long period of time, and all connected together, that doesn\u2019t have its own rules of operation, since there\u2019s no person running it. I don\u2019t think this position is technological determinism; I think it\u2019s technological rigidity or systemic inertia. The key point is here: if people are parts, people are programmable parts. We don\u2019t always have to operate in the same way\u2014there is such a thing as education and changing people\u2019s viewpoints. In all the big environmental movements, that is what they\u2019re trying to do, they\u2019re trying to collectively change the minds of a large number of people. If everybody in the world were concerned about climate change, which is probably the key problem of the Anthropocene, then I presume that would be reflected in how the technosphere worked. X: From the point of view of natural science, agency and intention become a quantitative problem. If the ratio of intention to unintended consequences is of a certain value, does it matter whether we have intentions? X: The technosphere is evolving in a direction of increasing complexity and this is the direction that we\u2019ll call evolution. So, I wonder how we can relate this biosphere and technosphere? X: I would like to see discussed what I may call the internal dynamics of the technosphere in the sense that so far we are looking at these as very global and abstract concepts, and we are not filling in context dependency. The other thing is, again, the relation with the economic and political systems. I don\u2019t see the technosphere as autonomous in the sense that there is a tight relation to economic and political decisions. X: I think part of doing that work, the contextual work, is this question that emerged in the twentieth century around whether or not human beings could cause extinction. That conversation emerges \u2026 it has an older history around millennial thought and apocalyptic thought, but it particularly emerges around nuclear weapons. And the way that gets worked out is at an institutional, collective level where people said: \u201cWell, what will keep us from doing that?\u201d People with consciousness can decide to drop an atomic bomb on a city, so it has to be one level up. It has to be either physicists working across borders, or it has to be the state, or an international body. Charles Perrow, a sociologist, has done some recent writing about post-Fukushima and he asked this question: \u201cIs there any evidence we could be shown that would cause us to shut down the system?\u201d So it\u2019s just the opposite; it\u2019s the lack of faith in the consciousness. He\u2019s saying that it doesn\u2019t seem to matter how much information you take in, or how bad the disasters are, we can\u2019t seem to conceptualize shutting down the system. This is not technological determinism per se; is there failure in our thinking? Is there a failure in our consciousness, or a failure in our institutions? Coming back to this question that was asked before about innovation, historians of technology spend a lot of time thinking about the history of invention and innovation. We don\u2019t tend to think of it as something that is hardwired or has evolved over time. In what I study in disaster investigations, for example, the information from the disaster investigation is never complete before the system is being rebuilt. They were rebuilding, preparing to re-start the nuclear power grid in Japan long before having a final sense of what exactly failed in that system. Does that speak to a failure of our institutions? Maybe it also speaks to some sort of evolutionary process in our brains as well, that we\u2019re risk-taking minded rather than restraint minded. So I don\u2019t know where that leads us, but I think maybe it\u2019s a way that sort of brings biological concepts around evolution and extinction into this realm of deeper digging, at a granular level, into the way institutions work and our consciousness of what institutions can do. X: I come back often to a specific remark: none of these systems are really isolated, yet they create local conditions and that\u2019s the difficult balance and equilibrium that we have to keep. X: I would say that the point of the technosphere argument is to start abstracting out all the properties of humans and any pieces of technology and technological systems from any explicit role that defines what the technosphere is and how it works. In other words, it has no context by design, except for what is necessary to describe a bare-bones energy-consuming system with the purpose that, if that description is independent of whatever the context would be, is something that you should keep in the back of your mind when looking at specific contextual issues. I think that the technosphere leaves those things out on purpose. I see the technosphere concept as complementary to a full understanding of how the system actually works. Now, I know there are some philosophers here. I\u2019m not a philosopher, but in the course of thinking about intentionality and agency and so on, I was reading a little bit of the philosophy I should have read as a schoolboy, and Kant has made this distinction between what he called regulative and constitutive rules. Regulative rules or principles would be those you use to frame a problem, to describe the essence of it. Constitutive rules would be where you try to constitute the meaning with, or realize, or give the system a constitution: in other words, to give it a context. I think one of the huge jobs of the Anthropocene is to try to constitute all the things we know about human behavior, history, art, and so on into a unified framework for understanding this global, integrated problem. I agree that there\u2019s a lot of context missing\u2014basically, it\u2019s all missing from the technosphere\u2014but that\u2019s by design and I\u2019m greatly in favor of putting a lot more back in. X: Language shapes who we are, it constructs us, and allows us to have intersubjective relationships to one another, and at the same time we use it to express our intentions and to make them manifest. But, we don\u2019t get to choose what words mean and we\u2019re bound up in a system that is much larger than we are, that functions based on sets of rules and regularities that are not within our control. We don\u2019t get to decide how the grammar of our languages work. We may speak in a gibberish code that we made up ourselves, but unless we\u2019ve specified the rules of that code to somebody else, nobody\u2019s going to understand us. So we\u2019re actually bound into systems of rules and regularities that are themselves causally bound up in how we use those systems, because language, as we know, is not a static system, it is evolving and changing. One of the interesting things about languages is that we\u2019re constantly saying sentences that have never been said before. Talk about innovation, right? But we\u2019re innovating with parts that are really preexisting and that are governed by some very solid rules. X: Let me briefly react to this example. Language history is a prime example of cultural evolution and to some extent language can be considered as a symbolic technology, so it fits very nicely with this talk of the technosphere. There are clearly hereditary elements to it; there is a continuity because there is a pool from which we draw when we form an individual sentence. Yet, as you said, every sentence is an innovation, a small-scale innovation, but there is also the example of when language is not just in flux, changing gradually, but when entire language systems change. Those systemic changes, they happen. Languages emerge and they disappear as systems so there is something, not just on the level of individual causality, but on the level of systemic causality. X: I think that what\u2019s exciting for me about the concept of the technosphere and the effort to couple it, so to speak, with this idea of co-evolution is precisely the possibility of getting beyond this tension between individual agency versus structural process. To think about the material conditions and possibility for agency that is not just constrained by these broader processes but actually enabled by them. What are the material conditions and possibility for action within these systems and how can we develop an analysis that would enable us to more effectively pursue things that we might want to pursue? X: The idea that technology might be driving us, rather than the other way round, and that it constrains us, reminds me of toxoplasmosis\u2014a parasite that affects rats in that it makes them attracted to cats, which then eat them and the parasite gets to the cat\u2019s brain. The cats also live in human houses and the parasite also makes it to human brains and there it also increases risk-taking behavior. It might even influence the technosphere if you think about the number of cat pictures on the internet. So, that might tie the biosphere and technosphere together. X: Somewhere in my reading, I came across this idea that the human species is very unstable from an evolutionary point of view. What implications does this have for our conversation and the Anthropocene? X: It\u2019s sheer luck that we\u2019re still here, but not because of what we did, but because of some climatic events about several thousand years ago when our species was almost wiped out. We are no more unstable than most other species. Actually, there is something unique about the human species that few others have and it is basically that we have colonized a whole planet. We are a very generalist species and we could do that largely because of early instances of what we now call the technosphere; the way we got around required certain technology, such as boats. We have been talking in a very presentist way so far. One of the concepts that I want to introduce is also something that our brains seem to be not very good at, and that is understanding action at a distance, and also action at a historical distance. X: I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re understanding human consciousness as a technology here. I mean, you spoke about symbolic language, but if we also think about the geomind from Wolfgang Lutz, and his excellent paper called \u201cThe Mental Component of the Earth System,\u201d what we\u2019re doing here is terraforming our noosphere. The infrastructure of our communication is what is inhibiting the further development, and coupling, of elements in this complex nervous system. For example, in Julian Jaynes\u2019 seminar \u201cThe Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind,\u201d he\u2019s trying to understand, essentially, consciousness as a technology, and he sees that we don\u2019t really have this capacity to communicate or think without a tripartite time consciousness\u2014past, present, future. He thinks that that capacity to predict is also the origin of language. A long time ago, when we wanted to kill something to eat it, we had to understand this trajectory, where it was going to be, to be able to throw something. That embodied movement allowed us to develop language. X: I just wanted to add a sort of case study in terms of the relationship between Australia and the Pacific, mediated by phosphorus. Australia has some of the oldest soil, or certainly the most denuded soil, of any inhabited continent. The entire foundation of agriculture in Australia would not be possible without phosphorus, which was mined by plundering the top few meters of the neighboring islands in the Pacific. So Australia not only took the islands from the top down, but they\u2019ve now taken the islands from the bottom up through anthropogenic climate change. Phosphorous is an interesting way to look at this top-down/bottom-up relationship between Australia and its Pacific island neighbors. X: Going back to the question of agency, but following up on the wonderful narrative of phosphorus, there\u2019s a growing literature that is taking the concept of agency out of the human sphere and using it to think about the natural world and its functioning\u2014like the argument that maize or corn has domesticated us. And there are huge repercussions to this that we don\u2019t even really understand. Would someone comment more on what the implications are of using the concept of agency in this way? What\u2019s gained and lost by it? X: We have to look at all those processes as co-evolutionary processes. Just a show of hands: how many in this room are lactose-intolerant? A few. Why only so few? It\u2019s a genetic change that happened in human populations over the last roughly 7,000 years, after the domestication of enough animals that milk actually became a reliable food source. Our genomes adapted. They also adapted to the digestion of alcohol, another interesting by-product, and we have plenty of genetic variation in the human population along those lines, and the story continues. So in that sense, there is no such thing as a unique, individualized, evolutionary trajectory. It\u2019s always a co-evolutionary event. We now have good studies about what it takes for people to happily live on the Tibetan plateau, in low-oxygen environments. That is an event that happened over roughly 600 years, which is basically instantaneous in evolutionary time, with very complex physiological adaptations. So, we are changing ourselves, in the same way as we are changing our environment. Let me expand a little bit on that. I think, when we look at the beginnings of humanity as Homo sapiens in our present shape, roughly about 100,000 years ago, that development has itself a long history, and it is already a co-evolutionary history. This particular brand of the species Homo has evolved under technological conditions. We find technological remnants with many of our ancestors and parallel species, so clearly the process of adaptation has already been a mutual one. We have used technology, even in our biological origins. X: What do we need to understand to understand our current state in order to extrapolate the future? One of the elements that was brought up several times was, of course, our own mind, or our cognitive abilities, and where they come from. And, of course, there is a very rational way to look at those, through the lenses of an evolutionary, selectionist and adaptationist process. Our cognitive abilities evolved for a particular purpose in a particular environment. Several interesting experiments were conducted and they all concluded the same thing: we are extremely bad at anticipating future possibilities over a long time and we\u2019re extremely bad at understanding very complex systems, particularly feedback dynamics. If you think about the conditions of our ancestral populations, where a quick response to an imminent threat was the difference between survival or not, then this makes sense. Now, if our mind has an evolutionary history\u2014and that also applies to our cultures, our knowledge systems, our technologies\u2014how far back do we have to go to understand our current situation? And so, we made the argument that you go all the way back, through many of the layers of biological history, to some very early assumptions, processes, and events in the history of life. Our planet is unique because up to two-thirds of the minerals that we have here on Earth, we haven\u2019t found in any other celestial body. And we haven\u2019t found any other body where there is life. The unique mineral evolution of this planet is a co-evolutionary event between the history of life and geological history. The crucial molecule here is oxygen, which is a product of living processes. Having oxygen in the atmosphere changed the mineral composition of this planet, and now, of course, that becomes a resource. Now, in many ways, the basis for the technosphere is facilitated by some of those very ancient products of co-evolutionary events. We are now able to completely redistribute the chemical and geological structures of this planet, but to what effect, and what are the consequences of that? X: Phosphorus history, and I mention it as history, is not very old, and can be used as an example of how things can happen. You mentioned that we are not able to project into the future very well. It\u2019s like being in a rowboat. We are rowing, and we see time passing, but we cannot see what\u2019s coming. But out of this passing we can reconstruct and try to extrapolate into the future. That\u2019s what happened to phosphorus. Phosphorus as an element was discovered in the seventeenth century for the purpose of synthesizing gold. And this poor guy, Hennig Brand in Hamburg, he tried to create gold. He was an alchemist. He concentrated the urine of horses, because it was yellow, so he thought there must be gold in it. He concentrated a concentrate day by day. He had a little bit of phosphorous, which he ignited, and it gave this phosphoric light. He was really astonished. He knew only that he didn\u2019t invent gold, but that he had a new experience, and he made a business out of it, without knowing what was going on. In the seventeenth century nobody knew about the phosphate function. But in the nineteenth century, when agriculture became industrialized and agrichemicals were brought into the fields, phosphorous became very important. And, just as a side note, agriculture invents the means to collect solar energy and transform it into biological systems through photosynthesis. If agriculture uses more energy than it collects, it\u2019s about business. In the last one hundred years, we\u2019ve changed our agriculture to use at least five times more fossil energy than we collect from solar. Phosphorus plays an important role in fertilizers and agrichemicals, and fertilizers were introduced to increase crops and subsequently business. At first we transported guano from the islands of Guano. This is a kind of bird shit. But that was very limited. Now, geology comes into play, because there are huge rocks, phosphate rocks\u2014in Morocco, in the US, in China\u2014and people began to use phosphorus rocks on the fields. To some extent, these geological mines contain not only phosphate\u2014calcium phosphate\u2014but also lead and mercury, and cadmium phosphate. If you unintentionally take a resource, the resource dictates what you have to do. You can take something and use it, but you have to expect that there are other things you also have to take. So nature forces us, as we force nature. Phosphate history shows us how we distribute these mineral resources on our fields, the crop is there, but, over the course of agricultural cycles, the phosphate is washed out, and that\u2019s the end of the game. Phosphate will be distributed in the estuaries and in the oceans all over the planet, in a very high dilution. If you have to recuperate this energy to keep crops growing, we have to pay much more than if phosphorous had been handled consciously. We activate potentials out of the mineral world. We become, to some extent, a slave of these materials. There is no combustion engine made out of copper, because copper wouldn\u2019t support the necessary conditions. So it\u2019s the properties of iron that tells us we can construct a combustion engine. So, in a way, this is a kind of a biography of natural resources. We need to tell these stories, because this is what happens, and because we are still growing. We need to know how far this experience might reach into the future. We have to broaden our sight in order to react to situations we do not really expect. Now, we are only reacting; we need to begin to act. X: I did some work with archaeologists, and what you see, if you go into very early times\u2014in the case of Lascaux, in the Iron Age valley\u2014people painted, and these wall paintings are yellow, brown, red and black. If you go further into the details, you\u2019ll see that these artists came to know iron oxides, because they found out that if I heat it up the color will change. They could influence the color just by heating. This was an outcome of experience, which led to the formation and fabrication of iron. The first steps are artistic steps, in order to functionalize a natural resource for wall painting and cosmetics. I think many inventions were just due to the fact that people were exposed to unexpected new insights into natural realities, and then functionalized these realities. X: Evolution as a species has happened in co-evolution with the technosphere, and if we really go back, can we have an example of this? What does it mean? X: It means that people have used technology for a very long period of time, and that technology has given them advantages in hunting and in collecting, and this has created an environment. Recent discoveries have shown how rich the human species was, how many parallel developments there were. We always imagined this was like a tree, and we are somehow at the uppermost branch. It looks more like a bush, and each of these species were living in a different natural environment, but they also lived in diverse technological environments. Think of the use of fire\u2014fire has had a major impact on the development of human sociality, on landscape management by humans. You have mentioned human consciousness as a technology, but certainly humans were dealing with cultivation long before domestication. Human hunting is an intervention in the environment. It\u2019s not just finding what there is, but intervening, using weapons to do it, and that has had an impact. We can say that the human brain that we have now is not just coming out of a biological world. This reciprocal causality between culture and biology has been going on since Australopithecus, very deep at the root of human evolution. I\u2019ll make a big jump into the present. We are filling all these various niche environments all over the world, from the Tibetan plateau to coastal regions. Now that we have become such a globalized species, we are left with only one niche: the planet has become our niche. As much as we see, in all these historical developments, how context dependencies have shaped past dependencies, now we are filling the entire planet on a globalized scale, and now our trajectory is a common one. Since the age of \u201cout of Africa,\u201d basically, humanity has been connected, and this has only increased with the passing of time through colonization and globalization. We can no longer think of all these niches that I have mentioned in the biological sense, as being isolated from each other. This connectivity is the hallmark of the Anthropocene. But let me backstep a little bit from this ultimate perspective, and see some of the transitions. So, first of all, for a long time people thought that agriculture happened just in one region of the world, in the so-called fertile crescent, in today\u2019s Iran, Syria, and Lebanon. Now we know agricultural food production happened in many different parts of the world. New Guinea is another famous place where this happened. But wherever it happened, it allowed local populations to significantly expand, and to deeply shape their environments in such a way that they could take part of their environments with them. The original European population consisted of migrants from the fertile crescent, who took their animals and their crops with them, enabling them to expand into less densely populated areas, and establish themselves. The history of agriculture is very much connected with the history of human expansion, with the growing of populations, and with the dramatic changes of the ecological environment. Certain environments, plants and animals were favored in such a way that they became a behavioral pattern in human societies. This experience was stored in social institutions, in their cognitive apparatus, and in their material world, to be able to take it away. So did agriculture somehow lead more or less automatically to this scaling up, to this expansion, that we saw after the Industrial Revolution? We have to look at the Industrial Revolution\u2014which has been proposed by many as the starting point of the Anthropocene\u2014and what happened there. Is there just one pathway through industrialization? Were there historical alternatives to it? And then, is the kind of industrial agriculture, using phosphorus and nitrogen, an unavoidable consequence of the Industrial Revolution? People at the time, before they found nitrate-based fertilizers, were thinking that they had a major problem, because so many people were predicted to starve, and then a few scientists invented the Haber\u2013Bosch process. That helped to\u2014as they said at the time\u2014create bread from air. Now we have made ourselves dependent on this particular innovation. This is not Alexander\u2019s conquest of the Hellenistic world. This happened in laboratories, and yet the consequences are enormous. I think the Anthropocene invites us to rewrite history, in this sense. X: The history of science, and especially the history of technology, offers many insights in relation to this. The first that occurs to me is the typical Needham question\u2014you have different societies with the same technological knowledge, so why does a certain society develop in one direction, and the other one not? In the case of the Industrial Revolution, what comes first\u2014capitalism or the technological developments? And how does this new form of economics influence the organizational, technological, and social structure of society, and the development of industrialization? X: I think this history of expansion is a really important thing for us to talk about, and to think about industrialization as coming out of colonization. So to think about colonization, and the history of European colonization, as a kind of proto-capitalism is important, and, in that, I think we get into this relationship between structure and agency that\u2019s been missing from our conversation. X: We need to look at the situatedness of colonization, and not treat Europe as a global model. In that respect, France colonized Haiti to set up sugar. Britain colonized Barbados and set up sugar. Spain set up sugar in Cuba. These historical connections are specific, and I think the one thing that I keep hearing in this discussion is this notion of a single total system that consumes the planet, consumes biology, consumes the human, consumes culture. But really, what we need to be thinking about is systemness\u2014yes, but also the situatedness of the technosphere. For example, I study the phosphate fertilizer industry in central Florida. I don\u2019t study it as one system that pervades the globe. We\u2019re all made out of Florida phosphate; at the same time, we\u2019re also made out of Moroccan phosphate and Chinese phosphate. So there, in my research, I\u2019m interested in the particular landscape changes associated with this one industry, and specifically the different waste products that it produces, including phosphorous, which becomes waste after it has become a commodity, and which is used in agriculture. And, in so doing, all I\u2019m able to do is grapple with what kinds of species were there before, and what kinds of species are there afterwards. I can\u2019t really talk about evolutionary processes, but I can talk about assemblage change. X: I work on agriculture and the history of agriculture in the US Great Plains, where agriculture was capitalized before it was industrialized, and this was made possible by the colonization of the western United States. The land there was so cheap. It was so rich in carbon, because it hadn\u2019t been farmed on a large scale, that settlers were able to produce wheat cheaply, and sell it to Europe. This then displaced and shut down more sustainable farming systems in Europe, which had integrated animals in with the crops and which used cover crops that restored nitrogen, whereas in the American West this was not immediately necessary. Then, of course, over time, you end up with this situation that we are now hearing about, where the soil\u2019s depleted. This more sustainable farming system in Europe was destroyed by the global market for wheat, and then the Haber\u2013Bosch process is like a miracle that lets the whole system keep going, but with a much lower energy return on investment. Now you have to use a lot more fossil fuel to produce the same amount of crop. X: I find the concept of the technosphere too limited to cope with the possible responses to the challenges of the Anthropocene. I would insist on the role of human actors, and I would insist on the potential that humans have\u2014individually and through historical accumulation in their societies and on a species scale\u2014to deal with the challenges of the external world. I think this process has very often been captured in rather reductive ways, and there are many ways to do this reductively. One is to put human actors on a par with nonhuman actors\u2014and I don\u2019t mean biological actors but nonbiological material actors\u2014and I think that takes away, for no reason that I can really comprehend, the special qualities of human agencies. And another reductive way, coming from the history of science, was to consider human intellectual history as purely intellectual history, neglecting the material dimension, the technosphere dimension, and the social dimension. In my professional environment, I have observed, for many years, that people play off against each other those different dimensions. They either insist on the old-school intellectual history or they reduce it to social history, as in the social constructivism of science, or to the material, which is the latest brand that I have observed where the reality sometimes takes on oracular qualities\u2014it\u2019s the source of invasion, it\u2019s the source of contingency of the unexpected, and so on. Let\u2019s take all these dimensions equally seriously\u2014the social dimension, the material dimension, and the human capacity coded in our brains to act as actuaries. As you were saying, human freedom is somehow part of this formula. It\u2019s always a highly constrained freedom and it doesn\u2019t make much sense to frame it abstractly as a residual category of other constraints. We have shaped this world on a planetary scale that is bringing us to the dilemma of the Anthropocene. Yet, in order to address those issues, we also need knowledge as a resource. We talked earlier about nuclear energy and what a good idea it would be to just stop it globally now. I totally agree, but even if you did that now you would still have to maintain some of the knowledge about nuclear, radioactive materials, about transportation research, about deposits. You have to deal with what we have created, and therefore you need knowledge. I want to know something about what we need in terms of knowledge in the future. Knowledge production is highly canalized. Normally, knowledge production is highly constrained by commercial capitalist interest; much of the knowledge production is not done in the universities, it\u2019s the big corporations that produce the knowledge that we get\u2014not necessarily the knowledge that we need, but the knowledge we get is produced there. The universities and academic institutions are almost a fringe phenomenon compared with that, so are we really producing the knowledge that we need in order to address the challenges of the Anthropocene? X: The knowledge people use now is produced by the technosphere. We measure and produce sensors which substitute our senses, and I think we should also think about how to perceive what happens if our senses are substituted by sensors. X: One of the characteristics of the technosphere is that it produces primarily knowledge based on technocratic rationality, which is interested in means but not the larger ends. It\u2019s not about thinking about big paradigm-shifting or episteme-shifting changes but about how to solve problems within parameters that have been pre-established as naturalized and unquestioned. It\u2019s not just natural science that\u2019s being funded and paid for by the corporations, it\u2019s all knowledge production. X: A quotation by Marshall McLuhan from Understanding Media says \u201chuman beings are the sexual organs of machines, we are like bees pollinating machines so that they can reproduce.\u201d This is very much an idea of a technosphere that grows independently of human intention, human actions and decisions. What underlies McLuhan\u2019s fear of media is probably part of what we need. What McLuhan meant is a reversal of the relation between means and those making use of those means, so the means become the aim in themselves. The machines that are extensions of our organs become the aim of reproduction and continue the technology or the media; our actions as human beings become functional. And the approach to the technosphere seems to me to be a similar pattern, or model, of understanding action and technology. X: I just want to briefly gloss over one particular theory that I think might be useful in terms of thinking about agency slightly differently. Elizabeth Grosz develops a concept, not of Darwin\u2019s natural selection, but of sexual selection, and she argues by way of sexual selection that technology is inherently a part of many different forms of life. It cannot be reduced to the human sphere. So, in that sense, the technosphere can\u2019t be directly correlated only to humans. She uses all kinds of birds and other creatures in the world who build various architectures to enhance sexual selection, but that put the species continuity in danger. The only reason why there is this excess is an artistic quality of life that refutes a division between humans and other animals. X: Sexual selection is not really a problem because it still optimizes different demands. If it enhances reproductive success but diminishes survival rates, you still calculate an optimum. However, if there is a runaway selection process where you get a tight link between the choice of a particular trait and the exaggeration of the trait, that\u2019s a very unique phenomenon. It\u2019s technically limited compared with the other cases of sexual selection, but if that happens then you run down into a dead-end street. But you don\u2019t have to call it sexual selection, because there can be runaway selection processes for other characteristics. We create interdependencies that can only go in one direction and we can\u2019t really turn around anymore. You have a characteristic that gets exaggerated if you have a female preference for this characteristic. And if there\u2019s variation in the system, it would lead to more and more exaggerated characteristics and you can\u2019t reverse that system from the intrinsic dynamic because of that close link between preference and exaggeration. So it only goes in one direction, because of the tight link between those two properties of characteristic and choice. If you extract it from the sexual case to interdependency, then this becomes an interesting question in the technosphere. X: I think there are many examples in technology. There are runaway feedback loops\u2014the arms race is a good example, and the nuclear arms race was something where with each little increment you could see why you thought you needed to take the next step, but the whole thing was becoming just really out of control and dangerous. X: Our incapacity to imagine futures has also been a spur to technological change, such as books and photo albums. I wonder if you can speak a little bit about the biological underpinnings of why it might be evolutionarily advantageous not to be able to imagine many futures [laughter]. There are insurance companies, there are actuarial tables, worst-case-scenario thinking, and even science fiction. I think there is some empirical ground on which we can start to look at the institutions that have been created to imagine futures\u2014maybe you begin with the church, I don\u2019t know. How far forward you project tells you a lot about the power relations embedded in just the asking of the question. Insurance companies will project about one hundred years, oil companies a little further. X: We always talk about the loss of biodiversity but we also have to talk about the loss of cultural diversity; there may be resources that we will eventually need in order to cope with some of the challenges. There\u2019s a richness of local knowledge. If we look at the history of Western knowledge, it\u2019s a fiction. Ultimately, there is no such thing as Western knowledge. It\u2019s patched together from many local knowledge traditions. It\u2019s globalized knowledge from the beginning. If you follow the history of knowledge, the history of science, you always see that it starts from very contingent local circumstances. Some knowledge that looks very global now is just global because of a certain trajectory. It\u2019s partly a trajectory of power relations but it\u2019s also a trajectory of exponential relations. My example is always navigation strategies. There are these wonderful Micronesian navigator strategies which master the same challenges of seafaring as Western technologies, which partly come from China, partly come from the Islamic world, and so on, but the difference is they\u2019re confined to zones near the Equator. We need to capture this richness of local knowledge in order to cope. Think of the energy needs of the technosphere. In the nuclear age people were dreaming about one solution to the energy problem. I\u2019m convinced there is no one solution. There will be many locally very diverse sustainable solutions and that is presently prevented by what Manfred would call canalization structures\u2014we have energy systems with this enormous inertia. But that inertia is not just the technological inertia; it\u2019s inertia of strong power structures. So if we want to solve this problem of the richness of cultural approaches or ways of understanding energy, time, and space, we need to break both the inertia of the technosphere and the persistence of those power structures. That\u2019s the challenge we\u2019re up against. X: There are so many positions\u2014not just around this table but around the world\u2014it\u2019s good to remember that and to capture them, not just as part of one uniform whole but including its controversies.",

Yet, given time, even plastic will break down, although it will not decompose. If it breaks and ends up in a landfill, what might it look like several decades from now, or in half a century? If it is washed out to sea, what will be left of it after a hundred years of the persistent forces of waves and sunlight? In truth, I have no idea. I do not know the chemistry of decay, nor the exact make-up of this measuring tape. The value of this imaginative exercise, for me, lies elsewhere. My measuring sheep lends some form to my thoughts about the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene is a big word that is generating many others. It makes me feel a little tired. This measuring tape is the product of greater technological developments, as well as of standardization\u2014standardization that simultaneously enables collaboration, trade, and communication, and feeds into global hegemony and the loss of diversity. Given its material composition, it will outlast me. However, drawing the imagined future of a measuring sheep helps me scale down in time and space; from the caveman\u2019s fire, the steam engine, or nuclear physics, to what my hand holds here and now.

But with the right magical object\u2014perhaps a plastic card attached to a lanyard, an official form printed on thin A4 paper, or a PDF with a digital signature\u2014it is possible to officially breach the formal boundaries around dams, rail networks, oil refineries, weapons factories, and waste processing facilities like the Western Treatment Plant in Melbourne, Australia. Totaling more than 110 square kilometers, the Western Treatment Plant (WTP) is, according to official documents, almost as big as Disney World and is one of the largest and most advanced sewage transformation sites in Australia. This self-powered facility is spread across farmland near the suburb of Werribee on the coastal plains beside Port Phillip Bay, a region where the Wathaurung people\u2014the traditional owners of the land\u2014fished, foraged, and shaped their surroundings in the centuries before the plant began operating in 1897. The WTP is now run by Melbourne Water, a government-owned, permit-granting body that decides what gets in and out of the city\u2019s water system and its infrastructures. Of course, human waste has the ultimate level access to the WTP: A direct line runs into the facility through roughly thirty kilometers of pipes and drains. Waste is not all that gets in: There is also a ghost town, once inhabited by sewage workers, now used to exhibit work by local artists; and there are shallow lagoons where bacteria are encouraged to metabolize excrement, their work interrupted only by human \u201cpoo divers\u201d who emerge from the ponds\u2014victorious and feces-covered\u2014after mending broken equipment. Waste draws film crews, too: Set designers have currently turned one section of the plant into a rural village in sub-Saharan Africa. Birds come in their thousands, some from as far away as Siberia, followed by birdwatchers who require their own permits to visit the protected wetlands inside the plant. And on a brisk, sunny day in August, a range of invasive species\u2014anthropologists, geographers and other social scientists interested in human waste\u2014were given permission to ask the plant and its workers some questions about the future.",

One of our guides, Paul Balassone, the Principal of Cultural Heritage at Melbourne Water, explains that storm surges are already disrupting certain processes at the plant. Wearing a high-visibility vest and steel-toed boots, he gestures through the windows of the bus to the waste-filtering lagoon systems outside, which contain massive ponds that are barely above sea level. Although the plant is prepared for risks, a projected rise in sea level of one hundred centimeters or more over the coming century is still a hard-to-imagine scenario. Traveling deeper within the plant, we pass fields of canola grown with recycled sewage water, disused stables for the thousands of livestock that once grazed here, and Lollypop Creek with its unseen population of growling grass frogs\u2014endangered amphibians who seem to enjoy the altered ecology of the facility. Finally, the bus approaches the biosolids: tall mounds of dry, insoluble, nonbiodegradable waste that has passed through the bodies of Melbourne residents over the past decades. These human-made geological formations loom over the bus, silently holding toxins and sparkling with minerals. Balassone tells us that the managers of the plant are not quite sure about what to do with all of this biomatter, and invite us to think of potential uses.

We \u201cfeel\u201d modern through the speed with which we can travel, our ability to see the city at night, and the comfort of not living beside open sewers\u2014all symptoms of functioning infrastructures. The kind of zeitgeist-chasing or zeitgeist-generating artwork that fills the world\u2019s festivals, fairs, biennials, and triennials, however, lets us sense a different kind of time: contemporaneity. Circling the mounds and the other sites of artwork at the WTP reveals an unexpected alignment. Both infrastructures and contemporary art are time-governing mechanisms. They are strange, enormous clocks. We see more of this control in Cocoroc, a once-lively town within the WTP that existed from 1894 to 1973 for workers and their families. Leaving the bus, we wander past the few remaining buildings, kept as traces of the plant\u2019s history. The surviving town hall, swimming pool, and full-sized sports field are now in various states of preservation, used for public-facing events like the Treatment festival.

The Terragami kit is the starting point for folding words and terms into objects while we are communicating in discussion. Terragami allows us to fold questions and answers, thoughts and feelings in a playful way. Since terraforming is a global 3-D process, we suggest moving from drawing diagrams and writing text to folding words and thoughts.

In its first two months, Aerocene initiated collaborations with numerous scientists, engineers, and designers in institutions on Exhibition Road, investigating topics as diverse as aerial biodiversity sampling and cosmic dust collection. The initiative also included invitations to students, post-doctoral-, and other researchers: Aerocene Hack 1 at Imperial College Advanced Hackspace took place over the weekend of October 28\u201231, 2016, and resulted in several proposals for changes and additions to Aerocene hardware and software, including modifications to the\u00a0Aerocene Explorer\u00a0interface and applications for photogrammetry and air-pollution monitoring. Aerocene Hack 2 then unfolded over the weekend of November 25\u201227, 2016, and connected directly to the first Aerocene Campus.

The invitation of the Aerocene Campus was to ask how, collectively, we can \u201chack\u201d the Anthropocene to co-create the Aerocene. The three zones of\u00a0Free Flight, Life in the Air, and\u00a0Sounding were elaborated by three panels of experts, provocateurs, reporters and communicators from the diverse fields of geography, anthropology, philosophy, microbiology, design, engineering, music composition and programming, among others. The panelists and speakers included: Tom\u00e1s Saraceno (Studio Saraceno), Sir Brian Hoskins (Imperial College London), Bill McKenna (MIT EAPS), Bronislaw Szerszynski (University of Lancaster), Pete Adey (Royal Holloway), Harriet Hawkins (Royal Holloway), Anne Jungblut and Holger Thues (Natural History Museum), Nick Shapiro (Public Lab), Andreas Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos (University of Westminster), Hannah Meszaros-Martin (Goldsmiths), Derek McCormack (University of Oxford), Sven Steudte (Radioamateur Freifunk), Federico Bolza (Sony Music), Sam Hertz (Independent Artist and composer), Ronald Jones (RCA) and Nerea Calvillo (Warwick University). Building the web between technical and conceptual work was an important challenge and the highlight of the campus. A group of advanced technical hackers who had responded to the open call for Aerocene Hack 2 joined the Aerocene Campus for the opening panels, and shared ideas about how they would develop some of the topics of discussion into technical hacks for the Aerocene. There were certainly many highlights in the discussion and working sessions, although only a few can be detailed here. In particular, the Free Flight Panel included a demonstration by Bill McKenna of the new Aerocene flight-prediction interface developed jointly by MIT and Studio Saraceno among other partners. McKenna demonstrated how potential Aerocene pilots could input their launch site and destination, in order to witness the path an Aerocene sculpture would take to catch the right winds and to achieve the destination goal. Bronislaw Szersynski responded to this demonstration with thoughts on \u201cgreat fluid motion\u201d and the dispersal of seeds, while Pete Adey added comments on the darker connotations of levitation, ascension, and drift. These words resonated in Harriet Hawkins\u2019 address at the end of the panel, which considered the imaginary quality of \u201cflights of fancy\u201d from the climbs of Alexander von Humboldt to contemporary art\u2012science practices.",

After walking over quickly to the launch site, Campus participants listened to an impromptu lecture on cloud-formations by Sir Brian Hoskins as\u00a0Aerocene Explorer lifted gently off the grass in the garden, held by Daniel Schulz and Alexander Bouchner. After returning to the RCA, the afternoon panel sessions began with\u00a0Life in the Air. Anne Jungblut and Holger Thues presented their proposal for a collaboration between Aerocene and the Natural History Museum through a citizen science project to monitor lichens, microbes, and other living things in the air over Exhibition Road. Andreas Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos considered the affective resonance of Aerocene Explorer and the lawscapes of the air, while Nick Shapiro related how a project such as Aerocene could also meaningfully contribute to the monitoring of various airborne pollutants, or what he termed, \u201cdeath in the air\u201d. Hannah Meszaros-Martin drew these conversations together with her thoughts on the colonial legacy of exploration and how this should become a critical element of discourse in the Aerocene. What are the potential applications of\u00a0Aerocene Explorer\u00a0to sensing ultrasound and infrasound and of participating in forms of mesh-network communication in the stratosphere? After a micro-lecture by Alexander Bouchner on geo-fencing and cut-down mechanisms, the\u00a0Sounding\u00a0panel began with a talk from radioamateur Sven Steudte on the audible sounds of tracking and data transmission in the 2016 flight of\u00a0Aerocene Gemini. A discussion between Federico Bolza, Sam Hertz and Derek McCormack followed. Hertz reflected on infra- and ultrasound, how Aerocene sculptures might act as floating \u201cears\u201d for sonic adventures, while McCormack told stories of historical aerostatic envelopes in the UK and abroad, asking what are the modes of address that would allow us to release an entity into the air in an exuberant or joyful mode, rather than one of suspicion or foreboding. Bolza drew from his experience in the music industry to ask whether it might be possible to relinquish the modes of control that have dominated the logics of transportation, extraction, and resource-use in the Holocene given the right sensory and sonic lures in the Aerocene.

Here, participants were faced with the dilemma of how they might transform the day\u2019s experience into realizable action. A hint of concern surfaced here, as some voices lamented that there had not been more time to turn concepts into actions, while other voices expressed the value in the process of the campus itself, and in the intangible work of sharing time and stories as well as imaginaries of the future. Nevertheless, several ideas emerged for future collaboration, helped greatly by the fact that the Aerocene team intends to develop a system of lending\u00a0Aerocene Explorer\u00a0sculptures to users across London and the UK. Although the participants had already witnessed a launch, they were offered the possibility of organizing still others of their own, and designing experiments and projects to animate future launches. Even more concretely, the energy and tenor of the Aerocene Campus were channeled into Aerocene Hack 2. This hackathon event continued throughout Sunday afternoon, with final presentations at the Imperial College Advanced Hackspace. The presentations included also work by Cambridge-based engineers Adam Greig, Jamie Wood, and Daniel Richman with their flight-prediction interface for helium balloons with updates and modifications for the additional factors affecting Aerocene sculptures, including thermal absorption of the membrane depending on the position of the Sun in relation to the Earth. Grace Papas, a student at Imperial College, presented the \u201cAerobeak\u201d \u2012 an idea for a moth-capturing device attached to the shrinking membrane of an Aerocene sculpture. Alexander Bouchner and Daniel Schulz proposed a net-based capturing device attached to the payload of\u00a0Aerocene Explorer. And Nick Shapiro elaborated on the work of Public Lab, where he is the Open Air fellow working on devices for activist-monitoring of aerial toxicity. The group was fortunate that Glenn Fierl and Lodovica Ilari skyped in from the MIT for the presentations and offered comments. Tom\u00e1s Saraceno expressed deep thanks to each of the participants and to the organizers of Imperial College Hackspace for their support of the hacking sessions over the weekend, and the event adjourned on an upward current, a stream of floating. The relationship and resonances between the Aerocene and Anthropocene Campus are many, but a few deserve special mention here. First, both campus events witnessed the potential as well as the pain of accommodating such a wide range of expertise, and in doing so, risking the privileging of some over others. Although carefully negotiated in both cases, one does wonder whether better platforms for addressing such a variety of language and expertise are yet to be constructed. Important in both the Aerocene and Anthropocene Campus was an emphasis on experimentation, and an attention to the risks associated with following an experiment outside of one\u2019s comfort zone. Finally, although the formats of a week-long Anthropocene Campus and a one-to-two-day Aerocene Campus are quite different, both favored provocation, spontaneity, interaction, and speculation. There might still be other relationships. Just as the Aerocene Campus can trace a lineage back to the Aerocene launch during the \u201cKnowing in the Anthropocene\u201d seminar (co-taught by Bronislaw Szerszynski, Zoe L\u00fcthi, Melanie Seghal, Pablo Suarez, Janot Mendler de Suarez and myself in April 2016), perhaps the future of both Aerocene and the Anthropocene Campus will remain linked. Perhaps they will spark still other campus-curricula for the myriad other futures this planet urgently needs. Indeed, as this final design suggests, future Aerocenes and Cthulucenes are likely kin.",

The Anthropocene, both by definition and in the idea it encapsulates, can be considered as the largest feedback system experienced by human beings: the Anthropocene concept emerged when Earth-related issues started to impact humans in a feedback loop. Here, our main aim is to discuss the concept and implications of feedback, a step that we believe is central to a better understanding of the Anthropocene. To do so, we mainly use biological analogies, because concepts such as robustness, homeostasis, and feedback loops have been studied extensively in that field. Following this viewpoint, Earth\u2019s homeostasis is comparable to that of a dynamic biological system experiencing multiple feedback loops. This naturally leads us to the concept of niche construction, through which our larger habitat becomes part of our own ontology. Last, we discuss frameworks that may help us to understand the interactions between humans and Earth\u2019s homeostasis, and even to question our exact relationship to planet Earth.",

The Anthropocene, thus, can be defined as a time when humans are changing the homeostasis of the planet. Homeostasis (a term derived from the Greek words \u1f45\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 + \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, meaning \u201cthe same situation\u201d) generally refers to the maintenance of stable conditions in a system. In fact, biological systems are characterized by the homeostasis of their internal parameters (e.g. concentration of biological substances, energy levels, etc.). For instance, the fact that the human body has a constant temperature of 37 \u00b0C under normal physiological conditions is well known, and any deviation from this status is a signal that \u201csomething is wrong\u201d; everybody has experienced the discomfort of a fever. Taking the human body as an example is indeed appropriate: the term \u201chomeostasis\u201d was proposed for the first time in around 1930 by Walter Cannon, a physician at Harvard,Walter B.

                "text": "Homeostasis emerges from redundancy and complexity What are the possible indicators of homeostasis? A property of a homeostatic system is resilience, meaning (for our purposes) the ability of the system to buffer external perturbations, and to come back to its internal state. When looking at living organisms, one can see that the number of components involved in this response can play a role in maintaining homeostasis. At an evolutionary level, natural selection is the external perturbation to which species are subjected. We can try to look to the system \u201cbiological species\u201d as a whole, complex system, composed of individuals, which are the result of other \u201ccomponents\u201d (the biological processes). What we call genetic redundancy (that is, the fact that several genes have redundant functions, i.e. are implied in producing similar-working \u201ccomponents,\u201d such as enzymes catalyzing the same reaction) could be seen as a buffering mechanism: the absence of a single gene usually will not lead to major defects, because other \u2012 redundant \u2012 genes or pathways will compensate for the loss. While this applies within a given generation, it also has consequences across generations and in evolution: redundancy is buffering the action of natural selection, notably by limiting the impact of mutations on essential biological functions. One may call this phenomenon \u201cspecies homeostasis.\u201d Incidentally, this is probably one of the main sources of complexity in biology, explaining why biologist are unlikely to be able to \u201cfix a radio,\u201dYuri Lazebnik, \u201cCan a biologist fix a radio? Or, what I learned while studying apoptosis,\u201d Biochemistry. Biokhimii\u0361a, vol. 69, no. 12 (2004): pp. 1403\u20136; first published in: Cancer Cell, vol. 2, no. 3 (2002): pp. 179\u201282. at least in the near future. The relation between homeostasis and complexity actually goes both ways: the multiplication of actors adds robustness to a system and thus increases its homeostasis; conversely, the system can maintain a large number of actors, including defective ones, because multiple redundant pathways are at play. Complexity promotes homeostasis, and, in turn, homeostasis allows the maintenance of complexity. Such reciprocity is also a major driving force for evolution, as defective actors in a given context can become selective advantages when external conditions change. For instance, while sickle cell anemia can be a major health problem, it also provides resistance to malaria, notably through the overproduction of an enzyme called heme oxygenase 1.Ana Ferreira et al., \u201cSickle hemoglobin confers tolerance to Plasmodium infection,&#8221; Cell, vol. 145, no. 3 (2011): pp. 398\u2012409. Therefore, with homeostasis and the maintenance of complexity comes adaptability. This also means that homogeneity and simplification, in contrast, may lead to a reduction in homeostasis, and thus more chaotic and unpredictable behaviors. A landmark of the Anthropocene is precisely this simplification. Satellite images of vast open fields illustrate how humans have switched to homogeneous crop cultivation following the precepts of an \u201cagro-Taylorism\u201d (see also \u201cImaging the Anthropocene\u201d). Thus, either consciously or unconsciously, we have decided to loose a form of adaptability, at a larger scale than ever before. Because of this global simplification, we may have become more vulnerable to external perturbations.",

                "text": "Homeostasis also emerges from feedback mechanisms While redundancy appears an effective means to reach resilience, it also has limits. In particular, the idea that a set of factors leads to similar outputs is over-simplistic. For instance, while building a high-rise, it seems reasonable that a team of engineers and architects is checking for errors. However, at each step of the construction, despite the expertise of personnel, mechanical tests are conducted to control the structural integrity of the building; in other words, the building itself contributes to the next decision during the process of its own construction. This means that in addition to redundancy, resilience also emerges from feedback systems. While in the case of constructing a building, the architects\u2019 initial decisions would dominate over the contribution made by the building in the final design, obviously this is radically different in a biological system. Biology, and homeostasis in biology, cannot be understood without taking into account such feedback. In fact, if we had to postulate the absence of feedback mechanisms in biology, this would mean that every single molecule (or group of similar molecules) has been positioned following a carefully drawn plan, and that it is blind to its environment. Because one of the main features of molecules is that they interact with one another, and thus are highly dependent on their direct environment, this view, of course, is completely wrong. Biological organisms are complex systems, and this means that they are built on the interactions between molecules, cells, and tissues. This implies that feedback occurs at every scale in this context.For an interesting comparison between feedback mechanisms in biology and the theory of relativity, see Johannes Jaeger et al., \u201cRegulative feedback in pattern formation: towards a general relativistic theory of positional information,\u201d Development, vol. 135 (2008): pp. 3175\u201283. In fact, feedback in biology does not stop at the scale of the organism, but also includes the habitat, which in the frame of the Anthropocene is probably the most relevant level. To conclude, while redundancy allows some resilience, homeostasis primarily relies on interactions, and thus feedback systems. Because feedback is often counterintuitive and difficult to grasp (we usually better understand deterministic mechanisms and have trouble with loop reasoning), their contribution to homeostasis remains underestimated.",

                "text": "An origin of the concept of feedback in the Industrial Revolution As to the Anthropocene itself, the concept of feedback probably owes much to the Industrial Revolution, and the first steam machines. One of the most cited examples is the centrifugal governor\u2014also called the \u201cflyball\u201d governor, because of the two massive balls that allowed it to work\u2014developed by, among others, James Watt. The system used very simple physical laws to self-control the amount of steam entering the machine. The \u201cflyball\u201d at the same time was connected mechanically both to the movement generated by the steam engine and to the valve that allowed the steam to enter the engine. Because of the steam engine movement, the \u201cflyball\u201d was rotating on itself. When the movement was too fast, the flyballs started to move upwards because of the increased kinetic energy, activating a system to reduce the aperture of the valve, thus allowing less steam to enter the engine, and in this way reducing the machine\u2019s speed. Eventually, the flyballs returned to their initial position until a new self-regulation occurred.How a Flyball or Centrifugal Governor Works (2012), online animation (accessed 11/06/2015). Later on, the concept of feedback became central in the discipline of cybernetics, founded by Norbert Wiener.\u201cCybernetics,\u201d Encyclopedia Britannica (2015), online (accessed 01/25/2015). The question of control and the way that complex systems organize themselves goes back to the mechanisms allowing such organization, and most particularly feedback mechanisms. Self-organization is indeed a special kind of homeostasis, and this can be illustrated in the case of pattern formation. An example cited most in evolution and ecology is the Lotka-Volterra model, also called the prey-predator model.Alfred J. Lotka, \u201cAnalytical note on certain rhythmic relations in organic systems,\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 6, no. 7 (1920): pp. 410\u201315; Vito Volterra, \u201cVariazioni e fluttuazioni del numero d\u2019individui in specie animali conviventi,\u201d Memoria della Regia Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, vol. 6, no. 2 (1926): pp. 31\u2013113. In brief, a system of differential equations was adopted to explain the dynamic equilibrium between prey and predator in a given (eco)system. Such equilibrium results in a spatio-temporal \u201cpattern\u201d (figure 1a).",

                "text": "Feedback properties: Lessons from biology Feedback is of two kinds: either negative or positive. To illustrate the case of positive feedback, let\u2019s take the example of the pepsin protease, an enzyme that digests proteins in the stomach. This protein is secreted as an inactive form, called pepsinogen. When pepsinogen reaches the stomach lumen, a small sub-part is cleaved, and the remaining protein becomes pepsin, the active enzyme. The positive feedback lies in the step of pepsinogen cleavage: the enzyme responsible for this step is pepsin itself. In other words, pepsin synthesis requires pepsin. This mechanism ensures compartmentalization of protein degradation domains (pepsin would also digest the internal content of the cell was it not synthesized and secreted as an inactive precursor) and this example illustrates one property of positive feedback: positive feedback reinforces a starting trend. In the case of pepsinogen and pepsin, feedback ensures a rapid start to digestion by amplification of the enzymatic capacities. This is of course one of the defining points of the Anthropocene: the \u201cGreat Acceleration,\u201d a period of growth-amplification for all sectors, is typically the result of a positive feedback loop. As shown in biology, and because of their amplifying power, such positive feedback mechanisms are able to generate major changes from very subtle fluctuations. This also means that fluctuations should not be considered white noise: they can trigger positive feedback, potentially leading to complete chaos. This threat is one of the reasons why the Anthropocene attracts so much attention. As biological systems are relatively far from behaving chaotically (for instance, similar shapes are maintained in a given species and across generations), positive feedback must be channeled in living organisms. As shown in all biological systems, negative feedback systems usually take over to stop the spirals fueled by positive feedback. For instance, the increase in body temperature brought on by fever is an effective way to increase the efficiency of enzymes, which work sub-optimally at 37 \u00b0C, and work optimally at 38 or 39 \u00b0C. Anyone who has experienced fever also knows about the sweating that accompanies it. Perspiration keeps the fever under control by cooling the body, in a negative feedback loop. Ultimately, providing the sickness is benign, this negative feedback loop will prevail and body temperature will stabilize back to 37 \u00b0C. As in biology, one of the keys to the Anthropocene is to identify such positive and negative feedback loops, in order to understand and anticipate the future trajectory of our environment, and our society.",

                "text": "Framing the contribution of humans in Earth homeostasis Such simple biological feedback is so easy to grasp that even intuitive predictions can be made quite safely. However, as we now experience a \u201cdata deluge,\u201d the possible crosstalk and feedback mechanisms have reached a number so high that it becomes impossible for the Human brain to formulate any coherent picture in full confidence.For example, this can be seen in the control of the cell cycle: see James E. Ferrell Jr, \u201cFeedback loops and reciprocal regulation: recurring motifs in the systems biology of the cell cycle,\u201d Current Opinion in Cell Biology: cell cycle, differentiation and disease, vol. 25, no 6 (2013): pp. 676\u201386. doi:10.1016/j.ceb.2013.07.007 In fact, Human intuition is often wrong in such instances. The theory of complex systems, and its application in the form of computer modeling, has thus been developed in recent years to formalize all the possible interactions, notably including feedback, through their formalization in mathematical terms (see \u201cModeling Wicked Problems\u201d). At this point, one may ask what the theoretical framework of the Anthropocene should be, and how to frame humanity in planetary homeostasis. In a time defined by climate change and global threats to ecosystems and resources, we should be able to tell the difference, say, between short-term and long-term trends, human-related ruptures of global homeostasis, and those due strictly to external factors. At the same time, such a general framework would set the basis for rational intervention, and political economic planning. The problem of global stability was approached with particular emphasis in the second half of the twentieth century. Already before, the writing of Russian geochemist Vladimir Vernandsky had settled the concept of the biosphere, that is, the sphere of the planet Earth where life can survive, the so-called \u201cdomain of life.\u201dAndrei V. Lapo, \u201cVladimir I.

The Gaia hypothesis basically states that life can self-regulate the biosphere, therefore creating a planetary homeostasis suitable for sustaining life. Such homeostasis would be achieved mainly through different negative feedback mechanisms. The Gaia hypothesis stemmed from a fictional model called Daisyworld,Ibid. in which an extremely simple biosphere was taken into account. In this model, the surface of the planet is imagined covered by a single species of \u201cdaisies.\u201d These \u201cfictional\u201d organisms can exist in two phenotypic forms (black or white). Here the external factor acting upon the system is radiation from the Sun. A prerequisite is the existence of an \u201coptimal temperature\u201d at which these \u201cdaisies\u201d can live. In this model, \u201cdaisies\u201d would be able to self-regulate the temperature of the planet-surface because lower radiation will favor \u201cblack-daisies\u201d (resulting in a temperature increase), and higher radiation will favor \u201cwhite-daisies\u201d (resulting in higher albedo). Several authors have analyzed the Gaia hypothesis critically and from several points of view.Book review (The Gaia Hypothesis: Science on a pagan planet, by Michael Ruse), \u201cExploring our Love/hate relationship with Gaia,\u201d New Scientist (August 23, 2013), online (accessed 11/02/2015). However, the theory aims to be coherent with natural selection, and can probably be merited with pushing scientists to investigate true life-based feedback on Earth (such as the role of forests on land or algae-produced dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in oceans).Timothy M. Lenton, \u201cGaia and natural selection,\u201d Nature, vol. 394, no. 6692 (1998): pp. 439\u201347. doi:10.1038/28792 Moreover, even without any relationship to the theory proposed by Lovelock, it paved the way to thinking differently about negative feedback.",

                "text": "Some prospects Let\u2019s look ahead. Some practical solutions to current environmental threats and Anthropocenic challenges have already emerged. For instance, geoengineering strategies are envisioned to mitigate the greenhouse gas effects on the atmospheric temperature. In that scenario, the boundaries of human organisms, in fact, would extend to that of the planet and its atmosphere, shortcutting a large number of intermediates. Importantly, this reduction in complexity also implies that the number of potential buffering mechanisms would be reduced. Here comes the question: Is this global simplification concerning our interaction with the environment not a major tipping point in our evolution and maybe one of the most emblematic landmarks of the Anthropocene? Here, biology stresses that such simplification would be extremely harmful to the planet\u2019s homeostasis. With the increase of the human impact on the planet, not only has our environment deteriorated, but also its dynamic has been modified dramatically. Fluctuations occur faster, meaning that feedback is less predictable and may be more difficult to channel. If the impact of humanity on the environment is starting to have a dominant effect on Earth, this may hinder the buffering effect of a more balanced complex system. This could be one of the many definitions of the Anthropocene: an era where ecosystem homeostasis is threatened by one of its dominating elements, humanity, and thus a time when the ecosystem becomes vulnerable and to some extent unpredictable, because both humanity and its environment cannot be decoupled anymore. Beyond technology and Earth sciences, one of the most fascinating research subjects for the future is the contribution of human psychology in our relationship to Earth. In this respect, an understudied subject within the frame of the Anthropocene is the process of decision-making. In general, humans tend to take a conservative approach; when it is time to decide between two options, the conservative option, i.e. the one that is consistent with the past context, is the more likely to be picked. Such conservatism has been largely demonstrated, whether it relates to buying habits or maintaining relationships.Robert-Vincent Joule, Petit trait\u00e9 de manipulation \u00e0 l\u2019usage des honn\u00eates gens. Grenoble: PUG, 2004. In other words, humans are not revolution-prone. In the context of the Anthropocene, such a strong bias in decision-making should be included, because it would have a major impact on the evolution of the planet, and thus on humanity indirectly. Another field in which it is crucial to explore anthropocenic feedback mechanisms is that of education. One may expect that with better knowledge of environmental issues, humanity as a whole will decide to stay away from consumerism, which is one, if not the main, cause of the Anthropocene (also called \u201cCapitalocene\u201d to reflect its economic roots). Consistent with this scenario, sustainable development strategies, alternative modes of consumption and financing, are blooming everywhere: Is this enough to generate a positive feedback loop on education and to amplify this change in human civilization? Two critical points should be raised here. Sustainable development will remain an oxymoron, and thus a marketing trick, as long as development remains within the framework of unlimited economic growth. Second, the worldwide shortage of resources is fueling tensions between countries, and this, in turn, may rapidly hinder current educational efforts. In other words, are we going to change our civilization fast enough to overcome this negative feedback on education? Understanding the Earth as a complex system, where multiple feedback loops occur, means that it may also be time to consider our planet as a third party to which we are accountable.Michel Serres, Le temps des crises. Paris: Editions le Pommier, 2009. An immediate consequence of this change of paradigm is that any economic transactions would be weighed up in light of what the planet can or cannot offer, including the various feedback loops, and taking into account the long-term implications. Putting a price on nature, however, is a tricky task (see \u201cValuing Nature\u201d). This can be illustrated by the carbon-quota debate, and the associated risk of deadweight loss. Nevertheless, this is probably where our efforts could be focused. Re-scaling the human\u2012environment nexus, investigating the many implications behind the complexity of our world, considering the psychological and temporal limits of human nature, all of these considerations might help to forecast upcoming feedback outcomes, and their surprises.",

                "text": "The Mississippi River passes through the center of the United States, crossing a large fraction of the North American continent from north to south. Along the river, a multitude of human influences impacts ambient air quality, ranging from agricultural activities, emissions from residential areas and traffic, all the way up to heavy industrial emissions. In addition to man-made local and regional emissions, the transport of airborne substances as well as atmospheric processes influence the ambient concentration of air pollutants in different ways. This results in a complex situation which changes over time not only due to improvements in emission control technology but as a consequence of shifting meteorological situations. In order to investigate the anthropogenic impact onto the air quality along the Mississippi River, we investigated air quality data of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) which were publicly available. What is \u201cair quality\u201d? The term \u201cair quality\u201d describes the composition of ambient air\u2014in terms of trace gases and particles suspended in the air\u2014with respect to their potential influence on human health. Several trace gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), or ozone (O3), can cause adverse health effects and are either directly emitted by anthropogenic activities or formed in the atmosphere by photochemical processes from anthropogenically emitted substances. Airborne particles are either directly emitted into the air (primary aerosol) or are generated in the atmosphere by chemical processes that form condensable species by oxidation of precursor gases (secondary aerosol). Both effects can be the consequence of natural processes (e.g. wind-blown mineral dust, sea salt, or secondary aerosol from biogenic emissions) or the result of anthropogenic activities (e.g. emissions from combustion engines, residential heating or cooking, industrial emissions, etc.). Aerosol particles are generally more complex than trace gases. In addition to their varying chemical composition, the size of these particles also has a strong influence on their health relevance: only particles smaller than approximately 10 \u00b5m in diameter can be inhaled, with smaller particles penetrating deeper into the respiratory system than larger ones. Therefore, for air quality purposes the mass concentrations of particles smaller than 10 \u00b5m, called PM10, and of particles smaller than 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5) are regulated. To provide public health protection, including the health of \u201csensitive\u201d populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly, national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) were set by the EPA as defined in the Clean Air Act, which was last amended in 1990. These air quality standards define maximum levels of several trace gases (CO, NO2, O3, and SO2), of total particulate matter pollution (PM2.5 and PM10), and of particulate lead and corresponding averaging times for these limits. In order to control compliance with the NAAQS standards, the EPA operates a nationwide network of air quality measurement stations, located in urban, suburban or rural locations, which provide hourly averages of pollutant concentrations. Depending on the land use in their closer environment they are classified either as \u201ccommercial,\u201d \u201cindustrial,\u201d \u201cagricultural,\u201d \u201cresidential,\u201d or \u201cforest\u201d stations. How we determined air quality information For the purpose of this study, openly available air quality data were downloaded from the US EPA Air Quality System Data Mart. To cover the Mississippi River area widely, a total of more than 250 air quality stations in a belt along the river with a distance of up to 200 km (Figure 1) were selected. All data for these stations on sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and total particulate matter mass concentration dating back to the beginning of the respective measurements were downloaded and collected in a data base. This resulted in a data set encompassing more than 500 million concentration data points of 1-hour pollutant concentrations for many years, often going back to the year 1990. To reflect the differences in general land use in the northern, central, and southern part of the Mississippi River, stations were separated into three area categories (North, Middle, and South, see Figure 1). In addition, urban, semi-urban, and rural stations, as well as stations with different land use environments (industrial, residential, agricultural\u2026), were considered separately before further analysis. Trends of air pollutant concentrations over decades Temporal trends of pollutant concentrations over several decades mainly reflect how technical developments and emission control measures affect ambient pollutant concentrations. However, they can also be an indicator for economic well-being or crisis. For air quality network stations that fall within many categories (i.e. combination of area category, environmental category and land use category), no complete data sets covering the last 30 years are available due to different numbers of stations in the various categories as well as \u00a0different operation periods of the individual stations. Nevertheless, generally very similar temporal trends were observed for the various pollutant concentrations.",

For PM10, a slight decrease in concentration levels has been observed in the middle Mississippi area (red trace), while no clear trend can be seen for the northern and southern areas (black and green traces). Recently, the New York Times even reported that nationwide the \u201cair quality worsens, ending years of gains.\u201d \u00a0This article was based on the observation of a 5.5 per cent increase in fine particle (PM2.5, particles with diameters up to 2.5 micrometers) concentrations over the last three years compared to the value from 2016 provided by the EPA air quality monitoring network, while the concentrations decreased during the seven years prior. A similar increase was also observed in the PM10 data in the southern Mississippi area (Figure 3, lower panel, green trace). However, when not looking only at the last seven years but at the displayed 30 years, it becomes clear that such variabilities are not uncommon for the particulate mass concentration and are not necessarily indicative of a trend. For ozone, concentration levels seem to even increase slightly over the last thirty years. Even though anthropogenic emissions have been strongly reduced over the last decades, concentrations of some pollutants do not decrease in a similar way. This behavior reflects the fact that it is not only anthropogenic emissions that affect the concentrations of these pollutants; chemical reactions within the atmosphere as well as natural sources of trace gases and particles also do so in a complex manner. Regional differences in pollutant concentrations along the Mississippi River To investigate differences between the three different regions along the Mississippi River, presented in Figure 1 and the different environments, i.e. urban, semi-urban, and rural areas, average pollutant concentrations were calculated for all five criteria pollutants for the last ten years using the data from the respective measurement stations.

                "text": "Generally, in urban and semi-urban areas pollutant concentrations for nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter are enhanced, compared to rural areas. This is due to the fact that in urban areas the corresponding sources, like vehicles, industry, or residential emissions, are more abundant than in rural areas. Ozone is found in higher concentrations in rural areas, compared to urban and semi-urban areas. This is because ozone is depleted by chemical reactions with nitrogen oxides in urban areas and it is photochemically formed in the atmosphere downwind of the sources. These effects cause higher ozone concentrations relatively far away from the source areas and therefore a clear anthropogenic impact in regions which are otherwise relatively weakly affected by emissions from human activities. For sulfur dioxide, no clear dependence on the type of area was found. Here, likely the distance of the individual measurement sites to the main emission sources\u2014i.e. coal-fired power plants and, in the southern region, also emissions from ocean-going ships\u2014dominates the measured SO2 concentrations. When comparing pollutant concentrations for the three regions along the Mississippi River, one can find a general increase in sulfur dioxide concentration from north to south. This is in good agreement with the higher density of population and industrial facilities in the middle and especially southern areas, compared to the northern area which is dominated by forests and natural parks. For ozone, no general trend along the river was found, suggesting that differences in sunlight intensity from the northern end of the Mississippi down to the southern end do not result in strongly different ozone production rates. However, for rural areas, which are less affected by local emissions, smaller ozone concentrations are found in the southern area. This is in agreement with generally higher rural nitrogen dioxide concentrations in this area, compared to those further upstream the Mississippi River. For particulate matter concentrations, no clear trend along the river is found. This likely reflects the fact that aerosol particles are not only generated by anthropogenic activities but also by natural processes. By nature, such analyses can only reflect larger scale and averaged trends for those pollutants which are monitored in the air quality network. More in depth measurements of other toxic pollutants in individual environments can result in very different findings. For example a recently published analysis by ProPublica revealed that while general air pollution indicators have improved over the last decades, \u201ctoxic air pollution in Louisiana\u2019s industrial belt is rising in absolute terms.\u201d Especially in areas in close proximity to heavy polluters like chemical plants, the concentration of harmful substances in the ambient air can be strongly enhanced. Such inhomogeneity in the distribution of pollutants can be missed by the air quality network, depending on the location of the individual stations and due to the fact that not all hazardous air pollutants are monitored. What can we learn from weekly and seasonal variabilities of pollutants? Often, air pollutant concentrations show a regular variability with a clearly visible daily, weekly, or seasonal cycle. Such behavior is an indicator for the underlying emission or formation processes of the respective pollutant and can therefore be used to understand underlying sources. Daily patterns can reflect meteorological influences like dependence on sunlight or air temperature, but also human activities like vehicular traffic cycles or cooking activities. Similarly, yearly cycles can reflect the influence of sunlight or ambient temperature on pollutant concentrations as well as variations in human activity like heating cycles. On the other hand, weekly patterns strongly point towards human influences, since there is no reasonable meteorological effect which occurs on a seven-day cycle. The temporal trends shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 show clear seasonal variability for carbon monoxide (Figure 2, lower panel), and ozone (Figure 3, upper panel) concentrations and a slight seasonal variability for the nitrogen dioxide (Figure 2, upper panel) concentration. For carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, the reason for this behavior is likely a seasonal cycle in the emission of these species. Both pollutants show maximum concentrations in winter, when \u00a0it is probable that emissions from residential heating are strongly elevated and when, potentially, combustion engines run under less optimal temperature conditions more frequently. For ozone, the concentrations are lowest in winter because the photochemical formation of this pollutant depends on the availability of sunlight and therefore this process is less efficient during winter time.",

                "text": "Weekly cycles are shown for the five criteria pollutants in Figure 5. For the concentration of particulate matter (PM10), different weekly patterns are observed for the different types of environment and these patterns are relatively weak. This reflects the fact that both anthropogenic and natural sources contribute to the emission and formation of particulate matter and possibly different kinds of human activities affect the concentrations at urban and rural locations. For carbon monoxide (CO) and especially nitrogen dioxide (NO2) clear weekly cycles can be seen. Since both pollutants are directly emitted from anthropogenic activities, mainly combustion processes, they are directly affected by human activity patterns and show lower concentrations during weekends, compared to weekdays. Ozone (O3), on the other hand, shows a maximum during weekends. This is not due to enhanced emission of ozone or ozone precursor materials but due to reduced destruction of ozone on weekends when nitrogen oxide emissions are lower. For sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations, no clear weekly cycle is found. Even though most of the SO2 emissions are caused by human activities, this is due to the fact that the majority of these emissions are from coal-fired power plants which do operate according to a weekly cycle. Summary To investigate the anthropogenic impact onto the air quality along the Mississippi River, openly available air quality monitoring data provided by the EPA were downloaded and investigated. More than 500 million data sets on five different criteria pollutants, measured in ca. 250 monitoring stations along the river in different environments allowed a detailed analysis of anthropogenic influences. In particular, the concentrations of directly emitted pollutants from combustion processes, like nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, decreased significantly over the last decades. Using weekly and seasonal variabilities, one could associate these pollutants directly with human activities like driving vehicles or heating homes. For other pollutants the situation is more complex due to multiple anthropogenic and natural generation processes (like for particulate matter) or due to complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere (like for ozone). The spatial distribution of pollutants along the Mississippi River and within different environments reflects the distribution of pollution sources with often higher concentrations in more urbanized environments. However, for ozone the strongest impact onto air quality can be observed further away from urban centers.",

Through the arrangement of sound works taking advantage of the natural phenomena known as otoacoustic emissions (propagative inner-ear vibrations), Amacher eloquently demonstrates the physical creative capacities of the body; outside any aspect of the psychological/subjective dimension of perception, Amacher\u2019s works situate the listener in a physically generative position\u2014their ears create novel sonic content within the projected sonic stream. The relationship between the object doing the listening and the object producing the sound, therefore, is instantiated within a more complex space than historically assumed.Maryanne Amacher, &#8220;Sound Characters (Making the Third Ear),&#8221; New York, 1999. Discussing Amacher\u2019s otoacoustic works, Gascia Ouzounian expands on the extent to which, when \u201csound, body, and space meet, new dimensions of, and sensitivities towards, environments can be engaged, and our relationship to these and to ourselves and each other within these can be re-imagined and transformed.\u201dGascia Ouzounian, \u201cEmbodied Sound: Aural architectures and the body,\u201d Contemporary Music Review, vol. 25, no. 1/2, 2006: pp. 69\u201379, here p. 78. Hearing is an environmental mapping\u2014the translation of vibratory trajectories, reflections, and transductions. Amacher\u2019s work and Ouzounian\u2019s reflexive schema of embodied perception and integration suggest even more intimate and affinitive relationships with external environments: not only is one\u2019s perception of sound determined in passing through a nexus of noise, architecture, and nonlinearity, but simultaneously there is a sense in which one extends outward into the space of perception. Further, we should imagine this proposition as a decentering of the human as a closed hearing mechanism, replaced with a conceptualization of the body and the space of perception itself as fluid and porous. Our thoughts and feelings begin to extend farther \u2026 In his description of Tom\u00e1s Saraceno\u2019s Aerocene project, Bronislaw Szerszynski remarks that the Aerocene vision is about going up, but also about opening up [\u2026] and the open body of the Aerocene reminds us of the openness of our own bodies\u2014that living things, like all dissipative system, depend on a constant flow of energy, matter, and information across the boundary that at once divides and joins them and their environment. Aerocene points towards an anthropic transition that would open us up to the more-than-human world.Bronislaw Szerszynski, \u201cUp,\u201d\u00a0The Aerocene Newspaper, 2016, online (accessed May 31, 2016): p. 15. What both Saraceno and Amacher point to is the need to re-evaluate modes of engagement, sensation, and transmission within this open environment. The trajectories of Aerocene aesthetics and otoacoustic emissions accentuate acts of collaboration between human and environmental actors, positing constant translations and transductions across the surfaces on which they intersect. I propose the idea of \u201caero-acoustic arts\u201d to denote equilibrium within objects between the creative capacities of sensation and communication. The ear\u2019s faculty of sensual topology and temporality within the event space of perception is a model for a new relationship to aesthetics in the context of Saraceno\u2019s Aerocene; below, I offer some speculative visions and imaginative states for the extension of the sonic arts into the realm of the Aerocene.

                "text": "The Mississippi is mostly thought of as a superhighway of water, endlessly flowing for some 3,700 kilometers from its source at Lake Itasca\u2014a little south of the Canadian border\u2014to its end in the Gulf of Mexico, into which it discharges about one and a half cubic kilometers of water each day (each average day, that is: In a nationwide drought this can slow to less than half a cubic kilometer, while in flood peaks it can exceed seven cubic kilometers). In the Anthropocene, this superhighway is engineered and polluted, contrasting with the ancient wild river that reaches into, and far beyond, the human peopling of North America that started around the beginning of the Holocene epoch, some 12,000 years ago. Looking at the river through the eyes of geology, though, offers a different perspective, in which that long stretch of water becomes only a minor, if ever-present and fundamental, part of the narrative. The wider river The Mississippi River is a formal human-made construct, chosen and named from the thousands of possible tips of the river system, a dense network that branches out and drains from some 3 million square kilometers of land\u2014about 40 percent of the area of the United States of America. Almost any of these tips that reach the outer edge of the drainage basin might have become the \u201cmain stem\u201d of the river, rather than being artificially relegated as tributaries. Had the end of the Missouri River (or the end of one of its outermost tributaries) been chosen as the main stem of the Mississippi River system, then this would have resulted in a river about 6,000 kilometers long\u2014the fourth longest in the world (after the Nile, Amazon, and Yangtze), rather than being about the seventeenth longest as the Mississippi is currently defined. The ancient river The river is indeed ancient. After all, gravity dictates that rainfall in the central part of the US must first collect and then flow somewhere, and the path taken is constrained to the west by the Rocky Mountains, some 80 million years old, and to the east by the Appalachians, some 400 million years old. The water has therefore been making its way across to the south, to flow into the Gulf of Mexico, since the time of the dinosaurs. The river system itself\u2014including the chosen \u201cmain stem\u201d of the Mississippi\u2014has changed its pattern and course, but not its function, innumerable times since then. Among these changes have been those driven by the fifty or so major glaciations that affected North America in the last 2.6 million years. In the most extensive of these, the Laurentide Ice Sheet periodically extended into the northern part of the Mississippi\u2019s course, effectively bulldozing it out of the way, and leaving this part of the river to find a new course when the ice melted away. Each time the ice sheet melted it formed giant lakes, the water trapped by the remains of ice. Each time an ice dam broke, part of the watercourse made its way south along the Mississippi, to flood into the Gulf of Mexico. There were three major meltwater floods between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago, swelling the flow to an estimated twelve cubic kilometers a day\u2014comfortably exceeding the flood peaks of modern times\u2014which could be sustained for decades or even centuries as these giant lakes drained. Flows on this scale could, and seemingly did, pour enough freshwater into the sea to disrupt the major ocean-current systems, and so affect the global climate. Once the ice had gone, the Mississippi settled into the, more or less, steady and stable pattern of the Holocene epoch. The water kept flowing more sedately. But the solid part of the river system (that is, the accumulated sediment) had by then grown enormous, dwarfing the thin thread of water that had built it. The solid Mississippi In the mid-nineteenth century, the river was already not wholly natural, but it flowed a good deal more freely than it does today. The few scientific measurements that were made then, of the sand and (mostly) mud that the Mississippi carried into the sea were crude, but suggest that some 400 million tons of sediment were being carried annually into the sea, building up, year on year, the Mississippi Delta. This figure is probably representative of the natural river in warm interglacial times; the swollen river of the glacial outbursts would have carried a far greater sediment load. Not all of the sediment makes it to the sea. Much gets dumped along the way, along the beds of river channels and on the banks and, during floods, is draped as swathes of mud and silt across the floodplain, which locally exceeds a width of a hundred kilometers. In this way, the river has built wide landscapes and also concealed clues to the landscape\u2019s history and ecosystems, in the form of buried animal bones and plant debris\u2014and relics of human culture too\u2014caught up in the sediment layers. Some of the clues lie in the form of the sediment layers themselves. In times of ice and permafrost, the swollen and sediment-choked river often split into the innumerable shallow and ever-changing shallow channels of a braided river. This is the kind of river still common in the far north of the continent, where ice still lingers in the mountains; on picking their way across, the early gold prospectors cursed them as being \u201ca foot deep and a mile wide.\u201d Fossilized relics of the more extensive Ice Age braidplains can be found as wide, low plateaus around the modern Mississippi. As the river then swept most of the mud it carried far downstream, the sands and gravels that remained are now avidly sought by humans of the Anthropocene in order to build their own quickly growing concrete ecosystems. In the 7,000 years or so since the ice melted, the Mississippi changed into the form of which it became a classic of its kind: The many shallow channels coalesced into the single, sinuous, and deep channel of a meandering river. This formal adjective nicely captures the sense of the active dynamics. A wild river of this kind is forever migrating across its wide floodplain (in excess of 200 kilometers across in the case of the wild Mississippi) as the current erodes one bank, with sediment building up on the opposite bank to compensate. During the larger floods, the channel can avulse\u2014abruptly switching its course to scour out and flow along an entirely different course within the floodplain. And it is common for the more extravagant meander loops to become closed off as the river breaks through to flow along a shorter path. These abandoned meander loops form crescent-shaped oxbow lakes, which become treasure troves of fossilized leaves and pollen, animal skeletons, and other remains that are buried within their soft, muddy sediments. The sandy deposits, neatly stacked side by side by the actively meandering channel, point to a treasure trove of another kind: The Mississippi has become a classic geological model for ancient river deposits that elsewhere\u2014being porous and permeable\u2014commonly contain oil and gas. It is a double-edged kind of treasure, as the exploitation of these hydrocarbon deposits in analogous places like Alberta helps power the changes that are now transforming the Mississippi of the Anthropocene. The meanders of the Mississippi have ancestors. Here and there, high up on the edges of the modern valley, there are remnants of river strata that date back to before the Ice Ages, to the Pliocene epoch, some 3 million years and more ago. This was a meandering river too, but the fragments of petrified meanders discovered are bigger than those of the Mississippi of Holocene times, and so more water flowed down the older river. Did the river system then have a greater extent, the researchers wondered, perhaps reaching far into Canada? Or, was this simply because there was more rainfall on the North American continent in the Pliocene? It is a significant question. As the Earth\u2019s climate now heats up, we are rapidly approaching a Pliocene epoch kind of a climate (we already have a Pliocene-type atmosphere in terms of carbon dioxide\u2014a greenhouse gas directly linked with climate change\u2014and are waiting for the Earth\u2019s heat balance to reach equilibrium). The Pliocene Mississippi might hold clues as to how an Anthropocene Mississippi could evolve. The Mississippi meets the sea The Mississippi River Delta is another geological classic\u2014again with strong hydrocarbon connotations. The landscape that we see now is of some 12,000 square kilometers of wetlands, which now famously hosts New Orleans, a city that will likely fall victim to its Anthropocene predicament (together with much of the rest of the delta) before this century\u2019s end. The entire system, part of which is underwater, extends over more than 30,000 square kilometers, some 12,000 of which are currently above sea level. Beneath the surface of the delta lie the muds and sands brought in by the river. Over the span of the Holocene, those annual 400 million-ton loads have built into a sediment layer several tens of meters thick, which has been distributed along some 300 kilometers of coastline, as the river has switched to a different outlet to the sea every 1,000 years or so. The currently active Balize Delta, upon which New Orleans is located, was initiated about a millennia ago and now covers an area of about 10,000 square kilometers. Farther west, the Atchafalaya Delta has been developing for the last 400 years and, without the active involvement of the US Army Corps of Engineers, could become the new main route for the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. The latest addition, the nearby Wax Lake Delta, is entirely human generated, resulting from a new artificial channel cut in 1941 and since extended some eight kilometers out to sea. The Mississippi Delta is a highly dynamic system with a filigree subterranean geometry that has also become a geological classic\u2014another, avidly studied guide to where petroleum might be found stored in ancient examples of these strata. Gigantic fingers of sand mark where the channels flowed out to sea, with even larger ones below marking the shifting positions of \u201cmouth bars\u201d of sand just offshore, as they built out to sea, like a slowly moving one-way conveyor belt. These linear masses of sand are encased in muds so soft and plastic that the sheer weight of sediment can make masses of strata deform and flow deep underground. The Holocene-period strata are just a veneer upon the surface of a mass of sediment of some fifteen kilometers thick, poured in by the Mississippi, which has been building up since the Jurassic period. Three of those vertical kilometers relate to the Quaternary period\u2014when the ice sheets accelerated the sweeping of sediment off the North American continent. The weight of that enormous sediment mass has depressed the Earth\u2019s crust, in effect to create space for its own deposition, and thus the surface of the delta throughout that time has stayed at or near sea level. When the sea level rises quickly, much of its surface is drowned; when the sea level falls or remains steady, the delta wetlands build out seawards. The deeper layers of strata that the Mississippi has formed by the ocean\u2019s edge include highly productive oil- and gas fields. And the hydrocarbon connections stretch farther and deeper. Some 300 million years ago, in the Carboniferous period, an even larger and similarly long-lived subsiding delta system produced\u2014by a quirk of geological conditions\u2014much of the world\u2019s deep coal deposits. Formed from the remains of forests drowned by successive sea-level rises and then buried under sediment layers, the area of these coal deposits extend today from the American Midwest and East, and across Western and Eastern Europe. The Mississippi Delta is a prime model for geologists seeking rich coal seams. This Mississippi River and Delta system has been functioning and creating landscapes and strata since the Jurassic period, and rivers and deltas in general have been behaving along these general patterns for 400 million years, since the planetary revolution that took place when forests began to spread across the Earth\u2019s land surface. Now, in the emerging Anthropocene, another revolution is transforming the form and function of river systems. The Mississippi is a major example of this change. The Mississippi today The human impact on river systems, including the Mississippi, did not start in the Anthropocene. The Mississippi was likely changed in some way by the indigenous North Americans through variable deforestation and the introduction of agriculture, with that change accelerated by the early European settlers through agriculture, mining, and urbanization. But the acceleration of change since the mid-twentieth century has been dramatic, even if we are only just beginning to grasp the nature, scale, and implications of this transformation. We only have space here to sketch out a few of its main features. More than 40,000 dams in excess of six meters in height have been built along the Mississippi and its many tributaries, storing water for hydroelectric energy and irrigation\u2014and, for leisure, in order to build lakes for yachting and powerboating. While these dams only briefly stop the inexorable flow of water, they trap much of the sediment, as much as 20 million tons per year, which would otherwise build up the floodplains downstream, and ultimately construct the entire Mississippi Delta. This dam-building process, which is largely an Anthropocene phenomenon, has taken place along virtually all of the world\u2019s major rivers. It followed a late Holocene phenomenon in which a burst of sediment reached the river after forests were cut down for agriculture, making the surrounding landscapes easily erodible. Thus, while substantial Anthropocene strata are rapidly building up behind dams, the Mississippi Delta is now sediment-starved, with estimates through 1970 to 1990 of only 220 million tons of sediment reaching the ocean, nearly half the natural rates. As a result, the delta is no longer growing at its normal rate, and so is yet more vulnerable to drowning through sea-level rise. Indeed, over the last century, a yearly average of about forty-five square kilometers of land on the delta plain is lost through submergence, which is now on average about 0.6 meters lower in elevation than at the start of the Anthropocene. This represents about 80 percent of coastal land loss in the US. The meanders of the Mississippi, which have moved freely since (at least) the Mesozoic times, are now straightened and confined within concrete walls, notably thanks to the work of the US Army Corps of Engineers from the 1920s onward. The lower Mississippi River floodplain is now about 10 percent of its natural width. This protection of agricultural land and real estate has a range of consequences. Perhaps most serious is that floodwaters, prevented from taking the natural escape onto extensive floodplains, attain higher flood heights and water-flow rates, exacerbating the potential impact of flooding in sensitive urban areas. Levee construction also prevents the river sediments from depositing onto river floodplains and delta tops, further increasing the risk of drowning and reducing the natural fertility of the soils. In the delta, levees also cut off the supply of freshwater to the marshlands which are increasingly threatened by intrusion of saltwater, with the potential to have a serious impact on this threatened ecosystem. One consequence that will be worth exploring in future research is the change in how and where the Mississippi sediments now build up to form the distinctive river-strata of the Anthropocene. It will be highly instructive to see how the classic geological model of Mississippi strata\u2014as used by generations of geologists as an example of how such deposits are formed (not least with regard to the search for underground oil and gas)\u2014can be modified by the construction of a sedimentary model consistent with the times and processes of the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene strata of the Mississippi, as well as assuming a fundamentally different geometry, now include a range of new components, different from those of all preceding epochs. A precursor to this Anthropocene record of pollution is the impact of the mining of the Mississippi Valley Type ore deposits\u2014a globally recognized name given to a type of carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits, first recognized in southeastern Missouri, northeastern Iowa, southwestern Wisconsin, and northwestern Illinois. Lead mining first commenced in the mid-seventeenth century and became widespread in the mid-nineteenth century. As lead extraction decreased after a peak of about 25,000 metric tons per year in the 1840s, zinc became the main metal mined from the region, with nearly 60,000 tons per year worked in the first decade of the nineteenth century; the last mine closed in 1979. The tailings from these mines have inevitably found their way into the rivers and accumulated in the sediment load transported by the river. The subsequent Anthropocene array of human-generated materials evident in river sediments is remarkably diverse, including a range of plastic polymers, metals such as aluminum and titanium, concrete, and novel ceramics, with much of these fashioned into distinctive technofossils such as bottles and bricks. These objects, and fragments of them, will be carried and deposited together with the river sediment, having been sorted by the running water into size and shape and hydrodynamic equivalence. At the microscopic scale, there is now an influx of microplastics, fly ash particles, glass microbeads, and novel chemicals\u2014persistent organic pollutants such as pesticides and dioxins, which are not only dissolved in the water but also cling to sediment particles such as clays. The study of how these objects and compounds travel through, and are successively buried and exhumed in strata of the river system sensu lato\u2014and how a portion of this novel and infinitely varied cornucopia eventually makes its way into the sea\u2014is in its infancy. A vast increase in nitrogen and phosphorous entering the Mississippi River system during the Anthropocene results from the runoff of fertilizers, livestock waste, and soil erosion from the major farming states of the Midwest, and human sewage from large urban population centers. Such nutrient-enrichment causes algal blooms that ultimately deplete the oxygen content of waters, especially those entering the Gulf of Mexico at the Mississippi Delta. This creates a \u201cdead zone\u201d that extends westwards from the delta; the extent varies seasonally and has been recorded as up to 22,700 square kilometers (summer 2017), extending as far west as Texas. The biology (which can also be thought of as future paleontology) of the Mississippi is also changing, as the accompanying essay on \u201cneobiota\u201d (invasive species) makes clear. The future of the Mississippi in the Anthropocene What of the future? As the world warms and the sea level rises from the buildup of greenhouse gases, much of the Mississippi Delta (and most of the other sea-facing deltas in the world) will likely disappear over the next century or two, inundated by the sea. A new delta will begin to form, perhaps somewhere near where Baton Rouge is currently located. Even that, though, will likely step farther backwards upon the North American continent as sea levels continue to rise over centuries and millennia, as the Earth slowly adjusts to its new heat balance. The river, now shortened by losing its seaward portion, will likely adjust in other ways. Quite how its corset of concrete, brick, and steel will develop will depend on how the local population adapts to the trauma and disruption of losing the towns and cities of the delta. All other things being equal, the displaced people will have to move inland and rebuild\u2014and so add to the concrete, brick, and steel that holds the river tight. The abandoned infrastructure of New Orleans and its neighborhoods, meanwhile, will either be degraded and eroded (those parts above the sea surface) or be in the early stages of burial and future fossilization (those parts at and beneath the newly extended shallow sea floor). Other scenarios might be envisaged, though, in which the technosphere does not repair its physical fabric so effectively, if its human components lose or weaken their cooperative function. The upstream Mississippi will warm as the Earth enters its new, hotter climate state. There will be some physical and chemical effects (water that becomes fractionally less viscous, an increase in the rate of chemical weathering), though the most obvious effects will be in an emerging new community of plants and animals that are better adapted to the heat. Here, the array of invasive species may prove crucial, as among the thousands of invaders will be some from hot climates elsewhere in the world, and they will be the ones best placed to take advantage of this new thermal landscape. One might consider this a positive side effect of the Anthropocene (better, perhaps\u2014some kind of local biosphere more functional than the maladapted remnants of a former, cooler climate state). The Mississippi will then be a new river in a new Anthropocene world.",

                "text": "Unintended consequences and slippages in time   The following discussion was held between Ele Carpenter, Ayesha Hameed, Hanna Husberg, and Laura McLean at GV Art London following a screening of \u201cThe Free Sea\u201d in late November 2014. Ele \u2014 So I wonder if we can start with an opening question about how you made your film? I know you started researching this project a long time before you actually went to the Maldives. Could you tell us how your lived experience of going there and being in that place changed your thinking about both the Anthropocene and the specific context of the Maldives? Laura \u2014 One thing that was significant was that the Contingent Movements Archive, of which the film is an outcome, was designed as an Internet-based project from the start. Much of our research had been online, and this was how we gathered information about sea-level rise and the threat to the island\u2019s existence. Although some of this information was produced by Maldivians, much was written by others. What we noticed when we were in the Maldives is that there isn\u2019t that sense of urgency conveyed in these texts. The place has quite a consistent climate, and a relaxed island lifestyle. Because it\u2019s an equatorial country, each day is kind of the same\u2014it\u2019s warm, the sun sets at the same time all year round. Until fairly recently it had a subsistence economy, and people lived much more in the present so there is not a culture of saving up for the winter, of accrual. During our travels we didn\u2019t experience a sense of emergency, which might be related to this. Hanna \u2014 Although we were looking from afar at what was available on the web, we also did meet with Maldivians living in London in our initial research phase. It might also be good to mention that there are very few books by Maldivians, as all books need to be approved by the government, and many have been censored. We met primarily with members of Maldives Research, a London-based NGO, and with students they put us in touch with. Actually Maldivians are very cosmopolitan, which is related partly to the fact that because the first Maldivian university only opened in the last few years, many study abroad. All the students we met were from Mal\u00e9, the capital island. It is this island we zoom in on at the beginning of the film, and as you could see, it is completely covered by urban development. Mal\u00e9 hosts a third of the population of the country and is one of the most densely inhabited islands in the world. Discussing what they thought of the situation in the Maldives, these students told us the main problem in the Maldives was that everything has become politicized. Ele \u2014 Can you explain what that means? Laura \u2014 It\u2019s an emerging democracy\u2014I mean it is a democracy but it\u2019s still finding its feet as one. The communities over there are very polarized politically. We were there in the lead-up to the elections, and in the film you can see the campaign flags and colours that were all over the city, even in the sea and on the smallest of islands. One party was pink, another was yellow, and a third party was red and green. People were very overt about their political convictions, and would hang out and spend time together at the campaign centers. Maldivians have always had a strong identity based on which island and atoll they come from, and traditionally one\u2019s island name is included in one\u2019s own name. People now also strongly identify with the political party they support, to the point where some were even having their family\u2019s graves painted in the colours of their party. Ayesha \u2014 I have another contextualizing question, which will complement Ele\u2019s. Seeing how this project has developed, with a series of events and exhibitions, a website, and then a film which operates kind of as an archive of the project, one thing that is striking about the film is the amount of information. I made a list of concerns which I thought almost functioned as chapters: sea levels, disappearing and recurring islands, the issue of migrant labor, the idea of reclaimed land, residues that are created from limestone artifacts, with a scalar dropping down into the museum objects that get destroyed, and finally this movement to Manus Island and Lampedusa and other ports of migration for people claiming asylum. So my question is: Do those concerns reflect the themes of your initial research? Laura \u2014 It was a broad project, though hinging on certain issues, and you\u2019ve picked up on several of those. At the start of the film there is footage shot on 8mm film of the archipelago between Finland and Sweden, and the film ends as we travel down the Grand Canal in Venice at high water. So it starts and ends in Europe. We were thinking a lot about the European origins of international law, and how responsibility for climate change lies with industrialization originating in the West, while repercussions are often felt elsewhere. So we start with Grotius and his book, Mare Liberum,Hugo Grotius, The Free Freedom of the Seas: Or, The Right Which Belongs to the Dutch to Take Part in the East Indian Trade, tr. Ralph Van Deman Magoffin, 1608. which contributed to the rise of global free trade and the International Law of the Sea, and then come around from the Maldives through islands significant to this narrative, and end with footage from a symposium at UNESCO in Paris, where we held an exhibition within a larger exhibition, \u201cAdapting to the Anthropocene.\u201d\u201cAdapting to the Anthropocene\u201d This was organized as part of the events for World Philosophy Day, and the speakers that you can hear in the film in direct translation are from a conference organized in this context.World Philosophy Day We are interested in the role of the UN now in global governance, and the conference speakers allude to that. So that\u2019s the circular path of ideas through the film. \u2014 The first time this layering happens is when the camera is at the surface of the water, with waves lapping over it and also engulfing the capital island on the horizon. Then the camera goes underwater, discovering the coral bed of the island, and here we juxtapose the coral with footage from the underwater cabinet meeting. Before that we had a slower introduction with 8mm footage of sea and islands, followed by the composite Google Earth imagery of a spinning planet and zooming in on the atolls of the Maldives. We wanted to use the language of images to emphasize the shifts of perspective and also the materiality of a nation made out of water and coral. Some of the elements then come back cyclically to structure the film.  Laura \u2014 Of course we shot a lot of our own footage, but we also pulled a lot of things from online sources. With the Contingent Movements Archive we were thinking about the web as the common cultural pool of everyone who has access to it, and therefore we didn\u2019t hesitate to treat it as a resource. One of the speculative aspects of the project was the idea that a diaspora without a homeland might upload its common culture to create a national archive online, and we considered to what degree this might be an open or closed collection of digital artifacts, and what the conditions of access might be. A project of this scale would be hugely expensive, and for practical and ideological reasons, an open-source archive seemed to offer solutions to the many questions of access, presence, and participation this proposal provokes. Ele \u2014 So to come back to how you use different kinds of film footage, it seems to me to highlight the awareness of staging an event that is viewed from different perspectives at the same time. The signing of the mandate is staged as a very effective media spectacle distributed over global networks, producing a visual articulation around what is otherwise an extremely slow, almost imperceptible process. It speeds up this moment of crisis into an event that is otherwise invisible. Obviously this is a highly networked journalistic spectacle but I wonder how it fits into the vernacular of the Maldives, and what might be a climate-change vernacular or survival vernacular, and how that might emerge historically and slowly over very long periods of time. My other question is about the idea that this is a microcosm of a moment of climate change where the Maldives have a number of different strategies for survival. Let\u2019s say they might end up with two islands: one a platform, built up using sand, and the other a rubbish tip, to store waste. How do you then prioritize those two different spaces in relation to one another? I know Venice has the same structure with a specific rubbish tip island, and it also has the cemetery island. So you can start to compartmentalize different moments of life and death through their geographic isolation. The vernacular of the Maldives is of course very different from that in Venice, so I wondered if you could talk about a kind of local vernacular response to this ebb and flow, the erosion and the growing of islands that is a familiar phenomenon for the Maldivians, and you might say a cultural phenomenon as well as a geological or environmental one? Hanna \u2014 We were naturally intrigued by the questions brought up by a whole country disappearing into the ocean. A more specific starting was, however, a statement made by the former president Mohammed Nasheed, who, in order to prevent his constituents from becoming climate refugees if the worst scenario comes about, proposed to start a national fund to buy land abroad in India, Sri Lanka, or Australia. The first reaction of Laura, who comes from Australia, to this claim was that this wouldn\u2019t be possible politically. So quite early in our research we were interested in the feasibility of that claim. Nasheed is actually very well known, as he\u2019s a prominent activist for environmental issues. At the beginning of the film you see some images of the underwater cabinet meeting that he organized prior to the Copenhagen summit in 2009. He worked as a journalist before becoming president and knows how to get attention. It was really interesting for us to see this very strong figure making these big statements in an extremely mediatized way. Also because this performative approach resonates with strategies and methods used by some artists. Laura \u2014 We visited and interviewed the curators of the National Museum of the Maldives while we were there. This is also where the Buddhist statues were smashed during the political upheaval in 2012. Some of the CCTV footage you can see in the film was taken in the room where objects are categorized and classified. The statues which were kept there were the only ones in the collection to survive as the vandals tried to erase this part of their history. Another object kept in this room is the mandate document signed in the underwater cabinet meeting, so you see it was a highly orchestrated act of self-historicization. Ele \u2014 Can we ask some more formal questions about the film? For example, you use different aspect ratios showing at the same time, such as when you\u2019re showing the signing of the documents underwater, or the smashing of the sculptures. Ayesha \u2014 It\u2019s also like you choose two specific kinds of images, right? So one is this very aerial graphic, and then you have these vernacular images where you get a sense of you both walking in the city capturing images of day-to-day life. So I was wondering, what comes out from the conjuncture of those two gazes? And in what ways does that reflect what your project tries to do? Hanna \u2014 We were working with a lot of very different video material and the way we decided to put everything together also derives from this Internet thinking, which was part of the project from the beginning. So there is a process of layering, and we were also keen to work with the materiality of things. Laura \u2014 Well, when Naseema Mohamed speaks about islands growing and dissolving in the film, it is interesting to note that she is the author of An Etymological Dictionary of Maldivian Island Names. It is a beautiful book that describes how the name of each island is based on its location, behavior, composition, and use. Also, during the symposium, one of our participants, Mariyam Shiuna, described how many of the words used in the Maldives are geographically specific, or based on the behavior of local flora and fauna. The contingencies of the landscape are completely bound up in the way of life there. Previously people lived on fish and coconuts, and everything was biodegradable, so when people threw things on the beach they would dissolve and disappear. This is why the word for the beach is also the same for garbage in Dhivehi (the national language of the Maldives). Things were in flux and they were able to be in flux. But now, because everything is imported into the country, the beaches on domestic islands are covered in plastic and garbage. The older generation is still in the habit of throwing garbage onto the beaches, whereas younger generations understand that this can\u2019t continue. So the nature of flux has changed as the country has adapted to a capitalist economy. Hanna \u2014 Another consequence of this Westernization, and something that might be important to think about for the future of the Maldives, is the lack of sustainable food resources. Until the 1970s, the country used to be self-sufficient except for rice, which was traded with Sri Lanka and India, while virtually everything is imported nowadays. So this has changed over a short period of time. Curiously, there is another small island nation, Kiribati, which took up the idea of the former president to buy land abroad, in their case in Fiji. For the time being they are actually using the land mainly for agriculture to secure the nation\u2019s food resources. This is something that the Maldives might also need to think about. There are currently projects for reclaiming land, such as on Hulhumal\u00e9 Island next to Mal\u00e9. Maldivian NGO Bluepeace has proposed that five to seven artificial islands raised three meters above sea level should be constructed in different regions in order to host the entire population. But these projects are extremely expensive and would need to be planned ahead, something the short-term political thinking in place isn\u2019t promoting. Coconut trees are also amongst the only plants that grow in these conditions, and with an increase of salt water seeping into the supplies of fresh water, even these will not grow. Ayesha \u2014 I\u2019m really interested from a temporal point of view in this idea of the self-conception of the islands disappearing and reappearing historically, that it\u2019s part of the identity of the islands, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s narrated\u2014some come, some go, some emerge from underwater. What does crisis mean in that context? Is it something that already happens within the national memory of the country? What is it that makes it into a crisis? Because in a way this is a very slow process, like anything environmental the timescale is very different. But the way it looks in the short term is very much within the rhythm and imaginary of the life of the islanders. There are a few things that sparked for me, a few ideas; one of them comes from a book that Sandro Mezzadra and Brett Neilson wrote called Border as Method, or, the Multiplication of Labor.Sandro Mezzadra and Brett Neilson, Border as Method, or, the Multiplication of Labor. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2013. There is a chapter on Manus Island in which they talk about this one incident where migrants refused to disembark from the ship and they use this as a kind of stalling tactic. Some of the work I\u2019m doing is seeing that as a kind of temporal border at sea. This prolongation of the migrants who refuse to leave the ship constitutes a temporal refusal, but once you\u2019re on land, if you\u2019re applying for documents, it is a completely labyrinthine, Kafkaesque process, and that too is a temporal border. What struck me with what you\u2019re dealing with is how, specifically for those refugees who are claiming status or asylum based on climate change, that temporality is off the charts. I think the interrelation between shorter time spans and longer time spans, this kind of rhythm between humanly recognizable cycles and events, and what\u2019s happening with the climate, is really foregrounded in this rising and sinking of the islands. That contrast produces arguably a really interesting chronotope of island life just as it produces a really interesting kind of poetics of relations, as Glissant would say.Eduard Glissant, Poetics of Relation, tr. Betsy Wing. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1997. There is a kind of relationship to territoriality that is very slippery because of this slippage in time. Hanna \u2014 I mentioned earlier how densely populated Mal\u00e9 is. A third of the population lives on this small island, and this is due to internal migration that has been going on since the 1970s. With the income from tourism there was some money to invest in infrastructure and as they couldn\u2019t build the infrastructure scattered over hundreds of islands, they started with the capital. This is why so many people moved there and to some other bigger islands. Because of this there is now a generation born on Mal\u00e9 who have a completely different approach to what island life is. Mal\u00e9 is all urban, full of imported cars and motorcycles, and products from all over the world. A lot of the people we met had studied abroad, in Saudi Arabia, London, India, or Kuala Lumpur, and they spoke fluent English, and Hindi from watching Indian television. So there is a young generation, a large percentage of the population, who have a completely different perspective about moving away. They have already moved away from their traditional islands, or their parents have. So there are different groups of people with different relations to territoriality. Of course, it is very different on smaller islands, and there are examples of how difficult the integration between islanders from neighboring islands has been. Laura \u2014 We heard about instances after the tsunami where there was no infrastructure left on some islands, and people had to move to nearby islands. At first, they got along with their hosts, who were happy to receive and welcome them. But after a while, little differences between the communities started to show, and they ended up in conflict with one another. So they had to find another solution. There was another instance we heard of where a bridge had naturally formed between two islands. So for efficiency\u2019s sake they shared infrastructure, but it had to be built on this bridge, as it would have been unfair to build on one side or the other. In Suvendrini Perera\u2019s presentation for the symposium we organized, she talked about how different islands have been circumscribed by British colonization. The continent of Australia, for instance, contains hundreds of Aboriginal nations. Coming from Sri Lanka, too, she spoke of the heterogeneous cultures sharing this island. Ele \u2014 This just raises so many questions about the relationship between the nation-state and cultural identity, and whether you need one to protect or to construct the other. But let\u2019s open up to the floor. Comments from the floor \u2014 In relation to the Copenhagen summit, I remember there were a lot of lawyers representing islands that were threatened by disappearance. There was a big lawsuit; do you know what happened with this? Hanna \u2014 We haven\u2019t been following that specific case, but for the symposium we invited a specialist in the law of the sea, Davor Vidas, who discussed how rising sea levels challenge international law by challenging the idea of stable borders. This is actually forcing international law to reconsider its foundations, which are built upon property rights. Ayesha referred to climate or environmental refugees, but although there are ongoing discussions on how international law should define the rights of people who will have to move because of global warming and rising sea levels, there is currently no legal definition or protection for climate-related displaced people. What Vidas told us is that, instead of defining them as refugees, the committee working on this is aiming to push the issue towards a question of human rights. This would be a move away from the current convention of international law, based on property rights. Ele \u2014 I was just thinking that in northern Fenno-Scandinavia the land is apparently rising as it was compressed by ice sheets during the last glacial period, so there is an uplift taking place, which could reveal a new or expanded territory. So in the balance of available land, maybe there could be a Fennoscandic-Maldivian settlement in the North? But getting back to this temporal thinking, I wanted to ask you how long is 100 years, and what exactly does that mean? Is it the forecast that the islands will have disappeared completely within 100 years? Or that the rising sea levels will cause a critical point for the islands within that time? Or does it mean the next generation or outside our time frame? Laura \u2014 It\u2019s a funny period, because it\u2019s rare to live beyond 100 years, so it\u2019s longer than one\u2019s life, you can anticipate that far, but then you can\u2019t quite, which is kind of the problem. I mean obviously we are all closely watching political developments and decisions that will affect how fast sea levels rise and how hot it will get. I think that we came away in the end thinking that Maldivians are not going to move away\u2014there is technology already being used to build higher islands\u2014so unless politically things fail completely and carbon emissions continue to rise, my feeling is that they will be able to stay there, although they might have to centralize, which is already happening. Hanna \u2014 There are strong interests in keeping the Maldives\u2014the tourist industry is quite powerful\u2014and it\u2019s a small and limited population compared with other affected territories that will have to deal with more difficult conditions. We were, however, interested in the specific scenario and the challenges the possible disappearance of a whole nation-state presents. Ele \u2014 This resonates with the idea of the nation-state as an augmented body, in the way that the UNESCO lecture in your film talks about one of the aesthetics of the Anthropocene as being the augmented human. The Maldives, as a disappearing nation-state, is a concrete example of global climate change and the potential rupture between territory and cultural identity, and how that\u2019s formed, shifts, and changes. And what happens when language becomes dislocated from land, and that\u2019s a huge rupture, isn\u2019t it? Comment from the floor \u2014 I was interested in this idea of how long is a hundred years, and I\u2019m back to this idea of creating a spectacle for a slow process. It seems to me that for us the Maldives is almost an image of the future, of our future, of people who don\u2019t live in the Maldives. So potentially the Maldives is an image of a future that is maybe closer for us than for them. Laura \u2014 That\u2019s interesting. I think the image that most people have of the Maldives is as a kind of utopian elsewhere where you go on holiday. Facing it as a future scenario plays into that as well. It\u2019s this dystopian future in this faraway place, which can be our future. Ayesha \u2014 Well, it\u2019s a cautionary tale, right? Anytime the Maldives comes up now it is around this discourse\u2014it is the first casualty of the rising sea levels. That\u2019s the test case set of islands. It is inextricable from that as an image. Ele \u2014 A hundred years is about the same time our low-level nuclear waste is forecast to roll into the sea around Britain. Within 100 years, rising sea levels will cause no end of catastrophes. The 100 years is the next generation\u2014it\u2019s foreseeable, it\u2019s knowable, it\u2019s not quite preventable, but it\u2019s manageable. The technologies that we have now can be developed to manage the problems we have now, and then there is this kind of future forecasting beyond the 100 years of what technologies we might have, of speculative survival techniques. A hundred years is outside our political structures\u2014to be honest, more than four years is outside our political structures. I spent some time in Japan and in Fukushima this summer, and one of the interesting discussions that I was hosting as part of a symposium was about how politicians within Fukushima prefecture don\u2019t want to deal with radioactivity and radioactive contamination, because if they evacuate their constituency they won\u2019t have a political constituency to vote them in. So there\u2019s self-interest in keeping your electorate together. This is the epitome of the nation-state in a bureaucratic sense and if you think about politics as a power structure. So what happens when it becomes preferential to disperse your electorate in some way, and how do you take your power with you? There are other examples in the Fukushima prefecture where council offices have been relocated into lower radiation zones, so they still have the infrastructure to manage the decontamination of the area, and to manage their now dispersed town that doesn\u2019t live there any more. There are interesting parallels there about what it might mean to have a group identity and what the political role is if you think about a constituency literally being a constituency or electorate. Ayesha \u2014 A few things in what you\u2019ve been saying bring up Glissant again\u2014in a sense, this idea of displaced people as opposed to people who have a \u201cconnection\u201d to the land. Glissant creates a dichotomy between the two and says that this relationship to territory, this kind of mythic, spiritual connectedness, this idea of having an intrinsic relationship, comes from the side of power. That it\u2019s a story that we tell from the point of view of acquiring more land, that there is a connectedness. But on the flipside he talks about a deterritorialized relationship to land, which is not just utopic. His first example is of settlers who land on a territory, who essentially kill the people who are there. So as settlers their relation to that land is inherently rhizomatic, it\u2019s not connected. But that same logic is at the same time applicable to people who are served from below, people who migrate, people who have to land on their feet. So it seems like this dichotomy you\u2019re talking about from the side of governmental powers, to keep a kind of mythical relationship to a prefecture or to a body of land. Even if they are physically displaced, there is this idea of naming this constituency over here, but the reality is what you\u2019re talking about, like the infrastructure on the bridge between two islands, sort of provisional or what de Certeau would call tactical relations.Michel de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life, tr. Steven Rendall. Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1984. If you conceive of your connection to the land as one based on contingency and relationality, that\u2019s much closer to the lived reality around how fragile our connection is.",

However, what defines this extended system is not so much the cities and metropolitan regions\u2014the agglomeration zones of \u201cconcentrated urbanization\u201d\u2014but rather the broader and historically pervasive operationalization of natural systems: an assemblage of \u201coperational landscapes,\u201d where nature is put to work.

Out of the almost 1 million km2 of farmland covering the basin, more than 60% is dedicated to a rotation between corn and soybeans, mostly concentrated along the upper Mississippi Basin, with around 100 million tons of the resultant crops exported. If the agricultural productivity of the landscape is the foremost process of operationalization across the basin, the second is the circulation of mostly dry-bulk, primary commodities, including, but not limited to, agricultural products. The map in figure 3 reflects the general distribution of flows of freight traffic across the US, both road traffic (trucks) and waterborne traffic. The historical importance of the Mississippi network of waterways is still prevalent as waterborne freight transport remains by far the most cost-effective option, especially when transporting bulky commodities (with low value to weight ratios), which characterize the productive output of the region (agricultural products, chemicals, fuels, minerals). Almost 4% of all annual US freight volume is transported through the upper and lower Mississippi River waterways, a system that also has stitched along it a series of intermodal ports bringing together barge, truck, and rail traffic.",

But as processes of operationalization intensify in the constant search of profit, the capacities of natural systems to support them are gradually exhausted and need to be compensated through recurring investment and eventual capital intensification: fertilizer inputs substitute the lost fertility of the soil, while constant drainage is required to sustain navigational depth across the waterways. At the same time, efforts to expand this capacity often lead to further degradation. The increased used of herbicides and genetically modified crops leads to the evolution of more resistant \u201csuperweeds\u201d and \u201csuperbugs,\u201d while drainage efforts through tilling lead to increased water pollution, erosion, and sedimentation\u2014all of which require further investment in infrastructure and inputs, in a constant struggle to maintain the operationality of the landscape. A vicious cycle of increasing investment, commodification, and intensification, only to sustain thinning profit margins, lays bare the limits of operationalization, as its consecutive waves exhaust the \u201cecological surplus\u201d of the Mississippi Basin. As the underlying logic of operationalization is driven by the search for profit, the hyper-productivity of the region yields questionable results. The metabolism of the agroindustrial system offers a lucid example: While agricultural yields continue to rise, the region is barely producing any food. More than 50% of the corn and soy production ends up as animal feed, with its nutritional contribution deteriorating as it flows through the meat processing industry. What is even more striking is that a growing amount of crops is not even part of the food/feed nexus, but are rather inputs for the biofuel industry. In fact, to a large extent, the Mississippi Basin is turning into an energy landscape, characterized by a quite paradoxical metabolism: as large quantities of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers need to be diffused over the Cornbelt to compensate for the exhausted fertility of the soil, tons of fertilizers are shipped through the Mississippi transport network, from the fertilizer processing and mixing plants that are stitched along it, and which are interwoven with the pipelines providing their main input: natural gas. In this rather absurd cycle, one form of energy (natural gas), is eventually turned into another (biofuel), having been transmitted through nitrogen fertilizers and plants. Moreover, excess nitrogen is \u201creturned\u201d to the riverine system in the form of water pollution, reflected in figure 4. This map overlays nitrogen deposition along the watersheds with the location of natural gas pipelines and fertilizer plants, disclosing this irrational interplay that is facilitated through subsides and regulatory frameworks aiming to address agricultural surpluses and trade crises.",

This strip divides the whole site from the surrounding area before the horizon shifts into the prefabricated slabs of GDR mass housing. In the well-established \u201cDong Xuan Center,\u201d several workshops found their home, now comprising the \u201clargest Asian market in Berlin.\u201d Close by, the building still owned by \u201cPantrac,\u201d the company that bought the site from Treuhand after the reunification of Germany, produces carbon and graphite objects as it has done since 1997. The main VEB factory buildings were demolished, but the two giant concrete towers that remain were preserved simply because it was too expensive to dismantle them. All the steel components of the former factory, however, were sold to China. The soil on the site is highly contaminated; therefore, the whole surface has been paved over with concrete. In some areas, the concrete seems to be unstable. Soil pollution apparently has not affected the local perception of the danger the contamination may pose, and economic activities continue to flourish. The entire area around the two concrete towers is currently owned by a Pakistani entrepreneur who established part of his business empire alongside a Tandoori restaurant on the site. Although his permit only covers the running of the restaurant, he runs it as a canteen to serve all the on-site workshops. The loose regulatory framework regarding land exploitation is due to the German political transition in the 1990s, which created the preconditions for the present lack of clarity with respect to the legal situation of the many businesses on the site.",

Some of the soil removed for the realization of the reservoir was used to construct a small hill on which grass seed has been grown; the vision is to one day have goats grazing on it. The remaining soil became the basis of a huge platform of around 60 cm high. This giant sarcophagus, the size of a tennis court, finally furnished with a number of street lamps, may become an ice-skating rink in the future. During several visits to the Lichtenberg site prior to the Campus 2014, we explored the definitions of places and spaces that the people working in, living in, and using the space for diverse activities currently use. Naming a spot of land is a well recognized human trait that frequently refers to people\u2019s perception of its actuality, what it is destined to become, or the owner. In the case of the Lichtenberg site, the names people know it by indicate an element of wishful thinking, or define a would-be hypothesis that surely cannot be understood in a literal sense. In particular, considering the highly polluted, ugly, rather than inviting nature of the site\u2019s features, the (nick)names attributed to places on it represent a project, and express an idea of development and change. People speak of a possible future for the place in clearer and shorter words than a detailed map. Both the \u201cswimming pool\u201d and the \u201cice-skating rink\u201d refer to leisure and entertainment, although a somewhat standardized conception. The \u201chill\u201d and the idea that one day goats might be left free to graze on it, as a way of nurturing it, speak to people\u2019s desire to \u201cgo green,\u201d a means of inscribing value into a heavily exploited area of land where clearly grass has near zero value.",

The Vietnamese workers who were selected for special training programs among the local elites in East Germany did not plan to emigrate permanently to Europe, and they expected to return to Vietnam after the five-year training concluded. No project or program was dedicated to integrate the community in East Germany; almost no one learnt German, and, generally, contact with German society was confined to a minimum. A completely different situation can be observed with the South Vietnamese community that emigrated to West Germany. Opponents of the Vietnamese socialist regime escaped from the country without any real hope of ever returning, and special facilitating programs established to promote integration were largely successful. The detailed study of these processes goes beyond the scope of the current case study, but, in outline, the relevant data suggests that to this day the split in the Vietnamese community in Germany is apparent, reflecting the different emigration processes, reasons for emigrating, and political views\u2014in Vietnam as well as in Berlin. In East Berlin, the Vietnamese workers were mainly employed at VEB Elektrokohle. After the factory closed, however, only a small number accepted some financial support to return to Vietnam. The majority remained in Germany illegally, experiencing several phases of isolation and economic crisis. These factors in all likelihood resulted in their determination both to provide a livelihood and to meet all primary local needs within the same community. This large migrant community, which on the one hand has a longstanding presence in Berlin, and on the other hand lives quite separated from the rest of society, is a base for the emergence of a sort of \u201cenclave system\u201d with a robust economic and cultural autonomy.",

Today, there are about 8,000 inhabitants of Vietnamese descent, who constitute the physically isolated and intensely clustered suburban community. In the 1950s, Eastern New Orleans was mostly rural except for services along Chef Menteur Highway. The intercoastal I-10 was built through New Orleans between 1963 and 1972. In the early 1970s, the area was aggressively developed and swampland was drained to make way for suburban habitation. The drainage system, which was put in place before development began, was designed in such a way that it could store heavy rainfall runoff better than in New Orleans and its western counterpart, where similar development had started around ten years earlier. In 1965, Hurricane Betsy caused severe wind damage and flooding in and around Eastern New Orleans. The Flood Control Act of 1965, when ratified, put the federal government in charge of storm protection. With the newly constructed I-10, the envisioned and implemented flood protection, the Industrial Canal, the NASA Michoud plant, and new subdivisions, the \u201cNew Orleans East\u201d development scheme profited greatly from increasing real-estate values throughout the oil-boom years. The intercoastal I-10 helped convert an area previously considered unfit for habitation into a vast suburbia. The common ground between New Orleans and Vietnam is not only their environmental semblance in terms of a semitropical climate and fishing opportunities. Less obvious is that they both share a strong Roman Catholicism, in both cases introduced by the French. Although prosecuted by the government, Catholicism thrived in Buddhist Vietnam. Following the communist victory over the French in the First Indochina War (1946\u201254), Vietnam was partitioned into two states: North and South. North Vietnam was under the rule of Ho Chi Minh and became increasingly hostile territory for Catholics. This resulted in an exodus of Catholics from North to South Vietnam over the following years. The refugees settled in the Mekong Delta and in and around Saigon. They established self-contained hamlets protected against the communists by palisades and with statues of the Virgin Mary and Vatican flags to reconstruct a sense of the past. The end of the Vietnamese War and the fall of Saigon in 1975 led to the reunification of Vietnam under socialist rule and to the second exodus of Catholic Vietnamese, from both rural and urban areas. The United States military supported and brought refugees to four US military bases, in California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Arkansas.",

Of the criteria, New Orleans could not fulfill more than a semitropical climate, but it offered advocacy by a strong relief agency that practiced the same conservative, Vatican-reverent Catholicism as the Vietnamese. The Associated Catholic Charities invited Vietnamese families from a US base in Florida to settle in New Orleans. They sponsored apartments in the \u201cVersailles Arms\u201d\u2014an apartment complex on the periphery of the city\u2014that happened to be available despite a housing shortage and due to layoffs at the Michoud NASA facility nearby. The \u201cfirst wave\u201d of about 3,000 Catholic Vietnamese immigrants arrived in Eastern New Orleans between 1975 and 1977. They were mostly middle-class anti-communist political refugees, so-called \u201celites.\u201d The \u201csecond wave\u201d of refugees or \u201cboat people,\u201d most of them poor rural farmers and fishermen, who had left Vietnam by boat, arrived after 1977 and throughout the early 1980s. A further wave of immigrants in the 1980s and 1990s may have chosen the site perhaps due to its physical appearance, but had there not been an established Vietnamese community already, they might never have arrived there. The refugees commenced gardening shortly after their arrival in 1975. Lawns, front-, side-, and backyards as well as the banks of the Michoud Bayou are cultivated with tiny to elaborate poly-cultural market gardens, creating an agrarian landscape that is reminiscent of their former setting. If it had not been a suburban area, the tradition of gardening may never have occurred. Some of the gardening within the Versailles Arms complex was disapproved and had to be relocated outside the area protected by the levee, where forest was cleared for agricultural land (according to Richard Campanella, the last example of land-use transformation from forest to agriculture on East Bank New Orleans).See Richard Campanella,\u00a0Geographies of New Orleans: Urban fabrics before the storm.

By framing the narrative account of our own culture in the nonhuman context of geological deep time we are subsumed: just another fleeting time-being within the expanse of nature\u2019s exceeding history. Historian Dipesh Chakrabarty has reflected on this in terms of imagining an Earth\u2019s future in which humans are absent, claiming it is a thought experiment in which \u201cour usual historical practices for visualizing times, past and future, times inaccessible to us personally\u2014the exercise of historical understanding\u2014are thrown into a deep contradiction and confusion.\u201dDipesh Chakrabarty, \u201cThe climate of history: Four theses,\u201d Critical Inquiry 35, no. 2 (2009): 197-222. However, framing ourselves within the geological past raises its own conceptual and existential questions. This is not only by virtue of that past\u2019s vast and inhuman scales, but also for the sobering tale it tells about the fate that befalls so many species confronted with abrupt environmental change. In that light, starting this paragraph with \u201cat the same time\u201d shifts from an incidental phrasing into the core question that the Anthropocene designation poses: Can the time of \u201cnature\u201d and the time of \u201cculture\u201d now be embraced as one in the same time? How will the meaningful merging of natural history and human history be negotiated for modern/postmodern/contemporary global societies that have insistently kept nature and culture separate in their economic and philosophic imaginaries?

An Anthropocene River \u00b7 HowDoesTheWorldEndForOthers GeisslerKirkbrideSann   A recording made during Brian Kirkbride, Beate Geissler and Oliver Sann\u2019s performance piece \u201cHow Does the World End (For Others?)\u201d at Fort Defiance Park, October 2019. The author encourages hitting play before reading. In January 2017, Brian Holmes and myself\u2014both in various states of shell-shock from the then recent US election\u2014drove south from Chicago to Carbondale, Illinois to investigate Anthropocene modes of production and the impact they were having on the Cache River Valley.\u00a0 We found coal mining operations emitting heavy swirling dust, streams toxically glowing brown, and community colleges surrounded by coal waste. We found spectacular rock formations and breathtaking views. We found engaged activists, underfunded educational institutions, struggling\u00a0 towns, flooded riverbanks, the birthplace of superman, big trucks and large dams. During that journey we also walked through the remarkable cypress forests at Heron Pond, which provided a stark contrast to the dusty, toxic open pit mines, and systematized farmland we otherwise found surrounding us. What can be learned from this landscape? And what tools are needed for greater understanding? With this question in mind, returning to same region in 2019, I asked Brian about the importance of the Heron Pond area, as a living archive of a landscape before human intervention\u2014is this site also an example of environmental mitigation and adaptation? \u201cWell, not just Heron Pond but the entire Cache River Valley is a kind of living archive,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s one of only a few extant swamps in our part of the country\u2014Illinois or, really, the whole Upper Midwest\u2014where almost every other significant stretch of formerly wet land has been drained, dried up and closed off from the seasonal pulse of rising and falling river waters. So in this unique place you can wander through a beautiful cypress-tupelo environment, the northernmost of its kind, nestled in an ancient bed of the Ohio River. Here you might feel like you\u2019re in Louisiana, looking out through the midday shadows over the intensely green skin of the water, with your imagination tickled by the sight of those knobby, bark-covered growths pushing up beyond the surface, the so-called cypress knees. You might even feel like you\u2019re in a magical place, one that gives an immediate sensation to that odd phrase people sometimes use, \u2018time out of mind.\u2019 But it\u2019s hardly an example of a landscape before human intervention.\u201d As he went on to explain, the drainage process of the Cache River Valley began during the 1910s. Much of the area was logged for the valuable hardwoods and then a simple ditch was dug, to stop the flooding of nearby fields. \u201cThat shallow ditch eroded a little more with each storm, to the point where it\u2019s now sixty feet deep and two hundred feet wide when it finally pours into the Ohio. The little culvert has become a deep canyon that acts like a vacuum-powered suction tube relentlessly pulling the water, the soil, and the trees themselves down an artificial stream, which becomes a raging torrent during spring melt.\u201d If it weren\u2019t for deliberately engineered human intervention, the banks of Heron Pond and the bird and animal habitats it hosts would, in Brian\u2019s words, \u201cjust swirl down into the Ohio River. And at long last, local landowners could plant more soybeans. You know, drain the swamp! It\u2019s an American dream.\u201d",

While experiencing the forest back in 2017, we contemplated bringing others to the region for an immersive experience, to experience such a dynamic landscape that exemplifies so much of what we had been discussing with our Deep Time Chicago collective back in Chicago. Two years later our idea was realized as part of a three-day engagement focusing on political ecology in the Anthropocene, Field Station 4: Confluence Ecologies. As Brian surmised during our recent conversation, \u201cplaces like Heron Pond or the Little Black Slough take us out of the infinite chatter of our minds and yet, at the same time, they make us mindful of the present. At our Field Station 4 we wanted people to experience a world apart, of which we are nonetheless a part. Is there a Louisiana cypress swamp in Illinois? How did it get there, how does it remain there? Is an \u2018invasive\u2019 Asian carp part of a Midwest river? Can you eat it? Can your animal mouth help heal the floodplain you\u2019ve invaded with your levees and ditches and fields and farmed fish? Or we can put all that Anthropocene chatter in aesthetic and philosophical terms: What does a threat look like in a place that\u2019s all beauty? What does beauty look like in a place that\u2019s all threat?\u201d Or, to put it another way: \u201cIt comes down to one of the simplest things anyone can offer anyone else,\u201d he added, \u201ca friendly invitation: would you like to take a stroll beside a swamp on a Sunday afternoon? Where should we be strolling on Sunday Afternoons? This simple question is a large part of the work Deep Time Chicago has been involved in since the 2016 Anthropocene Campus in Berlin. With the support of the Goethe Institute in Chicago, DTC created a series of public walks throughout the Chicagoland area to create a \u201cpublic research trajectory.\u201d Throughout the past three years, we\u2019ve helped lead groups to a wide array of locations including oil refineries, arboretums, cemeteries, buried nuclear reactors, and restored prairies. On this particular Sunday afternoon after engaging with the warm matte green ambiance of the cypress forest while learning about the history and ecosystem at\u00a0 the site we headed towards Cairo, Illinois for the final events of Field Station 4. As dusk descended, and with exhaustion setting in for everyone after days of non-stop programming and socialization, a group of around 30 participants descended on Fort Defiance Park at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. This site of a once thriving but now struggling town has a layered and troubled history and the site of the park where the two major tributaries collide created an aura we hoped to communally explore. Deep Time Chicago members Beate Geissler, Oliver Sann and Brian Kirkbridge had planned\u00a0 a performance to take place on an observation tower in the park while myself and Jenny Kendler launched our floating sculpture, Lounging Through the Flood at the confluence. Shortly before the event the performer\u2014a local Cairo resident\u2014who was booked to sing fell ill and Kayla Anderson (also from DTC) stepped in to fill the role.",

                "text": "I asked Brian Kirkbride how the piece originated. He explained that \u201cBeate &amp; Oliver came to me with the idea to use Hermann Broch\u2019s The Death of Virgil as a reflection on death\u2014 to invite death to the living. Within the context of Cairo, the flood there and the \u201cdevastating situation the world is in,\u201d they felt we should hold a Totentanz: a danse macabre acknowledging where we find ourselves.\u201d Brian had originally imagined accompanying the reading with Franz Liszt\u2019s piano and orchestra work Totentanz, transformed into waves of metal. \u201cBut the more I thought about the weight of classicism, the more I wanted to contrast Virgil with a different voice. I\u2019ve always admired the near crystalline structure of the lyrics to The Knife\u2019s We Share Our Mother\u2019s Health. It\u2019s such a deeply evocative but deceptively simple song\u2014and what&#8217;s a more fitting contrast to classicism than a pop song penned by a feminist, environmentalist, socialist band? That they are Swedish felt relevant considering Greta Thunberg\u2019s recent speech at the UN.\u201d Brian decided he would create a cover of the song, but not present it in a straightforward way: \u201cOliver and Beate restructured the Broch text such that it had a refrain or chorus. The music would creep in underneath the reading so slowly as to be hardly noticed. Oliver had the idea to mix in the sound of insects\u2014which I loved because if nothing else survives our species\u2019 onslaught on the planet, insects probably will.\u201d The music began as a group of us formed a procession carrying the large sculpture down to the water about fifty yards from the observation tower. Quickly after the sculpture launched Kayla began singing and the crowd moved back towards the platform. Ten or so minutes into the performance, the intangible factors of the site and technology seemed to condense the poignancy of the weekend into just a few minutes, as the power went out leaving only Kayla\u2019s unamplified voice to carry on. The audience, somewhat clumsily dazed, began inching closer and closer until everyone converged into a tight constellation, creating the most intimate experience of the weekend and an endpoint which would require no encore. Reflecting on the events of Field Station 4, and the region that we were investigating, it seems appropriate to end with one last exchange between myself and Brian Holmes. An ongoing conversation after these sorts of endeavors always goes something along the lines of \u201cso how do we use this experience to create meaningful change?\u201d I don\u2019t have a definitive answer myself, but looking back at the history of Heron Pond certainly offers some clues. When I asked Brian how activists were involved in the preservation of this area, he told me about the local people who, during the 1970s and early 1980s had realized the land was likely to soon become an instrument of \u201can abstract thing called \u2018the economy\u2019\u201d reach out.\u00a0 First to each other, locally, then naturalist, biologists and ecologists, and even (in his words) \u201cthose weird and scary two-footed critters known as environmentalists, who had connections to big pools of money like the Nature Conservancy, or to unpredictable and frightening entities like the IDNR (Illinois Department of Natural Resources).\u201d As he explained, \u201cpeople in the countryside don\u2019t necessarily like to invite such folks into their living rooms, because it\u2019s never exactly certain what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d The story has an interesting plot twist by the name of the Main Brothers, who owned the sawmill in a nearby town with the unlikely name of Karnak. When push came to shove, the Main Brothers chose to sell their land to the Nature Conservancy, who later transferred it to the IDNR with the contractual understanding that it would become part of a larger preserved area. \u201cWho would have thought? Time out of mind. It turned out that the loggers, too\u2014they loved the land. They wanted to log it, but they didn\u2019t want to drain it. They didn\u2019t want to sell it to the richest local people, those who once grew cotton and now grow soybeans. The loggers had ruined the place, but now it was time to save it. Well, we went to Heron Pond together, right? And it was worth saving, right? And we Americans have just about ruined this planet, with a little help from our old relatives the Europeans, is that right? Can we still look up at the night sky? Do the frogs still croak in the swamps? Do the stars still twinkle? Do you think we can wake up from this dream?\u201d",

                "text": "What about the deep time of Earth history? What does it hold, in terms of revolutions similar to the one we are facing now? What maps, diagrams, imagery did the deep past produce and how does it resurface in the Anthropocene? Can we imagine that the Anthropocene will cease? What is this exit like? Has anybody imag(in)ed what the return to a non-Anthropocene state would be? The temporal designation of the Anthropocene sits solidly on a perpetually expanding threshold subject to disciplinary, cultural, and personal persuasions. As the shape of time itself (points, lines, spirals, circles, waves, spheres) can be considered a cultural construct, we assumed time\u2019s conceptual flexibility as a basic element of our investigation. In order to then take some measure of time and visually proclaim \u201cThis not that is the Anthropocene!\u201d we worked not only to conceive of ways to distinguish certain bits of time from others, but to communicate across spatiotemporal frameworks. Thus, the particular media of delivery became every bit as important as the content of the message. From this new frame of reference, the question became: From goo as amorphous as time, through media as diverse as human experience, is there a way of actively constructing images that could reflexively communicate through deep expanses of time? The seminar investigation, although it touched on many more subjects, focused primarily on three potential products: fossils, hands, and holograms. Fossils  If deep-time communication is the goal, fossils are obvious tools. Intentional fossils could be stratigraphic love notes, buried in a place for some future human(?) to find. If we were to fossilize one specific object to mark this exact moment, what would it be? Should it be a symbolic object newly created for the occasion, or an extant monument\u2014something we would miss? Although certain technological objects embody significant cultural shifts in the patterns of everyday life (i.e. Oldowan handaxe, car, smartphone), we have no inherent mechanism for conveying the objects\u2019 meaning on geological timescales; it dwarfs our faculties for foresight. Considering our role as the active authors of the story, a defining image of today\u2019s Anthropocene would resituate our entire species as animals with a capacity for deep-time communication. Using the fossil as a participatory medium, we can begin to exercise and develop that capacity. A DIY guide to fossilization would allow the independent and continuous preservation of \u201cnew\u201d objects, actually crowdsourcing the intentional population of layers of Earth with meaningful materials as markers of our growth. We make technological evolution itself a living record, and encourage temporal literacy; there is joy in the technofossil!  Holograms A hologram is a dynamic system made static. The hologram simultaneously employs multiple points of view to activate a single entity\u2014be it an object, an image, or an idea. In order to engage explicitly multiplicity as inherent to the human condition, the idea of a holographic reality was central to our investigations. Collective cosmologies, fictions, stories, and imaginaries have validity, not only within the culture that creates them, but also in how one\u2019s perspectives relate to those of others. From this assumption, we attempted to engage \u201cImaging the Anthropocene\u201d by assembling conflicting projections of our universe into a single, holographic map. By overlaying distinct ideas of reality in one space\u2014imagine braiding strands of scientific theories, holy books, and spiritual rites together\u2014points of view converge to form a unified image of a collective humanity. The hypothetical \u201cimage\u201d is compelling as a goal, considering the complementary roles of spiritualities, technological evolution, and storytelling in our relationship[s] to the world around us. Since human experience is constantly evolving, new \u201clayers\u201d are being generated constantly and thus the map will never be complete. But in the end, a holographic map of the universe may be a more beautiful image if left in the mind. After all, as we are in the midst of acknowledging our role in the transformation of the Earth, the designation of the Anthropocene either is super-optimistic, supposing that we last long enough to define an epoch, or heartbreakingly negative. WHEN ARE WE? T-SHIRT As we moved deeper and deeper into the fraught territories of universal humanity, we decided to ask a question because an answer seemed impossible. \u201cWhen are we?\u201d is a provocation. The question evokes an atmosphere of temporal confusion, as if being introduced to the Anthropocene is akin to crash-landing in a foreign time. It is a slogan conceived as a tool to allow atomized conversations to supersede our small group and engage multiple publics. By making it wearable, we make the wearer a docent and allow each individual who reads it to engage, subsequently reflecting and developing a unique position. If we are declaring a new period in Earth\u2019s history, we must ask the essential question: \u201cWhen are we?\u201d",

These conditions, acting alongside institutional weaknesses and government failures, constitute the key drivers of vulnerability and insurgency in the region. Conditions in Lake Chad provide a dynamic test bed of broad relevance for understanding mainstream human\u2012environment linkages, particularly in relation to the subjects of sustainability and resilience in the Anthropocene. Sustainability in this sense encompasses the need to recharge the lake and restore it to a level where it can continue to sustain local livelihoods and regional economies. Where this is not possible, then proactively upgrading the resilience of the locals will be necessary. This can be realized by enhancing the capacity of lakeside communities to create alternative livelihood options and to seek strategies that would increase their competence to confront emerging threats associated with the degradation of Lake Chad.",

This 5.2-mile Canal with its historic lock and bridge complex was completed in 1923 and for the first time, artificially connected Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River. The Industrial Canal expansion is expected to last 15-years and cost over a billion dollars by Corps estimates.

This project will likely significantly impact the health and well-being of area residents and disrupt, if not destroy, the economic development of the surrounding neighborhoods. It will likely snarl commuting between Orleans and St. Bernard Parishes and could impact essential hurricane evacuation routes.

While New Orleans is confronting this project in 2020, Congress originally authorized a replacement lock for the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (IHNC) in 1956. Since then, the project has been delayed by neighborhood grass root opposition, environmental lawsuits, Hurricane Katrina, and the Corps of Engineers own vacillating and incomplete designs. The 1956 Congressional authorization included funding for the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO): a laser straight, forty-foot deep artificial channel dug through the mud of the marsh and designed to speed mari-time between the Gulf of Mexico and the Port of New Orleans. The 1956 Congressional authorization also required a fifty percent local fiduciary partner to match federal funds for improvements to the IHNC and the digging of MRGO. At that time, this local partner was the Port of New Orleans. The context of the proposed IHNC lock expansion project must be viewed through the lenses of a community and region that coexist with water. The history of projects to control this water for economic gain are littered with side effects that have been disastrous to the landmass of Southeastern Louisiana and the people who live there. The original vision of the Port of New Orleans was to somehow do what nature had never done: connect Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River by digging a canal and building navigational lock to mitigate the differences in water levels. The Industrial Canal and Lock complex were completed in 1923 with the intent of concentrating barge and ocean-going traffic in this more predictable tidal zone rather than on the unpredictable riverfront. In 1927, not long after the completion of the canal and lock, heavy spring rains and snowmelt from the North raised the Mississippi River to unprecedented levels. This was perceived as a threat to New Orleans bankers and Port officials who feared the new lock would be overtopped by water. Port and City officials agreed to breach the Mississippi River levee below New Orleans in order to save the City. As a result, St. Bernard Parish was flooded and thousands of people were hurt and left homeless. The region\u2019s fishing and fur-trapping economy were devastated. There was no form of compensation given to Parish residents. It is well understood that there was very little chance of New Orleans actually flooding in 1927 and this levee breach was done to show the rest of the nation that New Orleans could control its river. As the Port of New Orleans grew to one of the largest in the United States, there were two deficiencies seen as impeding economic expansion. The IHNC lock was allegedly becoming a bottleneck in the system because of its inadequate size. In addition, the meandering ninety-mile journey between New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico took a lot of time (and fuel). The 75-mile MRGO was completed in 1965 and coincided with Hurricane Betsy. During that massive storm, extensive areas of St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans were flooded like never before.\u00a0 To area residents, something had fundamentally changed: the storm surge historically buffered by wetlands, was now in their homes and had a clear connection to the existence of MRGO. At the same time, the Eastern side of the IHNC flood wall failed allowing the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain to enter the Lower Ninth Ward: a black working-class neighborhood. There was massive flooding, loss of life, and devastating property damage in this neighborhood that also had the highest percentage of owner occupied housing in the city. A significantly more horrible version of this same story was repeated in 2005 with Hurricane Katrina. The people who were encouraged to settle along the IHNC bore the brunt of these bad water management decisions. The Desire and Florida Avenue housing projects were built on the Western side of the IHNC to provide residences for the labor force anticipated by the Port to staff their activity on the Canal. In reality, cargo handling became more mechanized during the 1960s and these jobs never materialized. The people who occupied these housing developments were marginalized and isolated from the rest of the City. Poorly constructed and in low lying areas, the Florida and Desire developments fell rapidly into disrepair and were all but abandoned after Hurricane Katrina flooded them.",

                "text": "In 1986, the Port sold its IHNC land and navigational lock to the Corp who intended to replace the historic lock with a new deep-draft version to service MRGO interests. While continuing to support the lock expansion, the Port saw problems with the tidewater system that the Port found troubling. The MRGO channel proved to be problematic and was underutilized and sometimes impassable because of collapsing earthen sides that were constantly eroded by ship wakes. The Corps spent a lot of time and money dredging the channel to keep the required depth of forty feet. The erosion significantly widened the channel over the years to over a quarter mile in some places. The Port was sensitive to the growing political fallout connected to MRGO environmental impacts as well the proposed expansion of the IHNC lock complex and its effects on the adjacent and neighborhoods. After Katrina, the Port removed their massive gantry cranes from the IHNC and moved back to the Riverfront. While still having barge industry ties in the IHNC, the Port of New Orleans is no longer a fiduciary partner and will invest no money in the Corps plan to expand the lock complex. So, why now spend billions of dollars and thirteen years building a new lock into this residential neighborhood? A very good question with its answer\u2019s roots in the Corps ownership of this land and its habit of putting the political influence of national energy and shipping interests above those of our citizens. For decades, the Corps of Engineers has been transforming the waterways and rivers of the nation for their clients: the barge and shipping industries. The Corps&#8217; myopic view of water management projects seems blind to modern environmental science and the secondary and tertiary effects caused by its actions. The proposal to build a new lock in the Industrial Canal is a clear demonstration of the make-work mentality and unchecked entitlement that have contributed to the failure of the grand plan of the Industrial Canal. It should be understood that the COE is emboldened to act in such a way as it possesses \u201csovereign immunity\u201d from accountability; the Corps is functionally above the law. As a branch of the military, the decision-making processes for these projects occurs largely out of public view. Of equal importance is the fact that this project does nothing to undo the years of poor water management decisions left behind by government and industry. This project squanders money that could otherwise be spent improving New Orleans flood defenses. Instead, building a new lock directs limited funding resources towards the needs of the navigation industry while ignoring the greater needs of the region, the City, and its residents.

The plan is to construct a new lock at Galvez Street, situated to the north of the Claiborne Bridge in the above image, so that fewer historic properties will have to be demolished. The original plan was to take three blocks of the Holy Cross-National Register Historic District, just southeast of the bridge, and construct a new lock adjacent to the existing one. This plan was eventually withdrawn by the COE due to community concerns: environmental impact issues and the loss of a significant number of historic buildings in the Holy Cross Historic district. The proposed Galvez Street location for the new lock will have the effect of bringing the Mississippi River water elevations 12 blocks further into the City; the River&#8217;s current water levels end at the St. Claude bridge. Twenty-four-foot-tall \u201cT\u201d walls will be erected from the River to that Galvez Street location. These walls will require over three years of pile driving adjacent to the Lower Bywater, Lower Ninth Ward and Holy Cross Neighborhoods; walls of similar design have failed and flooded these neighborhoods in the past In order to create a chamber for the new lock, the Corps will excavate highly toxic sediment from the bottom of the Industrial Canal. There is no final solution for the destination of these excavations, but current planning scenarios have them loaded onto barges and then offloaded onto temporary sites in Orleans Parish until they can find a final resting place. One plan floated by the Corps is to use this material in the marshes to build wetlands. The documented presence of industrial wastes in these sediments do not meet federal regulations for this purpose and the Corps would be required to obtain a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency to do this. All of this activity exposes the residents Orleans and St. Bernard Parishes to both air and water-borne toxins that will proliferate during more than a decade of proposed construction.\u00a0 No current environmental impact studies have been conducted to assess the effects of this project on area residents. Once the new lock is complete and the twenty-four-foot-tall floodwalls have been completed, the Corps will then begin the immense task of demolishing the historic IHNC lock. Completed in the early 1920s, it was the single largest concrete structure in the City of New Orleans. With a mass of over 225,000 tons of concrete and reinforcing steel, the lock is roughly the size of the Chrysler Building lying on its side. This demolition will occur adjacent to the new floodwalls and their foundations; all resting in a very volatile geomorphology. The soil structure at the confluence of the IHNC and the Mississippi River is a roiling mixture of alluvial deposition and the hydrated sand remnants of an ancient seabed (Lake Pontchartrain). These conditions were well documented during the excavation of the IHNC and the construction of the lock required massive foundations beneath the lock chamber to ensure its stability. To date, the Corps has proposed no methodology for this undertaking or has it provided any data that this demolition will not undermine the new twenty-four foot walls that are intended to protect the city from flooding.",

Here, we are again confronted with the Corps&#8217; apparent disregard for the project\u2019s long-term impacts on those who cross the IHNC on their daily commute between St. Bernard Parish and New Orleans. There are two bridges that affect traffic over the IHNC: The St. Claude Bride and the Judge Seeber bridge at Claiborne Avenue. The Seeber Bridge can be raised and was designed for the Lake Pontchartrain water levels that are currently below it. Moving the lock to Galvez Street and bringing the higher Mississippi River water elevations below it will cause the Seeber Bridge to be raised more frequently than currently in order to allow barge traffic to pass. In addition, because of the new lock\u2019s ability to handle more than double the volume of barges and tugs as the historic complex, the duration of these openings will be increased by over forty percent (COE data). This means that both the St. Claude and Seeber bridges will be up simultaneously and for longer periods of time. The result of this thirteen-year Corps project will bring commuting to a standstill and will impact hurricane evacuation procedures from St. Bernard Parish. If you are a resident of the Lower Ninth Ward, Holy Cross or Bywater Historic Districts, the Corps is asking you to endure a minimum 13-year construction project in your backyard. As mentioned, there will be three to four years of pile driving and endless heavy equipment traffic; all adjacent to modest, shallow foundation homes and businesses. These neighborhoods have struggled to shore up residential and commercial re-development after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The proposed COE project will do nothing but stall, slow, or eliminate any progress that has been made to date. When the project is finished, there will be no direct benefits to the surrounding neighborhoods but rather, significant direct and unmitigated impacts resulting from the physical requirements of this heavy-handed project and the traffic and congestion issues that will result upon its completion. Conclusion New Orleans is one of the most endangered cities in America. Being surrounded by water, it is the home of the most intense Corps district. The Corps is broadly involved in almost every aspect of life with water and is staffed by a good many men and women who are exemplary citizens and long-term area residents. However, the Corps as a whole is a top-heavy, chain-of-command organization that is beholden to its clients. It has refused to factor into the lock project climate change, rising Mississippi River levels, the lessons of hurricanes Betsy and Katrina,\u00a0or the possibility of actually abandoning this failed dream of the Industrial Canal. Instead, this project is mired in bad ideas hatched early in the 1900s, now at a time when the region and City are struggling to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. These challenges call for more sustainable practices and projects that may be in conflict with Corps ideals. The hand of human intervention is all over our river, shipping channels and wetlands; connecting the river to the lake seems like a dangerous idea, opposition to which was most likely drowned out by the drumbeat of progress in the early twentieth century. The time has passed for high-risk channels with increasingly volatile barge traffic to be engineered into the middle of residential neighborhoods still recovering from the impacts of the last very high water. Indeed, what is evident here with the proposed Industrial Canal Lock expansion is the wish to continue the history of monumental authority used commercially to the detriment of the environment and people of our region.\u00a0 So, the problem for us now is to decide which century we must inhabit fully and in every respect for our City to survive the rising tide of planetary change.",

The park gets its name from the vast landscape of gypsum dunes. While gypsum or hydrous calcium sulfate is a common mineral found in many locations on Earth, the deposit in the New Mexico desert is rare because the geography, geology, and the water-evaporation cycles turned the gypsum into selenite crystals, which break up into sand-like particles. From 1969 to 1978, several exotic species were introduced to the New Mexico desert, specifically to provide hunting opportunities for its residents and visitors. Reports have it that the idea was initially generated by an army general, who felt that the animals would easily acclimate to the landscape of the desert, and provide hunting and tourism revenue for the state. The animals came from the overflow populations of Albuquerque Zoo. They were nested in the wilderness. The oryx, or African gemsbok, proved to be one of the most successful species introduced. From an original group of nine zoo animals, a population of thousands emerged over the course of three decades. With no natural predators, and a climate and terrain similar to their native habitats, the animals quickly acclimated. At one time threatened to extinction in their native Africa, they now thrived in the American Southwest. The animals did not stay put in the areas into which they were initially introduced, and nor were their breeding cycles properly understood during the time of their release into the wild. Populations grew quickly and without much monitoring. The animals began to populate White Sands Missile Range, the largest overland military test range and the largest military installation in the United States. It is located in the state of New Mexico and spreads across roughly 3,200 miles (8,300 km), encompassing the White Sands National Monument within it.",

At White Sands, the world entered the Atomic Age with the testing of the first atomic bomb at the Trinity Site on July 16, 1945. The aftermath of this blast created a new mineral, Trinitite, and left a significant stratagraphical impact, in advance of the future devastation it would ultimately produce. By the early 1990s, the oryx had begun to cause vehicle collisions and conflicts with missions, and to interfere with other activities on the range. A management plan was devised. A limited number of hunting expeditions were organized and arranged through a lottery system, which continues today. In 2009, over 4,000 people sought the opportunity to hunt oryx on the range. Today over 1,600 oryx are harvested each season from White Sands Missile Range. White Sands is a place of contradictions\u2014a recreational area surrounded by military testing sites and installations; a pre-atomic landscape 60 miles from where the first atomic bomb was detonated; a snowy white landscape where temperatures can reach over 110\u00b0F. If Hoover had not protected the area by designating it a national park, some speculate that it could have supplied the world with enough gypsum for drywall and construction materials for 1,000 years. The site was destined to become a World Heritage Site, but controversy over whether it would eventually impede the nearby military operations led to the passing of a bill that eventually made it illegal for the area to be designated a World Heritage Site.

                "text": "Wicked Problems In a way, the title is a paradox. Almost by definition, wicked problems cannot be modeled perfectly or completely because of the many, often-conflicting perspectives on the problem itself. We might say that all wicked problems are complex, but not all complex problems are wicked. Natural systems, such as the physical processes manifested as the Earth\u2019s climate, are an example. Scientists may disagree about exactly how those processes work and which are the most important, while still agreeing on their character and their boundaries. Any problem that involves human societies brings with it the possibility, even the likelihood, of incompatible perspectives. Poverty, overpopulation, and anthropogenic climate change are obvious examples. Poverty is always relative to some point of view; people categorized as \u201cpoor\u201d in one part of the world may have standards of living far higher than poor people in another place, while some people seen as \u201cpoor\u201d by others may not even experience their own condition as one of lack or difficulty. The causes of poverty may be construed as un- or under-employment; as a result of class warfare, lack of education, racism, or deliberate repression; as an inevitable result of economic globalization; as a national, local, or personal issue; and so on. Thus, even characterizing \u201cthe problem\u201d is fraught with issues of personal, collective, and institutional stakes. Disagreement on the nature of the problem leads to conflicting ideas about its solution. As a result, few if any societies have ever eliminated poverty. Similar things can be said about any wicked problem. Mental Models Human beings do not, and cannot, perceive the world in its full complexity. Our perceptual systems are attuned to some kinds of stimuli but ignore others. We do not see ultraviolet light at all, though it can burn our skin. We usually notice nearby moving objects, but do not see things\u2014such as the ends of our own noses\u2014which are always present in our field of vision. Our brains simplify reality, and while we can extend our perception (with difficulty, and with assistance from instruments or from other people), we normally function with highly simplified (and skewed) versions of reality that can be called \u201cmental models.\u201d In our workshop, we used the example of a simple doubling problem to show how these mental models often fail us. A piece of paper is about 0.1 mm thick. Fold the piece of paper in half, then in half again. Now it is 0.4 mm thick. Imagine that you fold the paper in half forty more times. How thick is it now? Do not use a calculator. Solving this problem engages your mental models of paper, folding, and doubling. The formula for the solution is 0.1 mm x 242\u2014yielding an answer of almost 440,000 km, greater than the distance from the Earth to the moon. In an experiment with ninety-five MIT students, none even approached the correct answer, and the same was true of our class. The example demonstrates the skewness of human beings\u2019 ability to imagine even this simple interaction of paper and doubling. It shows the need to deploy external capabilities\u2014in this case, simple mathematics\u2014to check our understanding. This is the basic principle of modeling.",

                "text": "Conceiving of the Anthropocene as a planetary phenomenon mires the concept in the methodological dilemmas of writing global history. What chronologies and geographies best capture expansive historical processes commonly associated with the Anthropocene? Some scholars reach into the deep past, situating the inaugural moments of the era in the domestication of plants and animals by humans in the Middle East and Asia. Others look to the demographic collapse of Amerindian societies and the massive ecological changes wrought by European imperialism in the Americas and around the world in the long sixteenth century. Still others emphasize more recent global transformations, pointing to the environmental repercussions of fossil-fuel-dependent industrialization in Western Europe and North America in the nineteenth century, or the globalizing capitalist model that spread across the Global South in the postwar era. Through in-depth discussion of discrete chronologies, this seminar will ask participants to weigh how Anthropocene studies can benefit from a more sustained engagement with scholarship on global history. We will discuss critiques of global history\u2019s often implicit or explicit Eurocentrism, as well as its frequent reliance on teleological narratives of modernity, and consider how critical engagements with global historiography can be constructive to Anthropocene studies. Through collective discussions of assigned readings, presentations, and writing exercises, seminar participants will have the opportunity to craft and re-examine questions, methodologies, and approaches that they are developing for their own research.",
