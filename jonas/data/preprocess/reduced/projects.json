The feedback was surprising: a rich variety of disquieting, aesthetic, accurate descriptions of unstable landscapes, relocated communities, and scattered visions of Nature, sketching an overall network of ideal relations to the Lichtenberg case in metaphorical, historical, chemical, cultural, and political ways.",

        "abstract": "The once-dominant biome of tall grass prairie found in Central Illinois was maintained through the overlapping work of Indigenous peoples, grazing bison, weather-induced fires, and the underlying, deep effects of geological and climatic forces. Environmental historians tell us these grasslands were, in geologic terms, a relatively new and fragile, biome. Their near-complete destruction, including the lifeways through which they were constituted, only took about one hundred years. The Westward expansion of the settler-colonial nation state brought legal and mechanical technologies that turned the complex landscape before it into a simplified medium for extracting row crops and coal. This field guide combines creative non-fiction and montage-based images to depict a partial history of extractive land use in Central Illinois.",

The ACP-developed inquiry into Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley engaged with questions of importance to multiple sectors and resonated with other cases in a transnational framework. We construed our approach broadly to include intersecting disciplines, a wide range of actors and experts, and historical time scales from the deep past into the future. In addition to four primary seminars, the ACP also featured plenary lectures, short workshops, a film series, performances, and a full day set aside for field visits (from historical archives and empty buildings to brownfield sites and barges) in the region.",

The city\u2019s insularity, which is at once natural and artificial, marks its specific relation to the elements. The political economy of a \u201cwater city\u201d like Venice thus constitutes an emblematic case study to address crucial cultural questions in connection with a longue-dur\u00e9e history. An inquiry into the long-term geo-environmental practices and knowledge forms of Venice offers a vantage point to reflect on the co-evolution of human inhabitation of a highly dynamic environment at threat of catastrophic shifting as we enter the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene Campus Venice (ACV) will take the case of Venice as a point of departure to collectively reflect on geo-environmental politics in the water city and beyond. Over the span of a full week, this forum will provide a space for co-learning, interdisciplinary collaborations, and comparative studies bringing together environmental scientists, artists, historians of science and technology, geologists, environmental humanity scholars, archaeologists, and architects.",

What are the concrete techniques, organisms, environments and possibly systemic dysfunctions that compose this new planetary condition? One way of describing this worldwide fabric of earthly, technological, and living systems is in terms of the Technosphere, a hybrid field of infrastructural activities that has today achieved geo-systemic parity with other spheres such as the bio-, the hydro-, and the atmosphere. In what ways does this self-optimizing system coincide or interfere with adjacent spheres? How might humans intervene in, design, or change its dynamics? Or has the technosphere become an autonomous force beyond human intentions? The second edition of the Anthropocene Campus shed light on this man-made sphere, posing the challenge of describing, understanding, and more consciously shaping a twenty-first century wherein the forces of humanity, technology, culture, life, and industry act in accordance with the biophysical possibilities and limits of our planet.",

What was a lifeline for industry\u2014logistics, transportation, power\u2014is being reimagined as a river for the twenty-first century. Bit by bit, the infrastructure that reshaped the river and facilitated the rise of the Twin Cities is being abandoned and repurposed. Take, for instance, the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock, permanently closed in 2015 to prevent the spread of invasive species. The city, the National Park Service (NPS), and others, who collectively aim to \u201creposition the Lock as a unique destination on the Central Riverfront,\u201d are harnessing this once-essential point of commercial navigation.Friends of the Lock &amp; Dam, \u201cThe Falls Initiative.\u201d The Falls, October 22, 2019: thefalls.org/about/the-falls-initiative When the US Army Corps of Engineers closed the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock, the Upper Harbor Terminal (UHT), which is the northernmost port of the Mississippi River, was rendered obsolete. Under the aegis of urban revitalization, the publicly held land that houses the UHT and forms the longest contiguous stretch of real estate on the Mississippi River has been offered to developers who have proposed building a destination music venue, housing, and commercial space on the site\u2014all heavily subsidized by taxpayers. In tandem with these developments, the Army Corps began its formal \u201cDisposition Study\u201d in 2017 to decide whether it should retain ownership of the Upper St. Anthony Lock, the Lower St. Anthony Lock and Dam near downtown Minneapolis, and Lock and Dam No.\u00a01 by the Ford Parkway Bridge. Some advocates of the potential decommissioning of the dam aim to \u201crewild\u201d the river, returning the river gorge in Minneapolis to rapids and functionally ending the Mississippi\u2019s role as an industrial river. We take these and other processes of de-industrialization in and around the Twin Cities as a starting point for an investigation of the histories and practices that formed the industrial river and the futures imagined for it. How do processes of de-industrialization open up spaces to think through the ways the river has been, and continues to be, shaped by colonial and capitalist processes? What are our investments\u2014social, financial, and personal\u2014in the river\u2019s future? How does river infrastructure\u2014present, past, and future\u2014shape the social and environmental lives of the river? We insist that positioning the Mississippi as an \u201cAnthropocene River\u201d requires an examination of the layers of social, ecological, and technical interventions made upon it. Congress first authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to construct six dams in the headwaters region between 1880 and 1907. In 1910, the Corps built America\u2019s first national dam with a hydroelectric plant at Lock and Dam No.\u00a01 in St. Paul. Today, the Corps operates a \u201cstairway of water\u201d that consists of twenty-nine locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi River between Minneapolis and St. Louis. Perhaps less well known is that a proposal for the Meeker Lock and Dam, the first lock and dam built in the Twin Cities, had already been put forward in the 1850s. This proposal imagined the river as industrial infrastructure and situated it within the singular space of the settler nation-state fifty years before building actually commenced. The remaking of the river for the circulation of commodities and the generation of electricity transformed not only the river, but the value and \u201cbest use\u201d of land adjacent to it, as the timber-, flour milling-, manufacturing-, and shipping industries claimed the riverfront. In this recounting, we must underscore that it is not possible to separate the river\u2019s industrial past and imagined futures from histories of settler colonialism, the dispossession of native land, and genocide. In the processes of claiming the river as a commercial resource, there was both a disregard for the sacredness of sites belonging to the Dakota people along the Upper Mississippi and abuse of hallowed land. Bdote, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers and central to Dakota spirituality and history, was turned into a military base and concentration camp for the Dakota themselves during the Dakota War of 1862. Similarly, an area near ancient burial mounds that became known as Pig\u2019s Eye was converted to a rail yard and a dumping ground for toxic waste. Likewise, Wakan Tipi, a cave that holds spiritual significance for Dakota and other Indigenous peoples, became the site of a brewery, rail yard, and industry. Neither can one separate the Mississippi\u2019s industrial past from the violence of slavery, anti-Blackness, and the ongoing dispossession and marginalization of African American communities. Before the Civil War, ports along the river were used extensively in the slave trade, including for transporting slaves\u2014like Dred Scott\u2014to otherwise \u201cfree\u201d states like Minnesota. In the twentieth century, zoning and redlining practices in Minneapolis segregated African American populations into neighborhoods like North Minneapolis, simultaneously barring access to the riverfront while exposing residents to the toxic effects of industry. Today, struggles over the future of the Upper Harbor Terminal carry these pasts into the present. As industries have migrated away from the river, as railroads and then interstate highways have displaced barges with trains and trucks, and as manufacturers have closed local plants to exploit cheaper labor overseas, perceptions of the river as a social, cultural, and financial resource are changing. We, as scholars, artists, and practitioners invested in the river\u2019s future, provide context for these intersecting streams of history that manifest within the de-industrializing Upper Mississippi. What is the relation between these pasts and our de-industrializing present? How do they shape today\u2019s struggles over the river\u2019s future? And how might we occasion critical reflection on the histories and futures of the industrial river? Members of the group have guided undergraduates through documentary filmmaking at the Upper Harbor Terminal, led public tours of the terminal and Lock and Dam No.\u00a01, and commissioned this set of reflective essays on the contested histories and futures of the river publicly available as part of the larger Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project. The commissioned essays are at once critical and poetic and range from personal histories of resource extraction in the river headwaters, competing visions for the Upper Harbor Terminal, desires to \u201crewild\u201d the Mississippi Gorge, settler colonialism, and indigenous water futures in the Anthropocene. Other essays shine a light on the role of real estate capital in remaking the postindustrial river, excavate the many social and geological layers of Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary, and attend to continuities and discontinuities between imagined river futures today and the settler-colonial futures embodied in the original mid-nineteenth-century plans for the Meeker Lock and Dam.",

Framed as both \u201crestoration of nature\u201d and \u201crisk mitigation,\u201d green infrastructure activities have gained prominence and financing ever since Hurricane Katrina hit the coast of Louisiana. Following the 2005 hurricane season, the newly established Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) authored a\u00a0Coastal Master PlanState of Louisana, Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana, Master Plan for a Sustain Coast. Louisiana: OTS-State Printing, 2017, online with the aim of directing investments toward reducing storm-surge flood risk for coastal communities and protecting an array of commercial and recreational activities. Currently in the third cycle of its \u201cPlan,\u201d this project leverages the State\u2019s 2023 Plan drafting process to understand how planners are tabulating the benefits of risk reduction within specific parts of the Delta and how nature is being employed to protect against the future impacts of natural phenomena. How, in other words, do we make sense of \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d as an increasing response to risk in the Anthropocene? The Plan\u2019s frame of reference for managing vulnerability is the region: In lieu of discrete, project-sized interventions, regionalized risk reduction focuses on both landscape-scale restoration and a series of small but interlinked interventions. Yet, with limited resources, priorities for protection nonetheless are aimed at specific assets and activities within the state, which the rhetoric around the regional integrity of restoration efforts partly occludes. What is seen as worthy of protection and what is sacrificed? And how is the reconstruction of natural assets conceived and financed toward meeting these goals of \u201cacceptable loss\u201d? One of the principal \u201ctools\u201d identified by the Plan is using natural wetlands and other landscapes as defenses against flooding from storms. This attention to soil replenishment reverses decades of commercial activity directed at extracting and undermining these \u201cnatural assets.\u201d Deploying methods of participant observation and interviews, this research will involve visiting two to three of these sites of natural infrastructure with project developers to understand how the valuations assigned through planning documents are converted into material nature, i.e. barrier islands, ridge and marsh restoration, oyster reefs, etc. In addition to thinking about what determines \u201cacceptable loss,\u201d the project will also focus on mapping specific green-infrastructure professions and practices: What forms of expertise is the state mobilizing to make this redemption of nature a reality; and how does the engineered imaginary of nature influence calculations of benefit and value? And how, finally, do these interventions articulate or participate in notions of equitable risk\u2014the equal sharing out of vulnerability across populations and territories? These largely public investments (local, state, and federal funds; implementation of the 2017 Plan is estimated at 50 billion dollars) also interact with other mechanisms of risk management, such as insurance, and the tools that help determine insurability, such as catastrophe models. A special focus will fall on the linking of public investments in vulnerability-reduction with circuits of private-risk mitigation capital.",

Using underwater recordings gathered in 2015 by artists Monica Haller and Sebastian M\u00fcllauer that span the river from the headwaters to the Gulf, Listening to the Mississippi asks listeners to orient themselves to the river through their sense of sound, rather than by sight alone. The project seeks to understand the Mississippi as a dynamic condition that includes the past and the present and stretches across a great distance. Through the use of mobile listening packs that include headphones, a felted mat, and listening notes, the project cultivates distinct moments of engagement that accumulate through compilations of sound and the activation of other senses: sight, smell, and even touch.",

Located in Adams County, on the banks of the Mississippi River, Natchez is one of the oldest cities in the region, and was a major hub across the South from its \u201cfounding\u201d by French colonizers in 1716 (then named Fort Rosalie; renamed Natchez in 1730) until the postwar era. Natchez was the name the colonists gave to the Theloel nation of Native Americans who had lived in the region since the 7th century CE; later known as the Natchez Indians, the French had annihilated them by 1730. We consider Natchez as a diachronic \u201ccritical case,\u201d offering a synecdochic site of Anthropocenic emergence on multiple axes. Functioning as a sychecdoche\u2014where the workings of the \u201cparts\u201d illuminate the workings of the \u201cwhole\u201d\u2014the processes that unfolded here over a 500-year period not only mirror but also illuminate the dynamics of the Anthropocene\u2019s emergence, more generally, and in many crucial ways. Natchez offers a palimpsestic site to explore the entangled causal mechanisms that made institutional, pragmatic \u201cflesh\u201d of an ideological, ideational \u201cworld\u201d as the Anthropocene unfolded. From settler-colonial occupation and indigenous genocide to industrial-scale chattel slavery and a brutal domestic slave trade; from the rise of the ecologically disastrous agricultural-monocrop Plantationocene, powered by the coerced labor of enslaved persons, to the spread of so-called \u201cinvasive species\u201d introduced to combat soil erosion; and from the riparian and alluvial vicissitudes of the Mississippi River, to the contemporary era\u2019s turn towards fracking and hydrocarbon exploration in the State, concentrated in and around Adams County. In particular, Natchez shows the complex and consequential entanglement of the twin concepts of white supremacism and human exceptionalism and their intertwined instantiations in genocide and ecocide, giving form and motivational force to the emergent Anthropocene conditions along the Mississippi since the start of the colonial era. Exploring new methods of research within the historical and contemporary Natchez context, members of our multidisciplinary team (Ellie Irons, Montana Torrey, and Maya K\u00f3vskaya) are investigating the embodiment of macro-narratives within micro-processes. We are treating these as synecdochic cases that instantiate in site-specific artworks, workshops, interventions, and/or historical narratives that speak to larger Anthropocene processes more generally, whilst retelling the stories of the Natchez along the Mississippi.",

Spanning a broad range of disciplines, the initiative seeks to use the parallax effect to engage with the issues of environmental and social transformation and collapse that the term Anthropocene highlights. To that end, the initiative organizes discussions around two intertwined and complementary, but often divorced frameworks: on the one hand, the systems of social and technological organization, determining which actions are possible within a given historical context; and, on the other, perception and narrative, determining our limits for understanding and imagining.

Playing creatively with thematics and concepts from history, evolutionary biology, chemistry and resource management, physics, the arts, technology, and complexity theory, the seminar provoked some remarkable conversations, which brought new insight to an understanding of the long-term historical dynamics behind the creation of the Anthropocene, the extent (or absence) of human agency therein, and the power structures behind these developments. The seminar unfolded in a series of highly stimulating plenary discussions, followed by intermediary sessions in three working groups, and concluding with a brief exercise in creating a timeline for the Anthropocene, which brought into view the different multi-scale and multilayered temporalities embedded in the concept. Highlights from the plenary discussions are available in an edited transcript. The working groups revolved around three basic themes: one that explored directly the concept of the technosphere and its level of autonomy; one devoted to applying the concept of co-evolution through storytelling; and a last that was concerned with analyzing and debating the political and economic structures behind the technosphere and the Anthropocene. Owing to the formidable cross-disciplinary nature of these discussions, the contributions that emerged directly from the seminar aptly reflect a variety of approaches and formats. One contribution consists in a sheep-shaped measuring tape, used as a technological and standardization tool that enables collaboration and communication and scales down the Anthropocene to something more concrete and tangible. Two seminar participants contributed an academic paper that investigates homeostasis and feedbacks as guiding concepts, in order to compare the Earth in the Anthropocene to a dynamic biological system with its own anthropogenic forms of niche constructions, and to look at the implications between human beings and the planet. The third contribution is a fictional tale exploring the vulnerabilities of the system exposed through a future outbreak of an epidemic in which the distinction between humans and bacteria finally vanishes. Confronted with an undifferentiated anthropocenic nexus in which no boundaries exist, what then remains of the system that is the technosphere, not to speak of an optimized technospheric system?",

Entering the term \u201cAnthropocene\u201d into a Google image search, however (which was our real-world case study), resulted in a visually colorful, but stunningly shallow, imagery of the Anthropocene. The leading results seemed to lack historical and cultural nuance, political, sociological, and anthropological depth and intellectual creativity, and even the scientific images tended to be iconographic cartoons of complexities rather than images of a new age of connectedness, intersection, and coevolution rooted in the present and its histories. The most astounding feature of the search, however, was the far-reaching absence of the originator and receiver her- and himself: Anthropos. In light of this, the intention of the seminar was to produce\u2014along the lines of four guiding themes: \u201cTerra Forming,\u201d \u201dAnthropos,\u201d \u201cThe Nonhuman,\u201d and \u201cTimes: Before and After\u201d\u2014a bundle of new imaginations of the Anthropocene that address its dimensions more convincingly and provide critical reflexivity on existing interpretations. This required that our investigations strive for a particular\u00a0punctum\u00a0that can pique interest and hold attention in the realm of digital memes and viral transmissions. We hoped, along with accompanying short texts, to open up the deeper foundations of the Anthropocene and to release more creativity about potential alternative futures than were found in our real-world case study.",

The first case study, summarized by Pablo Jensen, used the Schelling segregation model, and shows how individuals who each genuinely desire to live in a racially mixed neighborhood can nevertheless collectively, against their best intentions, produce a segregated town as they each seek optimal housing for themselves. Isabell Schrickel, in a second case study, introduces Crawford S. Holling\u2019s concept of adaptive modeling, through which models are understood as tools of self-instruction and collective learning about complex systems and their possible future trajectories. In \u201cLimits to Growth,\u201d Miriam Diamond picks up this most famous publication of 1972 that alerted the world to the likelihood of collapse in both human and natural systems. The final major exercise, introduced by Chris Strashok, allowed students to use the Global Systems Simulator, a sophisticated integrated assessment model, to explore avenues toward achieving sustainability by manipulating a wide range of factors, from population and production to agriculture and pollution.

However, sensing could be transformed through more-than-human and environmental affiliations that distribute sensation rather than make it the privileged domain of cognizing humans. This seminar, part of The Shape of a Practice public programme, explored how default approaches to sensing are a product of specific cultural, political, or even human habits.

                "text": "About the Following Contributions In contrast to ecosystems, which tend towards equilibrium and create no waste, social systems build up deficits, are vulnerable to stress, and produce waste. Valuing nature so as to imagine zero socio-ecosystemic debt societies, and distinguishing between price and cost issues, therefore, is of utmost urgency in the Anthropocene.    The paper \u201cFrom valuing nature to reclaiming resources,\u201d by Ioan Negrutiu and colleagues, frames an exercise in argumentation this way: assessing our resources and permanently accounting for their usage and allocation are imperative for imagining and designing societies that are socio-ecosystemically resilient. In this way a vision of a resource-centered \u201cslow/soft\u201d Anthropocene is emerging, a practical application for which is appended to the paper. A second exercise executed during the seminar, which focused on Berlin-based actors, sought to understand how society engaged with the transition process. In this context, Herbert Lohner expands on robust mechanisms for effective sustainability strategies in the achievement of sustainable development targets in the city of Berlin. Environmental responsibility begins with properly quantifying the human impact on ecosystems and then making use of the metrics of nature-valuation to preserve high-quality life-supporting systems in the long term. This is indeed feasible, because quantitative and modeling tools are more available today than they were in the past. Yet, in the past, understanding nature\u2019s value in an economic sense became the common instrument for balancing the human impact. This is illustrated by Sabine H\u00f6hler\u2019s presentation, \u201cTaking Nature into Account\u2014Historical Perspectives and Paradoxes,\u201d which discusses how in the Age of Enlightenment, scientific and economic practices merged to represent the perfect order of nature and state. Finally, an artistic approach to an alternative \u201ccultural-shift\u201d scenario is presented in Natalie Jeremijenko\u2019s project \u201cTree X Office.\u201d If the human capacity to own property bestows political agency, independence, and even personhood upon the owner, what would happen if a tree is given this same capacity?",

One of the peculiarities of this site is that the island is defined as a portion of the state of Missouri that happens to lie to the east of the Mississippi. Although this is not unique\u2014there are other small crescent-shaped slices of land that disobey the general rule of west-of-the-Mississippi=Missouri and east-of-the-Mississippi=Illinois\u2014it suggests that the mutability of the river\u2019s course has been a factor in legally defining territorial boundaries in the past, and that the literal terraforming program of building levees to fix the river\u2019s course along its length is obviously a contradiction of the true nature of the Mississippi. This has been dramatized by the way the river has (over the course of several months of high water levels) seeped through the levees to such an extent that even if the water did not overtop the barriers, farmland on the supposedly dry side of levees and roads has been slowly inundated and rendered impossible to cultivate. We had specifically intended to return to this levee road in summer 2019 to record additional video footage and field audio, but the reality of the situation created by the significant flooding throughout the upper Midwest since January 2019 has resulted in damage to many locations that were accessible to us last year. Consequently, the relevant authorities in Jackson County have denied access to the same roads that we drove on previously. In response, we were compelled to select alternate sites for production recordings. Witnessing the distressed situation prompted us to reflect on the seriousness of the results wrought by such methods of geoengineering; as one local resident later told us, this was the worst flooding he had experienced in his 83 years.",
