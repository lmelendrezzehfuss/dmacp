Mud was dumped in there from the treatment plant, which was the last part of the mining industry in the region to close down. This once-thriving little village, which had twenty-four bars, a forty-six-piece village band, hostels and schools, a cinema and theater, and even a police station, is now mainly residential with a few bars and restaurants. It has become a popular recreational destination, with visitors mainly from Greater Bilbao and beyond. The traditional dish of the miners, a bean stew, is famous in the region and many village restaurants serve it. Today, the area surrounding the water-filled mines is a recreational park (Pe\u00f1as Negras) with picnic and barbeque facilities. It is popular for fishing (swimming is not permitted), walking, biking, and horse-riding. Although the original mining infrastructure is no longer extant, there is a mining museum. The village itself has some interesting features: for example, while its architecture is of a style unique in the Basque country, the same construction is seen in a number of mining communities around Asturias and Cantabria. Perhaps also worthy of note is the fact that, with many of the miners coming from outside the Basque country, some of the local toponyms were \u201ccastilianized\u201d (for example, Larra\u00f1eta to La Reineta). In socioeconomic terms, the importance of Trapagaran extends well beyond the village itself, as the mining industry enhanced Bilbao\u2019s economic development a great deal. Although small-scale ironworks already existed in the area, 1902 saw an English\u2012Basque partnership that culminated in the creation of the Biscay\u2019s emblematic Altos Hornos (a huge ironworks complex). With its mineral resources and proximity to the seaport, and the area\u2019s metallurgical tradition, Bilbao was a prime location. After the Spanish Civil War, during Spain\u2019s rural exodus, the Basque industry attracted people from all over the country. Altos Hornos turned out to be crucial for Bilbao\u2019s industrialization.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<div>\n<div class=\"_3ngFjWKpOr0BV7e4JfgnKT\">\n<h3>Past and present interconnections<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Hyr12l29RPHGMCN6zHqsG\">\n<div class=\"font-serif width-wide text-left columns-2\">\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately we know little about how the early mineral exploitation and possible settlements connect (or overlap) with the more recent ones.<\/li>\n<li>The landscape has changed considerably (certainly since industrial exploitation in the nineteenth century): with human settlement, mining infrastructure, the disappearance of a mountain, and the appearance of three new lakes. The vegetation has also now largely recovered from the scars inflicted by open-cast mining activity.<\/li>\n<li>The cable railway has become a tourist attraction and the area has a heritage center relating to the history of Bilbao\u2019s mining past. One of the sociopolitical implications of this renaissance is the bringing together of the left and right banks of the Nervi\u00f3n River (<em>margen izquierda<\/em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>margen derecha<\/em>).

Is this sculpture about Anthropos returning something to the geology; is it about making the mark of Anthropos even deeper?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"toolbar row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"_1__3DVlafGDUFDhvnuRMll\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3191,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:24","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:24","post_content":"","post_title":"Maialen Galarraga (Maia)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"maialen-galarraga-maia","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:46:51","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:46:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/maialen-galarraga-maia\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/maialen-galarraga-maia\/","acf":{"first_name":"Maialen","last_name":"Galarraga "}}],"projects":[{"ID":20767,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2014-11-23 18:11:58","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 17:11:58","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">Anthropogenic Landscapes ground us in the Anthropocene.

A flash fieldwork trip to the former VEB Elektrokohle (People\u2019s Enterprise Electro-coal) in Berlin-Lichtenberg helped us to observe, study, and reshape the shift from the larger context down to the local.<\/p>\n <p>Can the Anthropocene be experienced directly, in the real world, on the ground? Human transformation of the Earth is simultaneously global and local, immediate and geological, fundamentally real and absolutely abstract, intimately personal and completely collective. Within the framework of the Anthropocene, somehow, everything is connected in both human time and geological time.<\/p>\n<p>The Anthropocene considers anthropogenic landscapes as outcomes of deep time processes, but also as archaeological sites, habitats to conserve for endangered species, designed spaces, up-and-coming neighborhoods, brownfields, artworks, social networks, problems to be solved\u2014a list that continues to grow.<\/p>\n<p>In this seminar, we investigated the site of the former VEB Elektrokohle (People\u2019s Enterprise Electro-coal) in Berlin-Lichtenberg\u2014today a highly contaminated site, mainly characterized by, among other enterprises, the \u201cDong Xuan Center,\u201d a conglomerate of shops, restaurants, and places of cultural practices, mostly belonging to the numerous Berlin-based Vietnamese community. The aim of this case study was to explore the site\u2019s meaning to both large and small scales of time and space, by connecting these with the action of local actors and local communities. People embody, and reflect in the space they inhabit, the social and economic changes occurring in the larger context. Through case-study analysis we aimed to foster the development of specific conceptual and practical tools; we aimed to experience the anthropocenic dimensions performed by the communities through the landscapes we observe on the ground, within our mind, and through our cultures.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Anthropogenic Landscapes","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-anthropogenic-landscapes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-30 17:07:22","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-30 15:07:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20767","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-anthropogenic-landscapes\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":20768,"id":20768,"title":"Benedikt Rugar_Anthropogenic Landscapes","filename":"HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes.jpg","filesize":1729963,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-anthropogenic-landscapes\/hkw_anthropogenic-landscapes\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_anthropogenic-landscapes","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20767,"date":"2020-02-27 17:12:22","modified":"2020-03-02 10:37:55","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":7418,"height":4800,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-768x497.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":497,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-300x194.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":194,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-768x497.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":497,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-1400x906.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":906,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":994,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1325,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-1600x1035.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1035}},"teaser_text":"<p class=\"text\">Anthropogenic Landscapes ground us in the Anthropocene.
