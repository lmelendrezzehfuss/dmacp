It is a tried and true method of engagement. There are many rewards and pleasures that come from eating rare and carefully preserved foods. These foods, like the American wild persimmon found in the Midwest, often circulate story and mythology in and of themselves. It behooves us to pay attention not only to these foods for their ecologic significance, but also to the accompanying narratives and from what perspective they are told. There are many hidden hierarchies in these stories that lead to an accumulated homogenization of cultural capital. Like seeds, we pass these stories from one generation to the next by what comes natural to us: our collective practice of cooking and eating. When we consciously eat these foods, we participate in an ideological arc of past, grounded in the present and future.<\/p>\n<p>Baked into the idea of \u201ceating it to save it\u201d is the anthropocentric relationship that humans have with biodiversity through breeding and natural selection. As much as the rise and fall of biodiversity on Earth has happened outside the realm of human interaction, the biodiversity of what we call food has very much to do with human interaction. This relationship has been well documented throughout time, and especially here, in the American Bottom\u2014the extensive floodplains of the East St. Louis region. The ongoing work of paleoethnobotanists, whose archeological data goes back some 5,000 years, demonstrates how humans have manipulated plant productivity through seed selection from prehistory to present times.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>See \u201cField Station 3: Post-natural Landscapes,\u201d https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/events\/field-station-3-post-natural-landscapes.<\/span><\/span> To understand that history helps us to understand farmland as a kind of cultural landscape where the production of space and human patterns are accumulated and impressed upon the contours of the natural environment,<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Dolores Hayden, <em>The Power of Place: Urban Landscapes as Public History<\/em>.

But the more we look, the more we find ourselves intertwined at every level. This project, <em>Edible Encounters along the Mississippi<\/em>, used a methodology of enactment and encounter to investigate examples of native biodiversity and foods of significance in the Confluence region. Working with edible matter can be particularly thrilling because it is alive. Like us, plants and seeds and animals are biologically programmed to reproduce. We can attempt to seek this life through an exploration of the landscape in the liminal sidelines of the river, looking for undomesticated, latent, lost, or forgotten examples of what has <em>become<\/em> wild.<\/p>\n<p>As an instructive investigation\u2014on the river, with students\u2014<em>Edible Encounters<\/em> presented foods linked to place. It used specific assemblages of vegetables, nuts, beans, and other foods as curated objects that were then prepared in a group encounter and transformed into meals that have linkages to histories of place. The foods are intended to be eaten in order to be \u201csaved,\u201d or at least preserved, through a continuity of experience placed in a collective memory.<\/p>\n<p><em>Edible Encounters<\/em> also pursued relations between food and place in unforeseen encounters with the wild (what still gets called \u201cwilderness\u201d)<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Cronon William, <em>Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature.<\/em> New York: W. W. Norton, 1995, pp. 69-90.<\/span><\/span>, offering a temporal investigation in what the place has to offer through foraging. Foraging asks us to look in detail at the landscape and ask, \u201cWhat is edible here?\u201d It enables us to seek real time and sometimes fleeting assemblages of edible material. Importantly, it calls upon the capital of knowledge and the currency of culture to know how to recognize the findings and what to do with them. Foraging along the banks of the Mississippi River offers an opportunity to recognize remnants of ecologic autonomy in pockets of wilderness contrasted against the larger surroundings of industry and agricultural monocultures. It allows us to imagine narratives and micro eco-communities that diverge from the vast monocultures and veer from the anthropocenic.<\/p>\n<p>If you look at farmland adjacent to the Mississippi River today, you will not be shocked to see that the majority of field crops are contemporary monocultures, like corn and soy. These productive landscapes are the very opposite of biodiversity. In fact, fifteen or so miles of river adjacent to St. Louis and Illinois represents the transfer of so much commodity grain production infrastructure from land to water that it is known as the Agriculture Coast. From here, the grain barges move down the river to distribute their cargo for processing and export. Looking carefully at the places affected by the industrialized river economy, we see a well-worn landscape of urbanism, industry, and monoculture that belies this local industry\u2019s significance at the global scale.<\/p>\n<p>The influence of corn in particular is worth lingering on for a moment. As one of the world\u2019s central commodities, corn plays a critical role in global food security today. It is also one of the most quintessential crops within the American identity. This elevated status may relate to the cultural emphasis on corn for the role it played in human settlement and agriculture, as it spread from its origin in Central America throughout North America. In the pre-Columbian city of Cahokia, adjacent to the Mississippi River and along the American Bottom, archaeologists date the adoption of maize at roughly 1000 ce. But it was only in the last century that it grew to become the dominant form of agricultural identity in the Midwest.<\/p>\n<p><em>Edible Encounters<\/em> gave us an opportunity to observe the contrast between the wild bursts of biodiversity in the marginal areas along the river and the widespread control of nature exemplified by the endless cornfields in this region. These series of edible encounters and territorial mash-ups offered interpretations of foods that have bioregional origins or are part of long-standing Indigenous traditions or both. It was an opportunity to look to Indigenous knowledge, tradition, and creativity to build collective narratives and memory through the shared experience of taste. Like the Mississippi River itself, these encounters paired planning with spontaneity and required participants to go with the flow.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":24914,"id":24914,"title":"IMG_1823_Edible Encounters","filename":"IMG_1823-scaled.jpeg","filesize":399531,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-scaled.jpeg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/edible-encounters-along-the-mississippi-river\/img_1823\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"by Lynn Peemoeller","caption":"St. Louis skyline from the river","name":"img_1823","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":24328,"date":"2020-04-30 09:41:20","modified":"2020-05-12 14:48:14","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1920,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-768x576.jpeg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":576,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-300x225.jpeg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":225,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-768x576.jpeg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":576,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-1400x1050.jpeg","large-width":1400,"large-height":1050,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-1536x1152.jpeg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1152,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-2048x1536.jpeg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1536,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-48x48.jpeg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_1823-1600x1200.jpeg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<h2>Edible Encounter 1: Mosenthein Island, eight miles north of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis<\/h2>\n<p><em>Quinoa with turkey broth, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and lamb\u2019s quarters<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The assemblage of ingredients for this <em>Edible Encounter<\/em> represents an overlap of geography of the Americas, as well as of time periods, with some demonstratable connectivity between past and present.

The corn provides poles for the beans to climb up; the beans fix the soil with nitrogen, which benefits the other plants; and the wide leaves of the squash block out sunlight, retaining moisture and minimizing weeds. When cooked together, it is believed that their various enzymes work together to make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins more accessible to the body. Hominy is dried corn that has been nixtamalized, or soaked in an alkaline solution, which helps to dissolve the tough outer skin of the kernel.

Cherokee today continue to make kunuche, a hickory-nut soup that begins with a laborious process of cracking and pounding the nuts and then forming the resulting paste into a ball for storage. When it is time to make the soup, the ball is dissolved in hot water, the shell fragments are picked out, and various other ingredients are added, such as rice, hominy, sugar, and salt.<\/p>\n<p>We wanted to attempt to reenact this process on the river. However, I was not able to obtain a large enough amount of hickory nuts, so instead I was able to locally source a significant amount of <strong>American hazelnut<\/strong> (<em>Corylus americana<\/em>). We river travelers toasted the nuts over an open fire, pounded them to release the nuts from their shells, and sampled them. From a larger batch of already shelled hazelnuts, we pounded out a coarse meal, to which we added water and then placed over an open campfire. As the nuts boiled, diced <strong>apples<\/strong> (<em>Malus pumila<\/em>) were added along with big spoonfuls of dough, which turned into puffy cornmeal dumplings\u2014made primarily from stone-ground cornmeal from the historic Weisenberger Mill in Kentucky.<\/p>\n<p>The primary inspiration of the rice dish was the <strong>wild grape<\/strong>. Missouri is home to both cultivated and wild native grape species (<em>Vitis labrusca<\/em> and <em>Vitis riparia<\/em>). On our river journey, we found abundant wild grape vines along the shores of the Mississippi, but, in early October, there were no grapes left on the vine. However, the leaves were collected and boiled in salted water, making them tender and releasing a surprising sour, tangy taste. The boiled leaves were added to a Middle Eastern\u2013themed pilaf of rice, raisins, and fried onions.<\/p>\n<p>This meal was an attempt to enact the seasonal processing of hickory nuts, which has been vital to the nutrition of the Indigenous Peoples of this region as far back as the Late Paleoindian period (over 10,000 years ago).

That is to say, through seeds, we can date the beginning of a preferential system for plant selection, domestication, and landscape change in relation to human settlements in this region. Archeologic evidence suggests at least five native plants, known as lost crops, to have been the foundation for unique local agro-ecosystems. Yet this significant period of our agricultural heritage has largely been eclipsed by \u201cZeacentrism,\u201d the focus on maize as the enabler of (North American) civilization.
