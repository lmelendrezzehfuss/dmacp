As our lives become more steeped in media technologies, the freedom to opt out may disappear, which can lead to a democratic problem in itself. Corporate discourse and the productivism that have seeped into our social and personal lives place an enormous pressure on us to remain connected. In many circumstances, such as in academia, we are already expected to work anywhere, all the time. Connectedness has been used to erase the boundaries between work and everything else. By participating in this process, we are complicit with a background level of exploitation that is the motor of the social media industry (not to mention corporate and state surveillance). Our (digital) social relations are effectively commercialized. Thus, Slow Media is not just about reclaiming time from distractions and the alluring light of the screen. At face value, it seems to include an ethics of resistance to the dominant corporate ideology. However, this conclusion can be further problematized.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, slowness can also provide a framework that goes beyond categorizations based on cultural background, taste and class, such as high and lowbrow, or classifications such as mainstream and counterculture, which have been compromised by the dissolution of mass culture into increasingly fragmented subcultures, and capitalism\u2019s assimilation of its own critique.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Mark Fisher,\u00a0<em>Capitalist Realism: Is there no alternative?<\/em>\u00a0Winchester: Zero Books, 2009, pp. 8\u201210.<\/span><\/span>\u00a0By placing an emphasis on our relationship with media, rather than the form or content of media, Slow Media further underlines the inadequacy of these categories in contemporary discourse.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, slow movements have been criticized on the basis of their relation to concepts such as class, taste and privilege, and the slow media movement needs to be examined in this regard. Heather Mendick has pointed out that \u201cSlow is both classed and gendered, re\/producing a particular relationship to self, which requires not just stability of employment but an individualist way of being, constituting selves that calculate and invest on themselves for the future.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Heather Mendick, \u201cSocial Class, Gender and the Pace of Academic Life: What kind of solution is slow?,\u201d <em>Forum for Qualitative Social Research<\/em>, vol. 15, no. 3 (2014).<\/span><\/span>\u00a0As an example, within academia Slow does not necessarily mean \u201cwork less,\u201d instead it means \u201cwork more with what is important,\u201d in other words research, as opposed to administrative tasks and mailing etc. On the other hand, the possibility of giving up these tasks rests on the obligation for someone else to do them.

Most of the time, those who are working less today not through choice, but compulsion, are completely absent from the discourse. The slow pace of those people, who do not have the privilege to be able to slow down, instead tends to be seen as laziness. Thus, the kind of slowness being valued depends on the social context of the actor.<\/p>\n<p>As pointed out by author Tracie McMillan regarding slow food: \u201cWhen the food movement poses home cooking as a moral choice, it is making a pretty alienating, class-based argument. . . . We have to value work in the home.

He suggests that comics should look instead for \u201crecognition\u201d of their own attributes and merits, placing an emphasis on individual achievements and not on the virtues of an entire medium. This \u201cpost-legitimate\u201d environment has also seen a general opening up of comics to the discourse and formalities of the fine arts, as in the works of authors such as Gary Panter, Yuichi Yokoyama, and CF. This movement is not unidirectional, but radiating, frequently involving a mix of references and aesthetic vocabulary from low- and highbrow sources, further undermining any attempts at categorization. Thus, it seems that when everything is fair game, comics are encouraged to expand in form and content, in an increasing dialogue with other arts.<\/p>\n<p>But whether comics are or should be an institutionalized art form, is just part of the crisis of identity of comics in traditional paradigms.

In addition, they are produced through an assembly line-like process that involves several writers and artists. These creators are hired to continuously develop characters and series in never-ending narratives within a shared universe, all of it owned by the publishing house. The extremely intertwined nature of these narratives produces captivating results in fictional world building, while compelling the reader to buy as many titles as possible, in order to comprehend all the ramifications of these stories.<\/p>\n<p>So, even though they are a niche product for an extremely engaged audience, the making of superhero comics approximates industrial standards of production, accompanied by narrative strategies that promote compulsory consumerism. Generally speaking, it is an industry that awards the ability to work fast and produce derivative and easily recognizable material. This is not to say that all superhero comics are highly derivative, or that derivation\u00a0<em>per se<\/em>\u00a0is inherently bad. Even though they comprise an industry in which their creative process resembles an assembly line-like process, the fact is that these works are still performed through a complex collaborative artistic process, similar to that the slow media proponents advocate. In fact, this industrial process is still able to harbor countless celebrated works for their technical and artistic achievement.<\/p>\n<p>From a material point of view, comics-making is very time-consuming, and is generally a solitary occupation (some artists work in shared studios).

It is a very accessible visual narrative media in terms of production, even if it requires extensive training and practice (many comics artists are self-taught), and even if its vocabulary (i.e. the conventions of comics such as word balloons) isn\u2019t as universal as it is usually proposed to be. It is also a very powerful means to construct whole fictional universes without resorting to expensive means, collaborators, and technology.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, the cultural status of comics depends on who we ask. They can be simultaneously high- and lowbrow, industrial and authorial, mainstream and countercultural. Pinpointing comics as a whole along these axes will only reinforce the obsolescence of their criteria. Their slowness also allows us to make significant (and often conflicting) observations on their actual and potential value as a general creative and communication process.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><strong>Collectability and compulsory consumerism<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As Charles Hatfield states, both the \u201cmainstream\u201d and the \u201calternative\u201d comics embody a \u201ccurious mix of values, a blend of countercultural iconoclasm, rapacious consumerism, and learned connoisseurship,\u201d on the one hand appreciating their outsider status, and on the other vying for wider public and institutional recognition.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Hatfield,\u00a0<em>Alternative Comics<\/em>, p. xii.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Cyclically, superhero publishers resort to strategies of increasing sales by appealing to the collectible value of their comics or by interconnecting stories to coerce their readers into buying many more titles.

Overall, these are authors that use comics as a cheap mode of expression, to produce works with highbrow intentions. Even though they distance themselves from the formulas of mass culture, and generally favor a critical perspective on comics and the broader society, they can still be regarded as favoring consumerism, offering alternative consumptions, rather than an alternative to consumer culture.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the lines blur at comic book stores, where we can find mainstream, independent, and even self-published comics (naturally, with varying degrees of prominence). At the same time, comic book stores are places of social engagement, where customers go to buy but also to discuss comics in their various manifestations. In this regard, comics in general are not necessarily aligned with a culture of careful management of resources, even though an attention to the object can promote a deeper engagement with the floppy magazine, or the book, and their mechanical and material properties. Nevertheless, a culture of resistance to dominant values based on commercial success still exists, in particular in the more restricted circles of self-publishing and comics zines.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><strong>Future reflections: What can slow be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What do we show in our discussion about comics as slow media?

The idea of the Anthropocene demands thinking about a Long Now\u2014that is, not just a single human lifetime but up to seven generations, as suggested by <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/longnow.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Long Now Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To this we added the global imaginary, the Big Here: the local is now planetary in scale. An Anthropocene imaginary demands a sense of global citizenship and a consciousness on the part of an observer that includes their great-grandparents and their great-children. Having a \u201cglobal soul\u201d (to use Pico Iyer\u2019s term) and dwelling across generations stretches and stresses the human sense of self. The idea of doing such imagining at a slower pace in a physical place or with real objects, offers an alternative to the \u201csound bite\u201d approach to communicating complex ideas. One way to make the idea of slowing down concrete and accessible is through extending our understanding of the museum as a place that exhibits and preserves objects and artifacts. With the idea of an imaginary museum that holds individual objects and collections the seminar wants to offer new tools not only for people working in museums, but for everyone seeking alternative ways to educate students and citizens to think about global change and ways of living in the Anthropocene.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Slow
