Segregation, he said, has continued in the South through means of economic inequalities.

No matter how blurry our landmarks might have been, they bluntly forced us to situate ourselves in the environment in which we had landed from Paris only the night before. As we were sitting in the foggy atmosphere of the secret sports-jazz place, listening to the shattering testimonies of our host, I was submerged in questions that I have spent weeks trying to unpack. I will spare you the \u201cWho am I?\u201d existential type\u2014glaringly evident here\u2014and go straight to the \u201cWhat am I here for?\u201d ones, which I believe carry more heuristic accuracy in this case.<\/p>\n<p>Duncan and I had been invited for a residency in the Southeastern United States, supported by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in Atlanta, Georgia. During this residency, we decided to follow the participants of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-journey\"><em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em><\/a> from their last field station to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-campus-the-human-delta\"><em>Anthropocene River Campus<\/em><\/a> at New Orleans. Duncan is an actor and a theater maker, specialized in the use of research material on stage to explore presentations of the contemporary condition that break away from classical theater standards. I work on the emergence of the Anthropocene hypothesis in the worlds of the arts and the humanities at the Ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure\u2019s\u00a0Sciences, Arts, Creation and Research laboratory. Both of us were trained in ecological thought and political art, and deeply inspired by Donna Haraway when she wrote: \u201cIt matters which stories tell stories, which concepts think concepts. Mathematically, visually, and narratively, it matters which figures figure figures, which systems systematize systems.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Donna Haraway, \u201cAnthropocene, Capitalocene, Plantationocene, Chthulucene: Making Kin,\u201d <em>Environmental Humanities<\/em>, vol. 6, no. 1 (2015): pp. 159\u201365.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As I was trying to study, as part of my PhD thesis, the many stories that have been told about the Anthropocene, I stopped on the HKW\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/hkw.de\/en\/programm\/projekte\/2014\/anthropozaen\/anthropozaen_2013_2014.php\"><em>Anthropocene Project<\/em><\/a><em> . <\/em>It was the very first pluridisciplinary research platform concerned with the geological hypothesis, and many of the actors and agents I had been looking at were involved. With environmental history, I have learned that even thoughts have environments, and I found a way to situate mine through the <em>Anthropocene Project\u2019s <\/em>curatorial narratives. The documentation of the project also became common ground for Duncan and I. We looked at the discourses of the inaugural meeting of the Anthropocene Working Group,<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>The broadcast can be listened to here: Haus der Kulturen der Welt, \u201cHuman Impacts and Its Consequences\u201d: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hkw.de\/en\/app\/mediathek\/video\/32065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.hkw.de\/en\/app\/mediathek\/video\/32065<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>which was given a stage at a performative and cultural institution rather than at one or another geological society, as one might have expected. After this meeting, Duncan and I wrote a play called <em>Matters<\/em>, a polyphonic assemblage in which Duncan transforms the historical, scientific, and political voices of the working group members evaluating the hypothesis into a one-man show, bringing to light the frictions of thinking that occur when sciences get up on stage. It is the very ambiguous relationship of <em>Matters<\/em> with reenactment and science fiction that brings me back to the overwhelming reflections that struck Duncan and I in the subdued atmosphere of the room where we were watching our guide\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n<p>When writing <em>Matters,<\/em> both Duncan and I realized we had to stick to the Anthropocene\u2019s dominant scientific and political narrative in order to be coherent with the discourses of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/anthropocene-working-group\">Anthropocene Working Group<\/a>\u2019s inaugural meeting. Including what we clumsily named \u201calternative stories to the main Anthropocene narrative\u201d would have given them the status of mere commentaries next to the dominant one. Yet, in my view, ecological thought starts by exploring both the dominant and the alternative in a symmetrical manner. Thus <em>Matters <\/em>became an introduction to the geological hypothesis, rather than an experimentation with the plurality of other possible worlds and temporalities that humanist, artistic, and critical accounts of the conceptual version of the notion imply. To accomplish the latter, we needed more experience and encounters. The <em>Mississippi. An Anthropocene River<\/em> journey, by aiming \u201cto make the Mississippi River basin legible as a zone of ecological, historical, and social interaction between humans and the environment using novel forms of exchange, research, collaboration, and pedagogy,\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>\u201cMississippi. An Anthropocene River\u201d: <a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/\">https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/<\/a><\/span><\/span> seemed like an inspiring opportunity for just that. The project situates the hypothesis in a specific territory, localized in the heart of Western modernity, bridging the gap between such a global concept as the Anthropocene and intimate experience. For Duncan and I, it also raised the problem of how to present the dynamics that occur between the actors and agents of such a territory in a theater. So we started to look at the material produced by the <em>Anthropocene River <\/em>learning experiment as our field of inquiry, while our group was in the process of trying to \u201cunderstand the river as a composite and storied space\u201d <span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><em>Anthropocene Curriculum<\/em> Berlin Project Team, \u201cIn Situ Anthropocene: Curatorial Statement\u201d: <a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/in-situ-anthropocene\">https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/\/contribution\/in-situ-anthropocene<\/a><\/span><\/span>\u2014producing a sort of double-layered research and creation project, a stratigraphic and multidisciplinary study of one another, to understand the territorial relationships of ones to the others.<\/p>\n<p>But what the encounter with our Natchez guide made me experience intimately is the sensitivity of this object-subject relationship. His work cannot be adequately reduced to an example of either \u201can alternative story to the dominant Anthropocene narrative\u201d or \u201ca composite and storied space.\u201d If I believe his reenactments are strongly connected to the ones Duncan and I wrote for <em>Matters<\/em> in terms of methodology\u2014in both cases, we are reenacting cultural institutions\u2019 archives in order to imagine alternative scenarios to our past, present, and future condition\u2014then every other aspect of our respective performances are marked by immense inequalities. The historic, economic, racial, and institutional factors that structure our individual speculative reenactments are deeply unequal. For one, they are marked by continuous exploitation and segregation. For another, European privilege is found in each of the abovementioned dimensions. Since environmental exploitation and extraction are intimately intertwined with the history of slavery and colonization, how can we avoid reproducing the same extractivist dynamics that brought us into the same room? In other words: Could I potentially be extracting my fellows from the <em>Anthropocene River <\/em>project, who are themselves extracting our Natchez host, whom I am extracting by extracting my fellows from the <em>Anthropocene River <\/em>project, exploiting each other all the way down\u2014and so in total contradiction with the very reasons that gathered us together that day? I had to dig into this overwhelming question, which obliged me to situate myself as an ecological intellectual. I felt it was flirting with the core of the research and creation process I\u2019ve engaged in over the past few years. I want to share here a short and nascent state of my inquiry through Field Station 5 with that problematic in mind.<\/p>\n<p>As I was sharing my thoughts with my friend and colleague in knowledge production analysis Jamie Allen while on a bus ride to a levee near New Orleans during the \u201cUnbound Engineering\u201d seminar a couple weeks later, he advised me to have a look at what he accurately called \u201cextractive epistemologies.\u201d I started by opening up Macarena G\u00f3mez-Barris\u2019s <em>Extractive Zone<\/em>, tracing \u201cthe political, aesthetic, and performative practices that emerge in opposition to the ruinous effects of extractive capital,\u201d the objective of which is \u201cto decolonize the Anthropocene\u201d:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My objective is to decolonize the Anthropocene by cataloguing life otherwise, or the emergent and heterogeneous forms of living that are not about destruction or mere survival within the extractive zone, but about the creation of emergent alternatives. Unlike these doomsday approaches that play with destruction scenarios on the scale of the planetary, I study at the level of submerged life worlds within Indigenous territories, while pointing to African-descendent territories and ontologies, modes of living that, even if not often perceivable, exist alongside extractive capitalism.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Macarena G\u00f3mez-Barris, <em>The Extractive Zone: Social Ecologies and Decolonial Perspectives<\/em>, Dissident Acts.

Yet, for Tuhiwai Smith, Indigenous Peoples have alternative stories to tell about this very ideal itself, causally linking scientific research to mankind\u2019s benefit:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Indigenous peoples across the world have other stories to tell which not only question the assumed nature of those ideals and the practices they generated, but also serve to tell an alternative story: the history of Western research through the eyes of the colonized. [\u2026] From some indigenous perspectives the gathering of information by scientists was as random, ad hoc and damaging as that undertaken by amateurs. There was no difference, from these perspectives, between \u201creal\u201d or scientific research and any other visits by inquisitive and acquisitive strangers.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Linda Tuhiwai Smith, <em>Decolonizing Methodologies<\/em>, p. 3.<\/span><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Remember our Natchez guide\u2019s answer to how undergraduate students, artists, social scientists, and curators could help him to excavate alternative stories? It was with material support. He does not need theater makers or even postcolonial theorists to translate his reenactments into contemporary art or academic idioms. He can\u2014and already does\u2014tell his stories about, with, and for African Americans, as well as to the greater public, alone. What he does need, though, is to be offered symmetrical institutional and financial opportunities as our group received in order to pursue and disseminate his work at the same scale. He needs public funds for collection building and the conservation of the Natchez Museum of African American History and Culture\u2019s archives, he needs time and space to rehearse, he needs cultural sites to invite him and his colleagues to perform their pieces. To consider him in a nonextractive way is to work with him, not to process his story as mere data.<\/p>\n<p>While discussing these matters with Bernd Scherer, the director of HKW, I asked him about the relationship of the <em>Mississippi. An Anthropocene River <\/em>project to the institution\u2019s curatorial history. He explained that the project is looking at a topographic case of the Anthropocene by working with people along the course of the Mississippi River to address issues directly related to the geological hypothesis but that are not necessarily framed in this context. The project links different kinds of initiatives as a way for each to mutually relate to their respective contexts and to develop and support their social and political agendas. He told me that one reason for going to the American South is that the Upper Delta region, specifically, contradicts the old cardinal categories of \u201cthe North\u201d and \u201cthe South.\u201d It is a way for Westerners (in this case, Westerners from Europe, so Easterners for Mississippians) to inquire both about themselves and about themselves in relation to the others. To Scherer, Louisiana, for instance, is a place where the North colonizes itself by fully exploiting its own land and people. So yes, the <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em> was about auto-colonization. When I shared with him my extractive epistemology problematic, he answered:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think if you call wherever you go and are engaging with, or just looking at a certain situation, \u201cextracting,\u201d then maybe the concept is being overused. It depends what your attitude is, the way you are engaged on the ground. The whole project was developed in a way that engaged with people we knew for quite some time. We knew their concerns and they knew ours. It is not a project that is only taking out\u2014it is also giving. Quite a number of initiatives were developed by people directly on the ground. We did not just take things and not give it back.

By taking this approach seriously it is possible to introduce communities and people who may have had little formal schooling to a wider world, a world which includes people who think just like them, who share in their struggles and dreams and who voice their concerns in similar sorts of ways. To assume in advance that people will not be interested in, or will not understand, the deeper issues is arrogant.

After this brief reflection, I believe that, as a highly educated European researcher, I write from the vantage point of the colonial world. And maybe it is only after acknowledging this position that I can try to decolonize my methodologies, rather than by trying to hide what is glaringly evident. Following the brief encounters that I have described here, some premises for such reparation emerge, such as building long-term networks to facilitate the production and transmission of alternative stories. Are the curatorial politics of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt part of this long-term knowledge sharing? And as an aspiring ecological researcher and writer analyzing Anthropocenic histories through experiences such as the Mississippi River Journey, am I taking enough care to prevent my work from falling into the extractive tendency of the pursuit of knowledge? To tell alternative stories to the dominant Anthropocene narrative is to start by acknowledging that these stories are already being told, and acknowledging the need of those who tell them for knowledge reparation.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":15658,"post_author":"12","post_date":"2019-11-21 08:51:51","post_date_gmt":"2019-11-21 07:51:51","post_content":"","post_title":"Cl\u00e9mence Hall\u00e9","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"clemence-halle","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-07-04 13:00:46","post_modified_gmt":"2020-07-04 11:00:46","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=15658","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/clemence-halle\/","acf":{"first_name":"Cl\u00e9mence","last_name":"Halle"}},{"ID":12133,"post_author":"12","post_date":"2019-09-23 10:56:11","post_date_gmt":"2019-09-23 08:56:11","post_content":"","post_title":"Temporary continent.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"temporary-continent","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-10-28 13:53:16","post_modified_gmt":"2019-10-28 12:53:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=12133","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/temporary-continent\/","acf":{"first_name":"","last_name":"Temporary continent.
