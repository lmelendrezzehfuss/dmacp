What does it hold, in terms of revolutions similar to the one we are facing now? What maps, diagrams, imagery did the deep past produce and how does it resurface in the Anthropocene? Can we imagine that the Anthropocene will cease? What is this exit like? Has anybody imag(in)ed what the return to a non-Anthropocene state would be?<\/p>\n<p>The temporal designation of the Anthropocene sits solidly on a perpetually expanding threshold subject to disciplinary, cultural, and personal persuasions. As the shape of time itself (points, lines, spirals, circles, waves, spheres) can be considered a cultural construct, we assumed time\u2019s conceptual flexibility as a basic element of our investigation. In order to then take some measure of time and visually proclaim \u201cThis not that is the Anthropocene!\u201d we worked not only to conceive of ways to distinguish certain bits of time from others, but to communicate across spatiotemporal frameworks. Thus, the particular media of delivery became every bit as important as the content of the message. From this new frame of reference, the question became: From goo as amorphous as time, through media as diverse as human experience, is there a way of actively constructing images that could reflexively communicate through deep expanses of time?<\/p>\n<p>The seminar investigation, although it touched on many more subjects, focused primarily on three potential products: fossils, hands, and holograms.<\/p>\n<h1>Fossils<\/h1>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Hyr12l29RPHGMCN6zHqsG\">\n<div class=\"font-serif width-wide text-left columns-2\">\n<p>If deep-time communication is the goal, fossils are obvious tools. Intentional fossils could be stratigraphic love notes, buried in a place for some future human(?) to find. If we were to fossilize one specific object to mark this exact moment, what would it be? Should it be a symbolic object newly created for the occasion, or an extant monument\u2014something we would miss? Although certain technological objects embody significant cultural shifts in the patterns of everyday life (i.e. Oldowan handaxe, car, smartphone), we have no inherent mechanism for conveying the objects\u2019 meaning on geological timescales; it dwarfs our faculties for foresight. Considering our role as the active authors of the story, a defining image of today\u2019s Anthropocene would resituate our entire species as animals with a capacity for deep-time communication. Using the fossil as a participatory medium, we can begin to exercise and develop that capacity. A DIY guide to fossilization would allow the independent and continuous preservation of \u201cnew\u201d objects, actually crowdsourcing the intentional population of layers of Earth with meaningful materials as markers of our growth. We make technological evolution itself a living record, and encourage temporal literacy; there is joy in the technofossil!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h1>Holograms<\/h1>\n<p>A hologram is a dynamic system made static. The hologram simultaneously employs multiple points of view to activate a single entity\u2014be it an object, an image, or an idea. In order to engage explicitly multiplicity as inherent to the human condition, the idea of a holographic reality was central to our investigations. Collective cosmologies, fictions, stories, and imaginaries have validity, not only within the culture that creates them, but also in how one\u2019s perspectives relate to those of others. From this assumption, we attempted to engage \u201cImaging the Anthropocene\u201d by assembling conflicting projections of our universe into a single, holographic map. By overlaying distinct ideas of reality in one space\u2014imagine braiding strands of scientific theories, holy books, and spiritual rites together\u2014points of view converge to form a unified image of a collective humanity. The hypothetical \u201cimage\u201d is compelling as a goal, considering the complementary roles of spiritualities, technological evolution, and storytelling in our relationship[s] to the world around us. Since human experience is constantly evolving, new \u201clayers\u201d are being generated constantly and thus the map will never be complete. But in the end, a holographic map of the universe may be a more beautiful image if left in the mind. After all, as we are in the midst of acknowledging our role in the transformation of the Earth, the designation of the Anthropocene either is super-optimistic, supposing that we last long enough to define an epoch, or heartbreakingly negative.<\/p>\n<h3>WHEN ARE WE? T-SHIRT<\/h3>\n<p>As we moved deeper and deeper into the fraught territories of universal humanity, we decided to ask a question because an answer seemed impossible. \u201cWhen are we?\u201d is a provocation. The question evokes an atmosphere of temporal confusion, as if being introduced to the Anthropocene is akin to crash-landing in a foreign time. It is a slogan conceived as a tool to allow atomized conversations to supersede our small group and engage multiple publics. By making it wearable, we make the wearer a docent and allow each individual who reads it to engage, subsequently reflecting and developing a unique position. If we are declaring a new period in Earth\u2019s history, we must ask the essential question: \u201cWhen are we?\u201d<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":21655,"id":21655,"title":"hasselhoff","filename":"hasselhoff.jpg","filesize":211813,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/times-before-and-after\/hasselhoff\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"","caption":"","name":"hasselhoff","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":21648,"date":"2020-03-24 15:27:50","modified":"2020-03-24 15:27:50","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":674,"height":800,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff-647x768.jpg","thumbnail-width":647,"thumbnail-height":768,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff-253x300.jpg","medium-width":253,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff.jpg","medium_large-width":674,"medium_large-height":800,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff.jpg","large-width":674,"large-height":800,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff.jpg","1536x1536-width":674,"1536x1536-height":800,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff.jpg","2048x2048-width":674,"2048x2048-height":800,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/hasselhoff.jpg","feature-width":674,"feature-height":800}}]}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3019,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:10","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:10","post_content":"","post_title":"Christopher Reznich","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"christopher-reznich","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:12:23","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:12:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/christopher-reznich\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/christopher-reznich\/","acf":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Reznich"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20733,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:57:12","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:57:12","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene remains peculiarly flat and colorless when it comes to concrete images, which are lacking cultural nuance and historical depth.

Today it presents itself in scientific images as planetary boundaries and limits to growth, as an age when human interventions on the planet call for a great transformation. But in a much wider sense, transformation, utopia, collapse and ambition, reflection and bewilderment have long been topics of human relationships with the landscape, large and small. This can be seen in works of art as well as in science: images of landscapes, or indeed the entire Earth, express topics of metamorphosis, of power, economy, security, and appropriation. They also express fantasies about the wild, the other\u2014and about possible alternatives to present-day ways of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of the seminar was to explore existing images of the Earth and the Anthropocene, and to extend the scope further to include imaginaries of alternative futures. Participants engaged with ways in which a transformed, warmer, less stable, highly utilized world might see changes in social patterns, ways of life, and culture that go much deeper than what is commonly discussed. Exploratory, imaginary engagement with anthropogenically altered landscapes in a possible future presented sharp new perspectives on the Anthropocene and its implications in areas such as architecture and art.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Imaging the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-14 18:23:57","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-14 16:23:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20733","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":23593,"id":23593,"title":"HKW_Imaging the Anthropocene","filename":"HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","filesize":327981,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\/hkw_maging-the-anthropocene\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_maging-the-anthropocene","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20733,"date":"2020-04-02 15:55:34","modified":"2020-04-02 15:57:00","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1589,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-768x477.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":477,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-300x186.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":186,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-768x477.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":477,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1400x869.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":869,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1536x953.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":953,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1271,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1600x993.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":993}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene remains peculiarly flat and colorless when it comes to concrete images, which are lacking cultural nuance and historical depth.
