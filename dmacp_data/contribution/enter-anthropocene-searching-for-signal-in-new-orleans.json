Scientists can look at the stratigraphy of rock record and ascertain a great wealth of information about the history of our planet, but any single outcrop or section of layers will not tell the complete story. Subtle nuances and great unconformities exist between the rocks from one location to the next. Never discouraged, geologists at the <a href=\"http:\/\/stratigraphy.org\/\">International Commission on Stratigraphy<\/a> (ICS) have managed to come together and agree on distinguishable boundaries to differentiate geologic periods, epochs, and ages. The reference boundary is referred to as the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point or <a href=\"https:\/\/simple.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GSSP\">GSSP<\/a>. This point and associated stratigraphy is what becomes globally recognized as the lower marker of a given geologic time division.<\/p>\n<p>In the dynamic times that we live in, the planet has been rapidly transformed by human activity. These changes are significant enough that the people tasked with studying the layers of the earth\u2014the ICS and the <a href=\"http:\/\/quaternary.stratigraphy.org\/\">Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy<\/a> (SQS)\u2014created a working group to debate whether these changes signify the boundary of a new geologic time period: the Anthropocene. The folks tasked with debating the Anthropocene are known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/quaternary.stratigraphy.org\/working-groups\/anthropocene\/\">Anthropocene Working Group<\/a> (AWG).

In particular, the presence of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plutonium-239\">plutonium-239<\/a> following atmospheric bomb testing around 1952 seems to be the most globally recognizable primary marker and is favored by the group.

Indeed, there are many other stratigraphic markers dated long before the plutonium-239\u2014such as evidence of human agricultural activity in the soil record\u2014that could also be used as indicators of the Anthropocene. However, the geochronological basis for the GSSP was decided by majority vote in 2016 and so the debate is secondary to the current work of the group deciding the most representative candidate site for the Anthropocene.

An Anthropocene River<\/em> and its research procession. Landmasses, carved out by margins, borders, and rifts, are understood to be provisional and fleeting\u2014continents, but temporary\u2014be they political, social, or tectonic. The project creates varied tributaries of contributions, reflections, and media arising through a collaboration between two experimental publishing collectives, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.continentcontinent.cc\/index.php\/continent\/index\"><em>continent<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em> and <a href=\"http:\/\/temporaryartreview.com\/\">Temporary Art Review<\/a>, both concerned with the amplification, modulation, and circulation of community voices on both sides of the Atlantic, and beyond.<\/p>\n <p>The <em>Mississippi. An Anthropocene River<\/em> project is bookended by two American locales:\u00a0Lake Itasca, the source or headwaters of the Mississippi River, and New Orleans, lying about one hundred river-miles upstream of the river\u2019s mouth in the Gulf of Mexico. Between these points of origin and emanation, a range of activities and perspectives precipitate via the activities and activators at the field stations of <em>Mississippi. An Anthropocene River<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Temporary<em> continent.<\/em> initiates encounters, interviews, and media collection as the route is traversed.<\/p>\n<p>Flanking the river journey by engaging online and off with field stations along the way, from north to south and \u201csource\u201d and \u201cmouth,\u201d the project gathers materials, face-to-face exchanges, and representative media as aggregated interviews and photography, audio and text. Framed as the voice of a temporary continent\u2014materially, geographically and mythically constituted\u2014the project joins the dynamic, processual, and always flowing Mississippi River, to populate an estuary of media streams evolving from a turbulent river and river project. The flows of this continental river provide tangency and connection with the field stations and participants of the <em>Anthropocene River<\/em>, collated and expanded into critical, material acts of public making.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","post_title":"Temporary
