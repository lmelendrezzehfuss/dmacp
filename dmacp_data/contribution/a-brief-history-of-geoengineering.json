It requires us to be \u201cmultidisciplinary\u201d and \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d \u2013 not to throw out deep disciplinarity, but to make better use of it, combining knowledge from diverse disciplines across the natural and social sciences, and the arts and humanities. But it also requires us to be reflexive \u2013 to be aware of the way that all forms of knowledge production are shaped by historical and social context, by instrumentation and by social practices, and can thereby make certain things visible while hiding others. The idea of the seminar was to explore these issues through diverse kinds of collaborative activity. We looked at the range of existing knowledge-skills and their relevance for the Anthropocene. What does it mean to \u201cknow\u201d something, individually or collectively? In which ways does \u201cknowing in the Anthropocene\u201d centrally involve issues of non-knowledge in all its diverse forms, including \u201cknown unknowns\u201d and the
