The term indicates the dependence of all the organisms of a community upon one another. Moreover, it links the organisms to factors of their environment, such as water temperature and salinity, and it accounts for the number of organisms of each species. M\u00f6bius witnessed this interdependence by counting more than three hundred organisms sheltered within the valves of just two oysters. This prompted him to warn the local community of fishermen and traders to consider this delicate interconnection so as not to follow the example of Cancale in France, where oyster populations were depleted by overfishing.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Karl Moebius, <em>Die Auster und die Austernwirthschaft<\/em>.

By contrast, in New Orleans, restaurants protect customers with a weakened immune system by showing them warnings associated with the consumption of oysters from the area, which can cause severe illness in some people and even death. The reason for such caution lies in the Louisiana industrial development since the beginning of the twentieth century when oil refineries were first built and started to exert environmental, selective pressures on microorganisms\u2019 metabolism to eventually contribute to the rise of antibiotic resistance.<\/p>\n<p>The key dynamics explaining the different role played by French oysters during the nineteenth century compared with oysters currently being fished in the Gulf of Mexico relates to selective pressures imposed by the industry at the microscopic scale. Specifically, this affects bacteria, which have delicate and highly dynamic equilibria, and are thus extremely sensitive to external conditions. Most importantly, since bacteria are necessary for all living beings to develop and survive, and since they can rapidly communicate to each other, their status directly impacts human health. Lateral gene transfer (aka horizontal gene transfer), which is the molecular, evolutionary mechanism allowing a rapid \u201ccommunication\u201d across bacteria and between bacteria and viruses, and which explains antibiotic resistance, has been studied for almost seventy years and is the biological hallmark of the Anthropocene.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Michael R.

These bacteria are resistant to most, if not all, currently known antibiotics.<\/p>\n<p>In countries like the USA, this health emergency is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths every year and for hundreds of thousands of sick individuals. Antibiotic resistance takes place in hospitals, where patients, doctors and nurses are in the midst of a planetary, environmental issue and is it this group to whom blame is often erroneously attributed. The real causes are in fact an entanglement of environmental factors that derive from the commodification of territories occupied by petrochemical refineries, livestock farming, and intensive agriculture, all of which is enhanced by supply chain systems.

In ten hours, a small colony of one million bacteria can produce around three hundred genetic mutations. At a different temporal scale, the selective pressure of the industry that elicits bacterial mutations has been taking place for the past hundred years or so, beginning when the first products of oil refineries were introduced in the environment. This intertwining of different bacterial and industrial rhythms causes an exponential leap, one in which millions of bacterial mutations foment the planetary emergency of antibiotic resistance, which slowly kills many hundreds of thousands of people every year\u2014without even counting those living in the Global South who are not represented by censuses undertaken by international organizations.<\/p>\n<p>An additional difficulty arises from the fact that the causes of antibiotic resistance are typically rooted in activities whose dynamics follow non-linear pathways with downstream flows that are difficult to unravel. Moreover, grassroots movements, which often push public institutions and regulatory agencies to consider and address issues of public health in Louisiana are focused on other major health threats. For example, grassroots movements such as Cancer Alley, the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN), and the Concerned Citizens of St. John concentrate their forces upon negotiating with public institutions, experts, and petrochemical corporations about the environmental, geographically circumscribed conditions causing many individuals in the region to develop cancer, asthma and other health issues.<\/p>\n<p>Antibiotic resistance in the New Orleans area and southeast Louisiana is in fact a geographically dispersed process that concerns some 3,700 kilometers of river and multiple sites of origins. Even if antibiotic resistance is mainly recorded in hospitals, its roots lie in several locations, some of them thousands of kilometers away from the problem\u2019s acme. Therefore, the geographically situated dimension of pollutants that cause the ill health of local communities and which shape the identity and practices of grassroots movements, gets lost in the geographically scattered dimension of antibiotic resistance. The long journey of the Mississippi River is a major challenge when attempting to track and control causes of antibiotic resistance, as in its course it gathers the chemical outputs of ten states, which then end up in the dead zone of the Mississippi River Delta\u2014where the superbugs flourish.<\/p>\n<p>In the short and medium-term, the endeavors of biomedical research and its translation (from lab bench to bedside) represent an effective, biomedical form of help for patients infected by antibiotic-resistant bacteria\u2014through the discovery of new antibiotics, for instance. However, bacterial dynamics are so fast and ineffable that both precise prediction and interventions against bacterial resistance are doomed to failure. To put it another way: in the long run, industrial pollution needs to be considered as a factor that will always elicit the resistance of bacteria. A worthy social, scientific and political challenge to seriously consider the historical and biological trajectories of antibiotic resistance therefore requires an appreciation of bacterial dynamics as key, elemental processes necessary for the flourishing of all individuals and communities of animals and plants and that, at the same time, constrain human societies to both nature and industrial development. This is a challenge that calls for a change of political and scientific regimes of blind industrialization, demanding that they instead consider nature as partner.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":21537,"post_author":"12","post_date":"2020-03-23 12:07:20","post_date_gmt":"2020-03-23 11:07:20","post_content":"","post_title":"Flavio D\u2019Abramo","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"flavio-dabramo","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-23 16:03:21","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-23 15:03:21","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=21537","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/flavio-dabramo\/","acf":{"first_name":"Flavio","last_name":"D\u2019Abramo"}}],"projects":false,"methods":[{"term_id":5,"name":"Case Study","slug":"case-study","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":5,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":130,"filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":6,"name":"Modeling","slug":"modeling","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":6,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":17,"filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":10,"name":"Field Work","slug":"field-work","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":10,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":150,"filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"keywords":[{"term_id":183,"name":"Biosphere","slug":"biosphere","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":183,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":23,"filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":282,"name":"Water","slug":"water","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":282,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":77,"filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":250,"name":"Pollution","slug":"pollution","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":250,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":30,"filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":264,"name":"Species","slug":"species","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":264,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"folksonomy":false,"location":{"address":"New Orleans, LA, USA","lat":29.95106579999999,"lng":-90.0715323,"zoom":7,"place_id":"ChIJZYIRslSkIIYRtNMiXuhbBts","name":"New Orleans","city":"New Orleans","state":"Louisiana","state_short":"LA","country":"United States","country_short":"US"},"publish_to_dat":false},"author_name":"fiona.shipwright","project_parents":[{"id":21538,"title":"Oysters, Selective Pressures, and Antibiotic Resistance in the Mississippi Delta","post_title":"Oysters, Selective Pressures, and Antibiotic Resistance in the Mississippi Delta","slug":"oysters-selective-pressures-and-antibiotic-resistance-in-the-mississippi-delta","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/oysters-selective-pressures-and-antibiotic-resistance-in-the-mississippi-delta\/","post_type":"contribution"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/contribution\/21538"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/contribution"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/contribution"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/12"}],"version-history":[{"count":35,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/contribution\/21538\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25977,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/contribution\/21538\/revisions\/25977"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=21538"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=21538"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=21538"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=21538"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
