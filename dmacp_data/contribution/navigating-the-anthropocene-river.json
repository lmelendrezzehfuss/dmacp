These life-affirming and meaningful experiences are much needed in the midst of the generally grim realities of the present era, made all the more daunting now by COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, this is an exploration of the (dis)comforts of what could be called being at home-in-the-world. This is both a radical rethinking of the praxis of higher education and a pedagogical form that allows for a nuanced, balanced, and complex understanding of the Anthropocene. This notion is explored via the example of the River Semester, a hundred-day canoe journey down the Mississippi River in 2015 and 2018 (with the next trip planned for 2021). A custom form of this expedition, organized in partnership with the <em>Haus der Kulturen der Welt<\/em> and Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, took place in Fall 2019 under the title of the \u201cAnthropocene River Journey.\u201d These programs were conceived as lived experiments and performative acts of rebellion against existing practices in higher education and as correctives for the resource-intensive norms of modern Western consumer capitalism. An Anthropocene curriculum needs to provide opportunities for the life-affirming communal experiences and connections with what remains \u201cnatural\u201d in the Anthropocene. We have found these experiences to provide students with the skills and mindset needed for the long journey ahead and to be powerful medicine for the anxieties, anomie, and dysfunctions of our day.<\/p>\n<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\n<p>In these precarious times\u2014variously referred to as the Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Chthulucene, climate change, the Great Acceleration\u2014those attuned to the realities of the global dynamics and trends, and called to respond to them, face a daunting set of challenges, stresses, and psychological strains. Maintaining hope, a sense of purpose, health, and sanity in the midst of the Sixth Extinction, rising sea levels, catastrophic floods and fires, resurgent xenophobic populist nationalism, and global pandemics is no small feat. Teaching and learning in this context require a curriculum that engages with these difficult and complex realities and also an intentionality around the ways to inspire hope and the sense of agency needed for the work that will inevitably be required to navigate the (literal and metaphorical) storms that lie ahead.<\/p>\n<p>As Alya Ansari, one of the participants in planning workshops for the Anthropocene River project, <a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/evolving-epistemologies-knowing-about-along-the-mississippi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">puts it<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Anthropocene has raised more questions and uncertainty about the ways in which we live and know than it has delineated a clear, forward course of action. What does it mean, concretely, to do the kind of comprehensive reformation of knowledge production that the Anthropocene calls for and enables? How do we resist within the Anthropocene, and how do we use the agency the concept bestows upon us to grapple with the harsh realities of a world we have created?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These canoe-based, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.augsburg.edu\/river\/\">semester-long expeditions<\/a> down the Mississippi River, by their very nature, entail a thorough exposure to and immersion in the social, political, and anthropocenic realities of life in the American heartland. Stripped of the protections and comforts of life indoors and away from the screen-dominated (ir)realities of the digital age, the travelers on these journeys come face to face with the industry, poverty, wealth, wilderness, pollution, beauty, injustices, vitality, and dysfunction of natural and human communities all along the river.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Joseph Underhill, \u201cWhat We Learned from the River,\u201d <em>Open Rivers<\/em>, no. 6 (Spring 2017): <a href=\"https:\/\/editions.lib.umn.edu\/openrivers\/article\/what-we-learned-from-the-river\/\">https:\/\/editions.lib.umn.edu\/openrivers\/article\/what-we-learned-from-the-river\/<\/a><\/span><\/span> The students on these trips face the rigors of paddling hundreds of miles on a major river in all kinds of weather and attend to the duties and needs of the expedition, all while taking a full load of college credits.

Photo documentation and field notes are inserted as illustrations of points raised in the text, and also as standalone vignettes that capture moments and sites that stood out for the river travelers.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most notable elements of these journeys is that they are much more than the standard educational endeavors of research and knowledge acquisition. At many points along the way, participants have broken down and wept. This journey through the Anthropocene is emotionally laden and requires us to move from the cerebral and more narrowly academic concerns to our hearts and bodies and to notions of self-care, health, joy, and thriving. A central question raised by the experience of an extended, mostly human-powered voyage through an anthropocenic space is what the sustainability of those efforts is, in personal and emotional terms. In other words, how can we <em>live<\/em> and find joy in the midst of such immersion in the challenges and stresses of the Anthropocene?<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27208,"id":27208,"title":"JUnderhill2","filename":"JUnderhill2.jpeg","filesize":485315,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2.jpeg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/junderhill2\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/notes.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/id\/11141\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Field Note<\/a> by Joe Underhill","caption":"These heroin syringes, found scattered near urban camps in Minneapolis, are but one vivid indicator of the pain and desperation of our times.","name":"junderhill2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-07-23 14:40:22","modified":"2020-07-24 08:59:21","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1050,"height":1400,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2-576x768.jpeg","thumbnail-width":576,"thumbnail-height":768,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2-225x300.jpeg","medium-width":225,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2-768x1024.jpeg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":1024,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2.jpeg","large-width":1050,"large-height":1400,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2.jpeg","1536x1536-width":1050,"1536x1536-height":1400,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2.jpeg","2048x2048-width":1050,"2048x2048-height":1400,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2-48x48.jpeg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill2-900x1200.jpeg","feature-width":900,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>The historical and intergenerational trauma and solastalgia (sense of environmental loss) caused by the displacements and genocides of settler colonialism, slavery, racism, lynchings, war after war after war, pollution, the loss of beauty, the clusters of cancer in communities of color, constitute a challenge to the human spirit and contribute to the increase in stresses and mental illness nationally.

Minneapolis: Milkweed, 2015.<\/span><\/span>This amounts to finding a home in the midst of all this chaos\u2014a place of refuge, a sense of belonging and community, a connection to place, and a space within which we can thrive and be creative. We might call such a space a home-in-the-world. It is a way of living in the Anthropocene that allows us to engage with the realities and challenges of our day, minimize our environmental impact, and maintain a sense of agency. Each person experienced the journey differently. During these various river journeys, many participants at times did feel overwhelmed, anxious, frightened, or ready to call it quits. But at many points during our river journeys, we also felt decidedly at home on the river. We experienced joy there\u2014living simply, with far less of the material possessions that separate us from the world, slowing down, using our bodies to do the daily paddling and setting up camp, sitting around the fire, to swim in the water, to experience a sense of reverential belonging, of grace. One such moment happened as we paddled through a thick swath of wild rice, when two Ojibwe rice-harvesting canoes silently emerged, quietly pushed along by men with long poles. There was a brief greeting, then a return back into the rice marsh, the boats swallowed up and disappearing into the tall grass. This display of connection and harmonious relationship with the land was inspiring, and reflected a certain hunger for that kind of connection among our group of river travelers.<\/p>\n<p>A central element to the notion of home-in-the-world is the spiritual and ritual or ceremonial aspects of that space. Under the vastness of the sky and immersed in the unknowable mysteries and deeply troubling realities of the world, the river travelers instinctively moved toward\u2014hungered for\u2014the comfort afforded by ritual and ceremony. This longing for a sense of connection and meaning affirmed the importance of the journey as a pilgrimage, not toward the otherworldly redemption of a Christian heaven but toward deeper connections to the world, to each other, and to the sublime. In all this, the <em>mysterium mysteriorum<\/em> was the gigantic, majestic, magical entity of the Mississippi River itself. Each time we returned to the river, it was, as in the words of the traditional spiritual, like we were \u201cgoing down in the river to pray.\u201d Each time we swam in its waters, we were being baptized. The river at various times healed us, frightened us, washed away our sweat and our sins, and steadily carried us along toward the sea. In the midst of the relentless reminders of the damage wrought by the capital-industrial-military complex, the palpable constant of the river\u2019s flow was calming. Despite all efforts to control it, to use it as a sewer and a dumping ground or a highway, the river has not been stopped or killed.

The odyssey constitutes a kind of \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/bunyanministries.org\/books\/pp_full_text.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pilgrim\u2019s progress<\/a>\u201d through the Anthropocene, with hints of a way forward\u2014not <em>out of<\/em> the Anthropocene but <em>into<\/em> a way of finding a home within it. At points along the way, the journeys have included encounters and conversations with river elders and other local guides who have provided insights that hint at what came before, what has been lost, and what might yet be possible again. Most of the river and watershed are heavily industrialized and engineered, but scattered throughout the journeys are also signs of resilience, agency, and hope. Being out on the river can often be discouraging. But it can also provide evidence of the strength and vitality of the river, and of the natural world in general. In spending an extended period of time on the Mississippi, we are reminded of the basic truth that the world is always more complicated than it is made out to be in any given abstract representation of it.<\/p>\n<p>Although the dynamics and processes of the Anthropocene seem to engulf us, the colonization of the river is not complete. There are guides and mentors along the way\u2014Indigenous voices, women artist-activists, river angels, river rats\u2014who offer wisdom and perspective on our journey through the mixed dystopic, pastoral, and thoroughly anthropocenic landscape. At the beginning of our journey as part of the <em>Anthropocene Curriculum<\/em>, for instance, we met with Shanai Matteson and Graci Horne, who helped to orient us to the headwaters and Indigenous history of the Upper Mississippi. Horne, a Lakota\/Dakota artist-activist, shared with us four questions used in her community to introduce oneself to a group: Who am I? Where am I? Who are my people? and What are my intentions? Her challenge to us was to critically reflect on our presence and roles within this settler-colonial space. Simple as they were, these questions challenged us and stayed with us throughout the journey, helping to ground us in place and in community with each other and with the people we met along the way. She likewise spoke of the river as a \u201cTree of Life\u201d in the middle of Turtle Island (the Indigenous name for the North American Continent), and our group would come to see the river and watershed as a source of life force and spiritual sustenance along the journey. Horne invited us to think about those Indigenous lives that were lost, and continue to be lost, on and along the river, and to give tobacco in offering to them as we went (which we did on a few occasions). The challenge presented to us at the start of our journey was how to acknowledge and constructively engage with this history as a group of mostly white, affluent academics.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27211,"id":27211,"title":"JUnderhill5","filename":"JUnderhill5.jpg","filesize":146905,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/junderhill5\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/notes.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/id\/5493\">Field Note<\/a> by John Kim","caption":"Graci Horne, her daughter, and Shanai Matteson at the pre-trip orientation at the Wilderness Inquiry headquarters, Minneapolis.","name":"junderhill5","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-07-23 14:40:28","modified":"2020-07-24 09:15:03","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1400,"height":1050,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5-768x576.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":576,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5-300x225.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":225,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5-768x576.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":576,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":1050,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5.jpg","1536x1536-width":1400,"1536x1536-height":1050,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5.jpg","2048x2048-width":1400,"2048x2048-height":1050,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill5.jpg","feature-width":1400,"feature-height":1050}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>At the Mississippi headwaters, the landscape provided some sense of the premodern possibilities, in the land (in Dakota, <em>Makoce<\/em>) where the waters (<em>Mni<\/em>) reflect the sky (<em>Sota<\/em>), and our group formally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/land-acknowledgement-statement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acknowledged that we were on Indigenous land<\/a>.

we left the headwaters and proceeded downstream Upper Mississippi (between the Twin Cities and St. Louis), our time on the Mississippi River repeatedly confirmed that we live in an era of grave social and ecological challenge. To help bring about the historically unprecedented economic and social transformations called for by these challenges, we will need something more than a curriculum that is embedded within the modern fossil-fuel-powered economy, rooted in medieval scholasticism, and structured by the narrow and atomistic structures and epistemologies of modernity. But the River Semester is one attempt at imaging such an alternative. The Anthropocene is bringing about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de\/project\/anthropocene-earth-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collapse of conceptual and disciplinary boundaries<\/a>, connecting the local and global via the technosphere, eliding nature and culture, and entangling us in \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-campus-the-human-delta\/seminar-clashing-temporalities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clashing temporalities.<\/a>\u201d Our experiences on the river reflected these complexities and entanglements.

The hybrid and liminal nature of the Anthropocene requires an increased competence in intercultural diversity and interdisciplinary thinking, as well as practical training that moves beyond the theoretical confines of the academy. The program offers action-oriented education that is localized and applied to problem-solving, resilience, and coping skills for operating in stressful, even traumatic, situations. The river journeys provide an array of opportunities to engage in this kind of learning and provides hints of what a curriculum fit for the Anthropocene might look like. These times call for ways of teaching, learning, and doing research (and living) that are commensurate with the scope of the societal transformations being wrought by the Anthropocene\u2014that is to say, what is needed is an education for systems change, not an education for learning how to function or thrive within the existing system.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27214,"id":27214,"title":"JUnderhill8","filename":"JUnderhill8.jpg","filesize":198838,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/junderhill8\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/notes.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/id\/13371\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Field Note<\/a> by Christoph Rosol","caption":"South of La Crosse, Wisconsin students and faculty getting an embodied sense of the scale and feel for the Anthropocene landscape, scrambling up a pile of sand created by the ongoing efforts of the US Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the main navigation channel of the Upper Mississippi River.","name":"junderhill8","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-07-23 14:40:36","modified":"2020-07-24 09:16:35","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1400,"height":788,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8-768x432.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":432,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8-300x169.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":169,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8-768x432.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":432,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":788,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8.jpg","1536x1536-width":1400,"1536x1536-height":788,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8.jpg","2048x2048-width":1400,"2048x2048-height":788,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill8.jpg","feature-width":1400,"feature-height":788}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>As part of what the environmental engineer Peter Haff has termed the<a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/the-technosphere-and-the-mississippi-river\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> technosphere<\/a>, the landscape we moved through has been altered in countless ways to conform to the needs of commerce, heavy industry, industrial agriculture, and urban settlement along the river. Ours was a passage through a landscape and ecosystems that have been altered on every scale\u2014from the macrolevel, evidenced in the geomorphology of the river, to the molecular, seen in the biogeochemistry of the water, soil, and air. The most immediately obvious transformations for us were the anthropocenic landscapes, such as the dredge spoils (the artificial mounds of sediment), concrete revetments (riverbank reinforcement), energy production and industrial sites encountered along the way. These forms of human alteration stand in contrast to the unstoppable flow of the river and the ongoing battle between the transportation and industrial infrastructures (constructed primarily by the US Army Corps of Engineers) and the natural hydrology of the Mississippi. The dredge piles were the work both of the river (constantly transporting and depositing sediment along its path) and the engineer corps, endlessly scooping sediment out of the river in a Sisyphean attempt to maintain the nine-foot navigational channel of the Upper Mississippi.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27215,"id":27215,"title":"JUnderhill9","filename":"JUnderhill9.jpeg","filesize":300044,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9.jpeg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/junderhill9\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/notes.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/id\/13160\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Field Note<\/a> by Temporary <em>continent.<\/em>","caption":"A view from the deck of a concrete barge on the heavily industrialized river in St. Louis","name":"junderhill9","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-07-23 14:40:38","modified":"2020-07-24 09:16:50","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1400,"height":1333,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9-768x731.jpeg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":731,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9-300x286.jpeg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":286,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9-768x731.jpeg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":731,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9.jpeg","large-width":1400,"large-height":1333,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9.jpeg","1536x1536-width":1400,"1536x1536-height":1333,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9.jpeg","2048x2048-width":1400,"2048x2048-height":1333,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9-48x48.jpeg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JUnderhill9-1260x1200.jpeg","feature-width":1260,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>The capitalist ruins, and ongoing industrial activities, along the river were likewise a steady presence during our journey.

Much of the history of modern, Western, settler-colonial capitalism can be read as the quest for greater levels of control over the world (controlling othered bodies, water, energy, food production, and capital, keeping out disease, enemy invaders, \u201cundesirable people,\u201d and so on). This system has gotten very good at creating a sense of control over its surroundings. The results are planetary dysfunction, climate change, extinctions, and personal dysfunction, depression, anxiety, and malaise. To a large degree, these systems are mirrored, replicated, and refined within the structures of higher education.<\/p>\n<p>One goal of an Anthropocene curriculum is to \u201cget outside\u201d of these structures and resource-intensive ways of being. To a degree, this means living with fewer barriers between us and the world. Such an arrangement facilitates our own awareness of and understanding of the Anthropocene in all its unpleasantness. By removing these barriers, we are brought into conversation and cohabitation with the amazing array of humans and species\u2014kin\u2014that share this planet, and, in the process, we become more fully alive. This does not mean we should or can remove all barriers\u2014the complete removal of barriers is found only in death and our complete dissolution into the world. Human life requires us to be reasonably warm (or cool) and to avoid the mosquito bites, sunburn, poison ivy rashes, and other unpleasantries that can come from life out of doors. The trick is to find that the balance between being connected to the world and being exposed to danger or great discomfort. There are always trade-offs here, but it seems clear that a large part of the Anthropocene problematic is the excess of barriers.<\/p>\n<p>An Anthropocene curriculum, then, requires some redefining of the \u201ccomforts of home,\u201d not as the sterile isolation of the modern home but as the vitality and connection found in being at home-in-the-world. To the extent that our ecological (and often social) impacts are directly tied to our comfort level, this new way of living will require giving up things, and living with less control and comfort than we have become accustomed to. Some technological fixes\u2014solar energy, electric cars, high-efficiency buildings, and so on\u2014may allow us to have our cake and eat it too. But, at least in the short term, there is no way we can reduce the total destructive impacts of the modern economy and way of life without some fairly radical shifts. We should not underestimate the political, social, and cultural difficulties of such a shift\u2014humans are generally attached to their comforts, love labor-saving devices and new gadgets, and there is a massive marketing system promoting all of this.<\/p>\n<p>The question of how much we can or should we give up came up at various points along the river trips, as we collectively faced the physical challenges and discomforts of a life that entailed a significant decrease in the control and conveniences of home-in-the-Capitalocene. For the most part, we used our own bodies for labor, with the result being a per-person carbon footprint that was a small fraction of a typical American\u2019s. We were sheltered from the elements by a few layers of clothing or our sleeping bags and the two thin layers of ripstop nylon that constituted our tents at night. We got muddy, bathed in the river, were bitten by various blood-sucking insects, and experienced at various times sunburn, straight-line winds, scattered flurries, and flash floods. As we as individuals struggled with these conditions, we had to think about how much discomfort we were willing and able to endure.<\/p>\n<p>Undertaking the River Journey is not a matter of doing penance for our extractive and overconsumptive sins (although there is inevitably an element of the morality play here). Such an experience is most constructively seen as engaging in an awareness of the true \u201ccost of living,\u201d as it includes a wide array of social and environmental impacts. It is then our responsibility to minimize these impacts and in a basic sense just clean up our messes. It is important to keep in mind that this kind of low-impact living should not be imposed on those living at the margins\u2014people for whom the exposure to the vagaries of the world is a daily reality, often with high costs. The global poor, seeking relief from the hardships of poverty, have every right to improve their standards of living and enjoy the benefits of \u201cmodern life.\u201d Those in the Global South and Indigenous and other marginalized communities within Western nations will need to find their own paths, with allyship consisting largely of the hegemonic rich white folks getting out of their way, addressing the historical injustices, and dismantling the structures that continue to do slow violence in those communities.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Rob Nixon, <em>Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor.<\/em> Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press 2013.<\/span><\/span> The issue here is not to impose strictures on the poor; it is crucial that there is agency and choice in this process of making a home-in-the-world, not some imposed hardship of poverty or displacement.

There is no one particular answer to this question, other than to say that we must cultivate an awareness of the issues and engage in an ongoing discernment of how far to push ourselves. The appropriate balance will depend on the individuals that make up a given community, and the cultural context. For our particular experience of facing the Anthropocene on the River Journey, besides the challenge of safely navigating the actual river (an inherently dangerous activity, in and of itself), we needed to travel through this landscape with a level of self-awareness about all the above-described emotional dynamics. A key dimension to the experience is the attitude and group culture with which it is approached. If the attitude is one of unrelenting pessimism and despair, the experience reflects this. Approached with some level of optimism or hope for change, the experience is markedly different.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of spending time on, and learning from, rivers, this optimistic approach amounts to aspiring toward something akin to the state of flow<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>See, <em>inter alia<\/em>, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.<\/em> New York: Harper, 2008.<\/span><\/span> or being-in-the-river, in the sense of being fully immersed in the complex and multifaceted realities of life, rather than being separated from them. On these river expeditions, such a state of flow is often the case, both literally and figuratively. Finding the balance between stagnation and exhaustion, between those things that we cannot change and those that we can, between boredom and terror, we sought a kind of Aristotelian golden mean. Not unlike the current negotiations around safe spaces and trauma on campuses and in classrooms, we need to find the right amount of challenge\u2014that is to say, a right balance to challenge our ideas and assumptions but not cause harm or trauma. In expedition language, we must try to find that space known as one\u2019s \u201cchallenge zone,\u201d which exists between the comfort zone and the panic zone.<\/p>\n<p>An embodied theory of education and life calls us to get our neurons firing, our muscles pumping, our senses alive. This idea of being \u201cfully alive\u201d is worth taking seriously, even as it ironically entails being closer to death\u2014more exposed, vulnerable, at risk in the world. If the Faustian bargain of modern consumer-extractive capitalism is that we have numbed and anesthetized ourselves, retreated to the mall and self-hypnotized ourselves in front of the digital phantasmagoria of a billion high-def screens, this journey into home-in-the-world offers an alternative where we can connect with the world and our fellow human beings, with a much greater chance of saving ourselves. This kind of \u201caliveness\u201d includes a thorough connection with and awareness of the beauty and wonder of the world, a connection to a community, a grounding in the body and the pleasures and joys that it brings\u2014and a sense of purpose and meaning in one\u2019s life. We experienced all these dimensions, at various points and to varying degrees, along the river.<\/p>\n<h1>Imagining a way home<\/h1>\n<blockquote><p><em>Can you imagine a way<br \/>\n<\/em><em>Canoe, to carry us home?<br \/>\n<\/em><em>Dig, dig into the water<br \/>\n<\/em><em>Dig, dig into the water<br \/>\n<\/em><em>Heave-e-oh!

Any number of different responses to these kinds of modern stresses can arise\u2014escapism and retreat, religion, drug use, therapy, action, humor, getting lost in abstraction.

Because, in addition to all the \u201cfuckery\u201d perpetrated by the forces of reactionary patriarchal heteronormative fossil-fueled consumer capitalist neocolonialism, there is also a great deal of life force, fierce love, and diverse resilience out there. There is the unending flow of energy from the sun, the never-ending flow of rain from the skies, the inventiveness and ongoing diversity of life forms and genetic material, and the richness of cultures that we will need in order to imagine a way home.
