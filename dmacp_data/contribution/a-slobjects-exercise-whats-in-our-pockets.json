We found a host of connections and associations by comparing two of the objects we produced: an oak gall and a square of silk. While writing about, drawing, and diagramming those relationships over the course of the workshop, we had a rich conversation around the entanglement of humans, history, ecology, and technology.<\/p>\n<p>Our conversation led us to draw out the following unifying concepts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unity and diversity of codes: ink to write, holes in Jacquard looms, punch cards and oak galls, algorithms and computers, text as stories and binary codes<\/li>\n<li>Multiscale weaving: from cellulose \ufb01ber synthesis in leaves (nanometric scale) to textile weaving (metric scale)<\/li>\n<li>The question of domestication\u2014from the domesticated silkworm to the domestication of humans via textiles and computers<\/li>\n<li>Nonhuman intelligence: plants as solar energy converters, insects as transformers and converters of plant material<\/li>\n<li>Resource use: human dependency on plants as a resource base, the cyclical tendencies of the biosphere versus the noncyclical tendencies of the technosphere<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>How to approach this exercise<\/h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Facilitator directs the group to sit in a circle around several large sheets of paper.<\/li>\n<li>Each group member empties their pockets\/purse\/backpack and selects several objects to present to the group.<\/li>\n<li>Participants introduce themselves and the objects they have selected. The facilitator leads the group in asking a series of questions about each of the objects. The facilitator takes notes on one of the pieces of paper in the center of the group (or on a whiteboard).<\/li>\n<li>Working with each other and with the facilitator, the group selects two objects to contrast and compare as a group.<\/li>\n<li>The facilitator guides the process of creating a drawing (on a fresh piece of paper, referring to the notes from step 3), combining text, objects, and lines to create a mind-map showing how the objects relate to each other, to humans, and to other lifeforms.

a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects. One such way is to focus on the development of an imaginary museum, whose galleries open up vistas for everyone seeking alternate ways to educate students and think about global change.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, global knowledge is often packaged for the \u201cfast and furious\u201d commercial media, or challenged by the democratic social media, but this module focuses on a \u201cthird way\u201d: \u201cslow media\u201d that, by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects. The idea of the Anthropocene demands thinking about a Long Now\u2014that is, not just a single human lifetime but up to seven generations, as suggested by <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/longnow.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Long Now Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To this we added the global imaginary, the Big Here: the local is now planetary in scale. An Anthropocene imaginary demands a sense of global citizenship and a consciousness on the part of an observer that includes their great-grandparents and their great-children. Having a \u201cglobal soul\u201d (to use Pico Iyer\u2019s term) and dwelling across generations stretches and stresses the human sense of self. The idea of doing such imagining at a slower pace in a physical place or with real objects, offers an alternative to the \u201csound bite\u201d approach to communicating complex ideas. One way to make the idea of slowing down concrete and accessible is through extending our understanding of the museum as a place that exhibits and preserves objects and artifacts. With the idea of an imaginary museum that holds individual objects and collections the seminar wants to offer new tools not only for people working in museums, but for everyone seeking alternative ways to educate students and citizens to think about global change and ways of living in the Anthropocene.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Slow
