Thirty years ago, when hundreds of acres of oak and hickory were slated for commercial timber harvest, Southern Illinois activists buried themselves up to their necks to block the roads. They went to court, over and over, until the tree removal was stopped. Today, these same local activists are hosting an international gathering to amplify the value of forests at a critical environmental juncture, as atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches above 400 parts per million. Diverse, thriving forests, which are one of the most powerful mitigators of atmospheric carbon, are increasingly threatened globally. Furthermore, under the Trump administration there have been draconian rollbacks to protections from air and water pollution, as well as numerous other challenges that bring the atmosphere closer to a tipping point. We\u2019re at an environmental education center near Carbondale, Illinois, and as the sun slips behind the trees, strategy sessions conclude and the 200-plus attendees straggle into a huge hall for dinner. Alongside the older folk is a new generation of activists dedicated to ending extractive economies while also building a movement that supports the construction of just relationships.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The website of the North American Forest and Climate Movement proclaims, <em>\u201cWe promote <\/em>\u00a1Buen vivir!\u2014<em>life in harmony between humans, communities, and the Earth where work is not a job to make others wealthier, but for a livelihood that is sustaining, fulfilling, and in tune with the common good.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The conveners of the North American Forest and Climate Movement Convergence are asking for no less than societal transformation. For those of us researching as part of the <em>Mississippi: An Anthropocene River <\/em>project at Confluence Ecologies (Field Station 4), it felt important to engage with this organization in solidarity and around our shared commitments to planetary health. And so, a \u201cConflurgence\u201d was born with the Asian Carp Convivial Meal. The forest folk promote <em>\u00a1Buen vivir! <\/em>and reciprocally we wanted to add <em>\u00a1Con vivir! <\/em>through a <em>convivial <\/em>engaging of the togetherness of forest and river as precarious ecologies, and of the Asian carp and humans as entangled species.<\/p>\n<p>My artist\/biologist collaborator Andy Yang and I have been mapping the social and ecological relationships between humans and Asian carp in the lower Mississippi river system, by researching fisheries policy, river engineering, commerce, and human dietary habit. We are energized by the question of what it would take for people to perceive their own watershed as a source of plentiful and nutritious food. Field Station 4 has joined this convening of activists and knowledge-givers to share a meal, and to contribute to this meal regionally grown and wild-caught fish that have been cast as an enemy species. These two varieties of Asian carp, bighead and silver, were introduced as an experiment in the biological control of algae growth in aquaculture operations. The carp efficiently cleaned up algae, but then they escaped into the rivers to become a newer \u201cweed.\u201d Although treasured as a tasty source of protein in China, bigheads and silvers get a bad rap in the US. They are bony and strange looking, and the silvers have a nasty habit of leaping out of the water, presenting a hazard to humans in boats.<\/p>\n<p>People chat in small groups, find seats for themselves at the communal tables, and then line up for a banquet-style service. The kitchen staff sets out the food. The tables are covered with our novelty printed-paper placemats that playfully share information about the fish\u2014their nutritional value (high in protein and omega-3s!) and their histories as <em>immigrants<\/em>. They ask the reader to wonder how long the fish will live in the Mississippi watershed before they lose the \u201cAsian\u201d appellation and become \u201cAmerican.\u201d We offer what one could call an \u201cencounter story\u201d and provide new descriptors for the fish: Silvery! Jumpy! Wild! Our goal is to change their reputation through an event that associates feelings of joy and conviviality with the experience of ingesting the flesh of an animal that thrives so well in local waters.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":25728,"id":25728,"title":"Sarah Lewison_Recuperative Ecology 2","filename":"Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002.jpg","filesize":276634,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/of-forests-of-rivers-and-of-meals\/confluence-at-touch-of-nature-dsc06955-002\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"","caption":"","name":"confluence-at-touch-of-nature-dsc06955-002","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":25722,"date":"2020-05-14 08:41:53","modified":"2020-05-14 08:42:24","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1440,"height":960,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002.jpg","1536x1536-width":1440,"1536x1536-height":960,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002.jpg","2048x2048-width":1440,"2048x2048-height":960,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Confluence-at-Touch-of-Nature-DSC06955-002.jpg","feature-width":1440,"feature-height":960}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>To live in harmony with the Earth means to mix our fates with that Earth, however contingent and troublesome that relationship may be.

Then cut up the butter into even walnut-sized pieces. Place butter in a thick-bottomed saucepan. A light-colored pan will help you see the browning progress. Let the pieces melt on low heat. Then turn to medium heat, and steadily stir the melted butter with a whisk or heatproof spatula. It will start to foam. Keep stirring. After 5-10 minutes, the butter liquid will turn golden brown as the milk solids sink to the bottom of the pan. Once the solids have settled and turned brown, and your liquid is golden brown, turn off the heat. The result will smell nutty and richly buttery and keeps well under refrigeration. Bring to room temperature before preparing the fish.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3310,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:34","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:34","post_content":"","post_title":"Sarah Lewison","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"sarah-lewison","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-11-05 12:18:45","post_modified_gmt":"2019-11-05 11:18:45","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/sarah-lewison\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/sarah-lewison\/","acf":{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"Lewison"}}],"projects":[{"ID":1393,"post_author":"13","post_date":"2019-08-19 14:54:58","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-19 12:54:58","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">This Field Station sets out to engage with the ecologic-economic-technological infrastructures between Kentucky and Illinois and will bring a regionally focused lens to the globally entangled Anthropocene condition.<\/p>\n  <p>As a central axis through both real and mythic America, the Mississippi designates a particularly heterogeneous space in which the natural, cultural, and historical intersect in a unique way.
