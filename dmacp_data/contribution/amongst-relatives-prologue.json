What words do we use to refer to the multi-formed beings with whom we co-exist and interrelate? Settler communities have inherited the term <em>animal<\/em>, a word often used to debase others and allocate them to an inferior position. Theorist Mel Chen writes that our understanding of animacy \u201chas the capacity to rewrite conditions of intimacy, engendering different communalisms and revising biopolitical spheres.\u201d The language we use has powerful effects on the affective and political orientation that we have towards others. Contemporary rhetorical strategies have incorporated \u201cnonhuman\u201d as a signifier of other beings. Yet even in these moves to interrupt hierarchical language, the human remains at the center.<\/p>\n<p>Written for the occasion of an experimental seminar offered in the Driftless area of southwest Wisconsin in September 2019 as part of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt\u2019s Mississippi: An Anthropocene River, this book engages with both indigenous human communities of the region and also, the region\u2019s more-than-human denizens. Developed through a series of interviews, this field guide engages ecological histories of Lakota and Ho-Chunk people: stewards and caretakers of the land I live on in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the land of the Driftless area. Throughout these interviews, our neighbor species are referred to as relatives. They are known as critical teachers, particularly important in this moment of climate change and precarious ecosystems. These understandings of kinship unsettle the western hierarchy of animacy, interrupting destructive inheritances of capitalism. As Kim TallBear (Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate) writes, \u201cindigenous peoples have never forgotten that nonhumans are agential beings engaged in social relations that profoundly shape human lives.\u201d This relational orientation found globally in indigenous communities has been written out of capitalist societies. Anti-relational orientations in capitalism undergird an extractive system finely tuned to destroy our surrounding kin \u2013 plants, insects, microbes, predators, entire ecosystems, and human communities alike.<\/p>\n<p>When I first moved to the Midwest, I lived in the homelands of the Sauk and Meskwaki in eastern Iowa \u2013 an area romanticized in the dominant American imaginary as family farms covering rolling hills. But contemporary agricultural practices and economies have carved different histories into the landscape. GMO corn is pumped full of pesticides and fertilizer as it shallowly roots in soil dead of microbial communities. The farming system is so intent on the capitalist isolation and aggrandizement of one species that the rippling effects on other species are never considered part of the equation of profit and loss. Living in an area so barren of biological diversity, whose economic and agricultural infrastructure was so intensely built on ecocide, left me questioning the ways that we (humankind) understand our relationship to other species.<\/p>\n<p>Seeking new ways of thinking about ecology, I began collecting eco-narratives from those marginalized in society, beginning with friends in my own queer community. I wanted new language for our relationships with other beings. I accumulated stories whose affect towards other species was not only relational, but also bound up in perceptions of survival. These stories foregrounded cross-species kinship amidst the dystopic realities of America as a settler colonial landscape. I hoped for my work to be a route to thinking with other species as peers, as comrades, and as teachers.<\/p>\n<p><em>Amongst Relatives<\/em> continues this work of documenting and amplifying voices of those whose relational orientation to other species is inextricably linked to survival. I recognize the indigenous knowledge shared in this field guide resists simplification, essentialization and romanticization. Instead, these interviews present an opportunity to learn the history of land that settlers occupy and the living, crucial relationships existing upon these unceded territories \u2013 territories whose future is ever contentious. These stories express lived realities connected to a long history of indigenous resistance to settler colonial encroachment. They demonstrate the ways that indigenous lives are bound to the survival of their relatives. The first interview in the field guide documents conversations with Cante Suta Francis Bettelyoun (Oglala Lakota, Oceti Sakowin), caretaker of the Native American Medicine Garden located on the University of Minnesota\u2019s campus and educator on soil, ecosystems and indigenous lifeways. The second interview presents conversations with Rhonda Funmaker and Jodee Smith, Ho-Chunk\/Anishinaabe sisters deeply invested in indigenous food traditions through catering and cooking events, foraging and community-based education.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I have been inclined to frame indigenous lifeways as rooting in resistance to capitalism. However, in these interviews I was reminded the root is elsewhere. Much of indigenous knowledge contrasts settler culture and here, we see one root is based in indigenous ethics of being a good relative. In our conversations, Bettelyoun uses the Lakota words \u201c<em>Mitakue Oyasin<\/em> \u2013 Taking care of each other, taking care of All My Relations,\u201d as a way of defining what it means to be Lakota. He shares that being a good relative is essential to being Lakota and that this kinship model includes land, water, animals, plants, and microbes as kin. Similarly, Funmaker says \u201cMost elders would say that we are supposed to watch [nature] \u2013 birds, animals, insects \u2013 and learn to live like they do,\u201c highlighting the role of multi-formed relatives as teachers.<\/p>\n<p>I come to this work as a settler descendent who has long held deep relationships to other species \u2013 a way of being in the world that often felt in conflict with how I was educated. From childhood, multi-formed kin have taught me about embodiment, land and how to survive trauma and isolation. They have reminded me that I am never alone. I am not a historian nor a philosopher nor a biologist, but I am committed to learning from the land I live on, to listen to those whose homeland I occupy, and to converse with the more-than-human species who are our co-inhabitants. I am grateful to Bettelyoun, Funmaker and Smith for their teachings, their wisdom and the opportunity to listen to, to sit with and to work with their words. These pages represent fragments of longer conversations, hours of exchange shortened to fit into one small volume. They are shared here with the knowledge that these conversations are never finished and the listening is never done.<\/p>\n<p>Read the interviews in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-2-anthropocene-drift\/field-guides-to-the-anthropocene-drift\/amongst-relatives\"><em>Field Guide 03: Amongst Relatives<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3023,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:10","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:10","post_content":"","post_title":"Corinne Teed","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"corinne-teed","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-09-12 17:43:01","post_modified_gmt":"2019-09-12 15:43:01","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/corinne-teed\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/corinne-teed\/","acf":{"first_name":"Corinne","last_name":"Teed"}}],"projects":[{"ID":590,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-09 10:26:37","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-09 08:26:37","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five introductions to responsibility for the uninvited traveller.<\/span><\/p>\n  <p>This series aims to provide readers with the contextual information necessary to become responsible uninvited guests in the <em>Anthropocene Drift<\/em>, while being nonprescriptive about the nature of that response.
