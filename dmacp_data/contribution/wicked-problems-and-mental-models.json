Almost by definition, wicked problems cannot be modeled perfectly or completely because of the many, often-conflicting perspectives on the problem itself.<\/p>\n<p>We might say that all wicked problems are complex, but not all complex problems are wicked. Natural systems, such as the physical processes manifested as the Earth\u2019s climate, are an example. Scientists may disagree about exactly how those processes work and which are the most important, while still agreeing on their character and their boundaries.<\/p>\n<p>Any problem that involves human societies brings with it the possibility, even the likelihood, of incompatible perspectives. Poverty, overpopulation, and anthropogenic climate change are obvious examples. Poverty is always relative to some point of view; people categorized as \u201cpoor\u201d in one part of the world may have standards of living far higher than poor people in another place, while some people seen as \u201cpoor\u201d by others may not even experience their own condition as one of lack or difficulty. The causes of poverty may be construed as un- or under-employment; as a result of class warfare, lack of education, racism, or deliberate repression; as an inevitable result of economic globalization; as a national, local, or personal issue; and so on. Thus, even characterizing \u201cthe problem\u201d is fraught with issues of personal, collective, and institutional stakes. Disagreement on the nature of the problem leads to conflicting ideas about its solution. As a result, few if any societies have ever eliminated poverty. Similar things can be said about any wicked problem.<\/p>\n<h2>Mental Models<\/h2>\n<p>Human beings do not, and cannot, perceive the world in its full complexity. Our perceptual systems are attuned to some kinds of stimuli but ignore others. We do not see ultraviolet light at all, though it can burn our skin. We usually notice nearby moving objects, but do not see things\u2014such as the ends of our own noses\u2014which are always present in our field of vision. Our brains simplify reality, and while we can extend our perception (with difficulty, and with assistance from instruments or from other people), we normally function with highly simplified (and skewed) versions of reality that can be called \u201cmental models.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In our workshop, we used the example of a simple doubling problem to show how these mental models often fail us. A piece of paper is about 0.1 mm thick. Fold the piece of paper in half, then in half again. Now it is 0.4 mm thick. Imagine that you fold the paper in half forty more times. How thick is it now? Do not use a calculator.<\/p>\n<p>Solving this problem engages your mental models of paper, folding, and doubling. The formula for the solution is 0.1 mm x 242\u2014yielding an answer of almost 440,000 km, greater than the distance from the Earth to the moon. In an experiment with ninety-five MIT students, none even approached the correct answer, and the same was true of our class. The example demonstrates the skewness of human beings\u2019 ability to imagine even this simple interaction of paper and doubling. It shows the need to deploy external capabilities\u2014in this case, simple mathematics\u2014to check our understanding. This is the basic principle of modeling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3263,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:30","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:30","post_content":"","post_title":"Paul N.

Applying transdisciplinary systems models to problems such as climate change or global food supply gives us useful heuristics while forcing us to think about complexity and to witness nonlinear and counterintuitive outcomes.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201cwickedness\u201d of Anthropocene concerns arises because the problems it raises are hard to formulate, for several reasons. First, such problems involve competing interests (individual, corporate, state, etc.), each of which holds a different perspective on the nature of the problem. Second, problem framing and solutions to problems are interdependent: what counts as a solution depends on how the problem is framed, and vice versa. Third, the nature of the problem, the constraints, and the available resources can change over time. Finally, efforts to solve one aspect of a wicked problem often create new, unanticipated problems. The Anthropocene is rife with examples of wicked problems. Examples include anthropogenic climate change, loss of biodiversity, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, and global food supply. Complex, interlocking feedbacks\u2014both positive and negative\u2014make such problems difficult to understand conceptually and defy simple and effective solutions. These problems also defy experimentation that could lead to a better grasp of potential solutions. The seminar focused on applying systems thinking to wicked problems, which involves gathering knowledge from many disciplines for aggregation at a higher level. Various models were used to work through solving examples of wicked problems. This facilitated a partial, somewhat abstract, but holistic grasp of problems and methods used to seek solutions that require interdisciplinary perspectives.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Modeling Wicked Problems","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-modelling-wicked-problems","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-02 18:03:54","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-02 16:03:54","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20719","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-modelling-wicked-problems\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":23600,"id":23600,"title":"HKW_Modeling Wicked Problems","filename":"HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","filesize":1954821,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-modelling-wicked-problems\/hkw_modeling-wicked-problems\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_modeling-wicked-problems","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20719,"date":"2020-04-02 15:58:24","modified":"2020-04-02 15:58:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":7810,"height":5454,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":536,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":210,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":536,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":978,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1073,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1430,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":34,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1117}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying transdisciplinary systems models to problems such as climate change or global food supply gives us useful heuristics while forcing us to think about complexity and to witness nonlinear and counterintuitive outcomes.<\/span><\/p>\n","contributors":[{"ID":3235,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:28","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:28","post_content":"","post_title":"Miriam Diamond","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"miriam-diamond","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:38:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:38:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/miriam-diamond\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/miriam-diamond\/","acf":{"first_name":"Miriam ","last_name":"Diamond"}},{"ID":3263,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:30","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:30","post_content":"","post_title":"Paul N.
