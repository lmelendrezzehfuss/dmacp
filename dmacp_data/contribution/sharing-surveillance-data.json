We need to develop operative concepts able to work across this divide, establishing \u201cfield causalities,\u201d a framework that allows us to connect individuals, environments, and artifices.<\/p>\n <p>The idea behind \u201cGeo-Politics\u201d was to challenge contemporary ways of understanding violence, because this demands a shift in explanatory models and structures of causation. From a perspective informed by an understanding of \u201cfield causalities,\u201d the analysis of armed conflict can no longer conform to the model of criminal law that seeks to trace a direct line between the two-limit figures of victim and perpetrator, or between the two ends of a smoking gun. The field is not an isolated, distinct, stand-alone object, nor is the environment a neutral background on or against which human action takes place. Rather, it is a thick fabric of lateral relations, associations, and chains of actions between material things, large environments, individuals, and collective action. It connects different physical scales and scales of action. Establishing field causalities requires the examination of force fields, causal ecologies, which are non-linear, diffused, simultaneous, and involve multiple agencies and feedback loops. Whereas linear causality entails a focus on the sequences of causal events, field causality involves the spatial arrangement of simultaneous sites, actions, and causes. Field causalities, therefore, is a useful framework for describing forms of violence that are not punctual, but rather that are slow and continuous, without clear beginning or end\u2014those which might be considered to constitute an endless war defined by the permanent clash of multiple forces.
