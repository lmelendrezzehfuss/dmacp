Marco Armiero explored the impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans, a city in the United States. The scientific perspective of the Anthropocene focuses on the fact that hurricanes are becoming more intense as the climate system warms, increasing the risk of catastrophic impacts. How people experience the impact, however, differs starkly depending on the wealth, power, and influence of different groups in New Orleans. This on-the-ground filtering greatly influenced the experiences of the residents of the city, who ranged from the wealthy who could protect their properties to the poor who lost everything, sometimes even their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Issues of power, influence, urban\u2012rural, poverty, and culture came out strongly in Amita Baviskar\u2019s scene-setter on the construction of the Sardar Sarovar gravity dam on the Narmada River in central India. The scientific filter tends to color the project favorably, because generating electricity hydroelectrically emits zero carbon dioxide and is seen as part of the solution for repairing the destabilizing climate. However, the question of who decides and who benefits from such a scheme strongly influences how various groups react to it\u2014again, it is the poorer and less powerful groups in society who suffer from even the well-meaning projects designed to deal with the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n<p>The case studies presented by the participants used various approaches to tease out how different individuals and groups across societies \u201cfilter\u201d\u2014that is, react differently to and are diversely affected by\u2014the Anthropocene. A common theme among all the case studies is that most people the world over will experience the Anthropocene as something that influences risks, constraints, and opportunities that already exist in their lives; indeed, many will be unaware that a shift in their planetary life-support system is now beginning to influence their everyday lives in a local fashion.<\/p>\n<p>Water, which is essential to life\u2014central to human cultures and livelihoods as it is to the natural world\u2014is now changing, everywhere, in very many ways, as the Anthropocene accelerates. Ice is melting, sea levels are rising, and it is raining harder more often. The patterns of liquid water across the landscapes of the planet and along the coastlines are changing. There is no better element to use than water for examining how people are filtering the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n<p>In many countries of the African continent, access to enough good-quality water has long been a challenge. The Anthropocene is exacerbating this problem in many regions. One case study focused on Lake Chad, a central feature in the livelihoods and economies of several countries that border the dwindling lake. Local and regional pressures have always been a challenge and have triggered adaptive strategies, but the new stress of diminishing rainfall in the Anthropocene is deepening this challenge.<\/p>\n<p>The Anthropocene is causing the opposite problem in the low-lying Maldive Islands south of the Indian subcontinent: too much water. Warming oceans and melting ice from far away are slowly inundating their homeland, posing an existential threat. Even here, however, filtering the Anthropocene is complex. Who is responsible for the Anthropocene? Is all of humanity to blame or only part of it? When did the Anthropocene start, and why? What is driving the Anthropocene?<\/p>\n<p>The final case study\u2014\u201cPlastic and Surrogacy\u201d\u2014is directed at the most fundamental and important features of human life: relationships and families. The technosphere, the feature of human societies that some would argue is the major driver of the Anthropocene, produces a wide range of novel entities\u2014chemicals, materials, and forms of energy that are new to the Earth system. One novel chemical type, \u201cendocrine disruptors,\u201d has the potential to wreak havoc on the human reproductive system. The implications of this are vast, and this fascinating case study is perhaps the most profound example of how we now have to filter the Anthropocene at the most fundamental level of our existence on the planet.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n"}]},"contributors":false,"projects":[{"ID":20649,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2014-11-23 14:50:13","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 13:50:13","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">The Anthropocene lens acts as a \u201cfilter\u201d: it emphasizes some elements of the socio-ecological spectrum even as it screens out certain others.

What ways of thinking and acting does the idea of the Anthropocene endorse and foster? What alternative understandings and actions does it marginalize or exclude? How does it affect different, unequally situated social groups?<\/p>\n<p>The idea of the seminar was to address these questions by examining the implications of the Anthropocene idea in different social settings and biophysical landscapes. The seminar explored how the Anthropocene concept applies to both the small-scale and the large\u2014from the local and the regional to the national and global. It analyzed how class, race, nationality, and gender affect the relative positions assigned to social groups within the Anthropocene frame. The ultimate aim was to equip participants with the tools to think carefully and critically about the concepts and methods of analysis that they deploy.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Filtering the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-filtering-the-anthropocene","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-03 17:46:39","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-03 15:46:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20649","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-filtering-the-anthropocene\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":20650,"id":20650,"title":"Benedikt Rugar_Filtering the Anthropocene","filename":"HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene.jpg","filesize":2024147,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-filtering-the-anthropocene\/hkw_filtering-the-anthropocene\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_filtering-the-anthropocene","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20649,"date":"2020-02-27 14:31:10","modified":"2020-02-27 14:36:38","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":7679,"height":4778,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-768x478.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":478,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-300x187.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":187,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-768x478.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":478,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-1400x871.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":871,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":956,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1274,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-1600x996.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":996}},"teaser_text":"<p class=\"text\">The Anthropocene lens acts as a \u201cfilter\u201d: it emphasizes some elements of the socio-ecological spectrum even as it screens out certain others.
