I think on the front end, I felt that I wanted to do this for really specific reasons: I wanted to work with you two, I thought that this could potentially be generative, it felt really important to do the work, to be thoughtful about how to do that, and if people from my own community were going to be involved, to be thoughtful about how that would look. I also felt anxiety around doing this for all the reasons you just mentioned, Monique. And then there were these varying degrees of like \u201cOh shit, and now we\u2019re going to have tour buses after all,\u201d things that I think we tried to break up. But then it happened, and we haven\u2019t really had a chance to talk about exactly what you bringing up Monique. Do you two want to talk about that a little, what felt good, what didn\u2019t? I don\u2019t know what this means going forward but I think it\u2019s worth talking about, because these kinds of activities will keep happening and what do I want my own relationship to be to it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Adam:<\/strong> When you were just talking about that, I was thinking about the nature of this enterprise over the past couple of years as being situated in these various places up and down the river and as much as the impetus was to read this river as a kind of unified body, the way that these exposure points and places reveal themselves is, I think, quite different, How we experience the Campus being located in New Orleans, I would argue, is much different to how St. Louis experienced it, or other locations upriver. So what does it mean to understand and express the specifics of place in terms of creating these points of exposure for multiple audiences participating, along with the citizens that live there?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monique:<\/strong> There\u2019s so many missed connections between up and down river\u2014the further south you go, the more disconnection there seems to be, right? I may be speaking without real understanding but it feels like that. I think that <em>all<\/em> of these places are vulnerable though. Caught between the vulnerable and desirable. The riverbank is really an uncertain territory.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monica:<\/strong> The disconnection comes out in different ways and of course you can\u2019t generalize. Several years ago I did this series of conversations by water, Skyping with people on the river in the Twin Cities on a boat and people in Louisiana down in New Orleans in a boat and we would just have a conversation. People in Louisiana were like \u201cOkay, what are you levees like? How does it work for you?\u201d And the others were like \u201cLevees? What do you mean?\u201d There was a lack of awareness of what some of the infrastructure was around the river. Because of course there are no levees in the Twin Cities in the way there are in Louisiana but there\u2019s a ton of infrastructure around the river. So again, I don\u2019t want to generalize but there\u2019s a really interesting lack of awareness. It\u2019s to do with the specifics of the place and why people are connected or disconnected; there\u2019s different reasons for that, which are interesting. That relates to what you saying, Monique, that all these places are vulnerable in some way or another, but getting into those specifics of vulnerability can tell us a lot.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":28206,"id":28206,"title":"5P5A1249","filename":"5P5A1249-scaled.jpg","filesize":918356,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1249-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/5p5a1249\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Photo

I can\u2019t help to think, as we were talking about these distinctions between relationships with the river, that it is absolutely connected to the historic uses of the river and the evolution of use of the river and the divisions of the south and the north. I think about the river here in New Orleans, and the structuring of it coming out of the plantation economy and the levees here being constructed and built by enslaved black laborers. And how that has both been obscured but also laid the foundation for the current scale of industry that is situated along the river in the south. I think about the scale at which those industries and those enterprises both historically and contemporaneously affect the relationship that people in the south have with the river. I haven\u2019t spent much time along the river in Minneapolis or further north to have a sense of the infrastructural language that exists there, but I think there are these separations and divisions of historic use, which have obviously created contemporary\u2014and vulnerabilities. These levees aren\u2019t being maintained in the way they were created, and now we have these situations where there are so many unknowns about their structural integrity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monique:<\/strong> I have to think about how the words, \u201centerprise\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure\u201d and how these intersect with \u201cimagination\u201d\u2014what humankind has made possible for commercial gain and how that ends up influencing culture in these unimaginable ways that makes this place [New Orleans] so rich. So rich and so exhausted and depleted and pillaged, in regard to just not respecting the natural intelligence of this place. I think that what our fellow journey folks really appreciated was the ability to travel through the space and I feel like we really were able to allow them to use all of their senses and to be reminded of the seen and the unseen. I don\u2019t know where we go from now. I\u2019m just feeling very exhausted and unsure what the best next steps are or what\u2019s worth investing time and energy and interest in. In us debrief what was really interesting was to see so many people wanting to have a site where folks could come to learn and be and share and experiment with something \u201cother,\u201d as a solution and a learning laboratory.

One is: in the face or the spirit of exhaustion, what would be the next best step and what would be worth spending time on? And also, back to the point integrity there\u2014I\u2019m kind of with the people who flipped off the big bus too\u2014what would we want to be different? Some of it is practical, for me, small groups for example. But is that just too simplified? What do you two think?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Adam:<\/strong> Well, \u00a0the points Monique was bringing up points about the language around the enterprise and infrastructure\u2014 I\u2019m really curious about that. But in terms of an idea situation, back about when the Campus was taking place in November, the river was at a low point, it was at its respite. There is a dissonance between an experience of the river at its lowest point of intensity and the experience of the river when it\u2019s at flood stage. There\u2019s a kind of greater awareness of certain vulnerabilities that occur like right now, as we\u2019re recording [February 2019], when the river is extremely high, very early. Ideally, if we\u2019re talking about the Mississippi River as an Anthropocene River, there needs to a full experience and expression of that I think having multiple experiences with the river, understanding its fluctuations and how it impacts our day-to-day lives and how we live on and with the river, and how this affects us and our anxieties about it\u2014I feel like that could be the flipside of the coin that\u2019s missing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monique:<\/strong> Humankind\u2019s imagination has created this infrastructure that has allowed us to believe in these artificial realities\u2014the norm of \u201cstaying dry.\u201d I think we\u2019re at a time where we\u2019re still wanting to hold onto that. Being at the bottom of the river, we know that so much that happens north of the mouth is affecting the health of the oceans. The concentration of the outfalls that happen here is contrasted with this being a place of entry, and all of the commerce that\u2019s flowing through, all the time, from all over the world. Historically you have these waves of immigration and also these waves of commodities\u2014whether it be bananas being brought up from Honduras, or medicine being developed through Tulane\u2014so they can keep the plantation workers alive. So there is that culture of commodification of whatever resources are being traded and in our modern times we have this petrochemical bonanza. We can talk about what that does for people and how they can be conditioned to think that plantation society is ok or having petrochemical industry across the street from my house is okay because, y\u2019know, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got a job. Then we can talk about how that plays out in the justification of our politics locally and also nationally as well, as well as what that means for international markets, with this trade happening on the banks. The exhaustion part comes from the fact that this little microcosm of the world that is the Mississippi Delta has so many global connections and reflections.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monica:<\/strong> It does. Which is why in the debrief the context is important because it does have so many connections and is a microcosm of so many things. That\u2019s why I feel like when we\u2019re asking people to orient towards their senses and to attune to both the seen and the unseen, when you do that, and focus on the details or what the seen and the unseen are in one location, such as in Congo Square, then that one site pulls forward the seen and the unseen and layers of the past and the present and towards the future. But it\u2019s also a microcosm and references so many other places and things globally. And maybe that\u2019s one of the reasons why, for me, at least, a site where people can be, and learn and share, and also <em>come back<\/em> becomes important. You need to ground this in something very specific, because that gives justice to an individual\u2019s experience and to very diverse levels of experience for different people. It gives justice to a place and in some ways it\u2019s the only way to get at that microcosm of a much bigger system. Otherwise it just stays an

I also think that challenges such the ferry not operating one day during the seminar and us having to be flexible\u2014that very much felt like, ok, we are living in the outfall of the Anthropocene. Whatever that might really mean, with \u201cAnthropocene\u201d having a very broad definition of course, but it relates to just to being able to survive here when we\u2019re so dependent upon there being energy that\u2019s pumping water from the Mississippi River into like a series of tanks with a bunch of chemicals that are probably produced by a bunch petrochemical processes. Or energizing materials to be used so we can have clean water that can be pumped into our homes using energy. Or just pumping the water out of the city to keep us dry. These times that we live in and just how we\u2019ve become so accustomed to being dependent upon extraction and energy and different forms of these dark processes\u2014our comfort allows complicity. And so I think again about how we were cruisin\u2019 around in our big bus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monica:<\/strong> The fact that the seminar was disrupted by the ferry not running, as Monique was saying, that all is the <em>content <\/em>of what we\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s really an important point. It\u2019s something I feel I\u2019ve been better at keeping \u00a0in mind in own work: that is the content\u2014anything that seems like a disruption is actually what you have to work with, in a way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Adam:<\/strong> Information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monica:<\/strong> It\u2019s generative, it\u2019s information, it\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s never taking you away from the thing, it <em>is<\/em> the thing. But in terms of organizing something with big institutions, I think I still have to work at finding ways to make of room for when something like that happens\u2014because that is content to focus on just as much as anything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Adam:<\/strong> It really reminds me of what Monique said before, about believing in artificial realities, such as \u201cbeing dry\u201d, and how that breeds artificial securities. So how do we adapt and respond when the holes in that Potemkin fa\u00e7ade are broken,? Now just when we can see them but when we\u2019re experiencing them?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monica:<\/strong> Exactly, that\u2019s well put.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monique:<\/strong> I think the contradiction in these times of the so-called Anthropocene is that the solutions are often rooted in the problem. A classic example being that the restoration of the coast of South Louisiana, which is rapidly disappearing at one of the fastest rates on the planet, is essentially going to brought to us by all of these BP Deepwater disaster clean water act fines and so much of restoration will be dependent on royalties coming from Deepwater oil and gas heading into the future here. I think in our exhaustion we need to get out of that cycle of \u201coh, this thing that\u2019s killing us is maybe possibly going to help save us.\u201d When you feel like you have nothing else, I get that fear. Your fear can allow you to fall for ultimately false promises or short term solutions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monica:<\/strong> So it\u2019s about how to generate and use both reality and imagination to generate something else. Well, the \u201csomething else\u201d that\u2019s already there perhaps, just not as dominant.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Adam:<\/strong> Just thinking about solutions rooted in and emerging from the problems, that seems to be a dangerous and entropic cycle that will eventually come to an end.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monique:<\/strong> Hopefully!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Adam:<\/strong> [laughs] No, I mean like one way or another, the end will come! That\u2019s like the definition of entropy\u2014repeating the same thing, compounding the nature of it, and then hoping for different results. That\u2019s just a downward spiral. I think about that in relation to dominant languages of where to place the blame about issues that we\u2019re confronting, such as the flooding that\u2019s happening right now, the flooding in Jackson, the flooding upriver, the record soil saturation rates\u2014and that\u2019s before the snow\u2019s even melted. This greater language of blame being placed on the environment or rainfall or whatever, and not this acknowledgment of\u2026 I mean this is all basic stuff but it\u2019s also <em>not<\/em> the dominant language that exists. Where is there room for that? Is there room for that to shift? How does a convening of a River Campus begin to distil pertinent language that can then have a larger, greater, more extensive impact?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monica:<\/strong> I\u2019m thinking that when we have this transcription, some of these questions might be really good starting points! For example, this question of how does convening in a Campus begin to have a language? One of the things that I really noticed or felt, both in terms of where we took people and what we asked them to do and attune to, and in the little pamphlet that we made, was the fact that, for me, a constant for was time. And this is a lot less rooted in certain practicalities maybe but time as in past, and present, and future. Just yesterday I was listening to this <a href=\"https:\/\/onbeing.org\/programs\/ruby-sales-where-does-it-hurt\/\">podcast by Ruby Sales<\/a>, who is a public theologian and civil rights activist, and she talks about the ideas of hindsight, insight and foresight\u2014having all those visions is important. So in Congo Square, for example, we were asking people to be there right now, we were asking them to feel into that, to listen into that, to think about what came before and is still very present today \u2014the history of that place, the presence of that place. I think about when we were on the bus and driving down through St. Bernard Parish and Monique was pointing out so many things and talking about its present and its history. I think too about the skeletons of the live oak trees in the area, \u00a0one in particular that\u2019s nearly 600 years old, that\u2019s been around since the 1500s at least. And so many examples like that in the city. And then in the pamphlet, every page is thinking about time\u2014from the cover where we quoted Yaa Gyansi, who said what he wanted to capture with his project \u201cthe feeling of time, of having been part of something that stretched so far back, that was so impossibly large, that it was easy to forget that she, and he, and everyone else, existed in it \u2013 not apart from it, but inside it.\u201d I played this out in New Orleans and you can focus on so many specific places or specific histories and what they mean today, and it just highlights how, again, it\u2019s this microcosm of a lot of things in the country and a lot of things globally\u2014it calls out other systems. We\u2019d need more time to really get into that, but it\u2019s so productive to think about. Maybe \u201ctime\u201d isn\u2019t even the right singular word here, but it has a lot continuity among all the things we\u2019ve been talking about and asking people to do.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":28212,"id":28212,"title":"5P5A1173","filename":"5P5A1173-scaled.jpg","filesize":1664365,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/5p5a1173\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Photo by Camille Lenain","caption":"","name":"5p5a1173","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-08-10 16:09:07","modified":"2020-08-10 16:36:10","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1707,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-1536x1024.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-2048x1365.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5P5A1173-1600x1067.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><strong>Adam:<\/strong> In referencing the quote of something being so large, I think about this either lack of awareness or emergent understanding of being inside of something.

In a seminar that confronts the difficulties of being out of energy and out of ideas, participants will negotiate the many limits the Anthropocene confronts us with and how this has a severe effect on how we understand and exist within it. The way that this exhaustion can also mark the cessation of practices and approaches that are no longer fit for purpose will also be explored.<\/p>\n <p>A foundational issue in studying the effects of climate change is the possibility of exhaustion; of resources, of ways of life, of species, the oxygen starved \u201cdead\u201d hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet the exhaustion can also indicate the end point of some practices that have become less useful\u2014or even ways of life that were not so compelling in the first place. It could also account for the effective exhaustion of communities or activist groups trying to battle global issues and sustain ways of living in an increasingly vulnerable state. By visiting multiple sites downriver from Tulane University, this seminar will explore the roles of exhaustion and imagination as pertaining to ongoing ecological, cultural, and historical figurations in the area. Exhaustion and imagination will be viewed as concurrent themes that inform each other by decoding the many layers of anthropogenic behaviors expressed upon and within the landscape.<\/p>\n<p>One site that will be focused on during the seminar is a disappearing parcel of land in Plaquemines Parish, outside the federal levee protection system and south of the soon to be constructed Breton Sound sediment diversion. It is heritage of a legacy of generations connected to this river land, descendants of an ethnic European man and an enslaved woman. Those involved with the seminar will take on differing perspectives concerning this parcel of land and how its geomorphological transformations play into the themes of the seminar while also discussing philosophies of ownership and its relation to place. Other sites of exploration will include geological remnants of deltaic lobe building and sites that reveal current practices surrounding river constriction and diversion measures in the parishes of Orleans and Saint Bernard.<\/p>\n<p>Seminar participants will be in-situ to observe, sense, listen, and interact with a complex accumulation of anthropogenic layers at multiple scales throughout time. These sites will serve as test cases to understand local permutations of macro issues pertaining to planetary changes, commodity chains, infrastructural and ecological metabolism, and the duration and temporality of these systems, with a particular focus on the exhaustion of land, water, and the body.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Exhaustion and
