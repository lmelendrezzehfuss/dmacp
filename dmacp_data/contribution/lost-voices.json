Accordingly, new universalizing ideas of pedagogy, finance, governance, and capital, as well as culture, have created systems and institutions where the multiplicity of nature(s) (as local ecosystems, livelihoods, identities, ways of life, etc.) is unacknowledged. This has led to the ecological crisis, as marked by the Anthropocene, a consequence of the loss of the innumerable relationships in which people and nature have coexisted. For example, within a short period of recent human history, river natures in particular have been drastically altered by technology and capital. Their embedded forms are visible as steel towers, power lines, embankments, dams, and barrages, which have reshaped their flows and imposed a logic of \u201cfunction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>People who for centuries have interacted with and lived alongside riverbanks, riversides, or marshlands have paid the price in terms of their lives and lifestyles. Long-standing riverine communities can testify that nature is not a \u201cthing\u201d somewhere \u201cout there.\u201d They have shaped and been shaped by the landscapes they have inhabited. For example, referring to eastern India, the historian Arupjyoti Saika describes nineteenth-century colonial settlers discovering that \u201cthe floodplains of the (river) Brahmaputra constituted a complex agrarian landscape that demanded continuous interaction between the floodplains, hills and foothills.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Arupjyoti Saika, <em>The Unquiet River, a biography of the Brahmaputra<\/em>.

I was awestruck by the massive networks of water channels visible as threads in the delta below, where the meandering and channelized Mississippi River met the Gulf of Mexico. I could not but help reflect upon how its once free flows, interconnected with planetary systems of waters, had been shaped in deep time. More than ten thousand miles away, similar to the Mississippi Delta and the Gulf, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet with the Bay of Bengal, to form another huge braided estuary of shifting lands, silt, and water, which define the border between two nation states\u2014India and Bangladesh. Here too, the constant effort over the past couple of hundred years, has been to embank, control and dam the rivers. In fact, the relationship between these river systems has been more than notional. In 1955, Harvill E. Weller of the Mississippi River Commission was invited by the Indian Government to seek his advice on how to tame the wild Brahmaputra\u2014an example of an attempt to control river natures through global knowledge, technology, and capital, without accounting for their very heterogeneous landscape and demographic specifics. \u00a0It seems that they were all out to prove Mark Twain wrong when he wrote \u201cThe Mississippi will always have its own way: no engineering skills can persuade it to do otherwise.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><em> Mark Twain in Eruption: Hitherto Unpublished Pages About Men and Events<\/em>, edited by Bernard DeVoto.

Everything becomes diminutive, reduced to a human scale, not only in spatial but also in temporal terms, when seen from the eyes of communities that have lived there, yet who have been rendered invisible.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, a fusion of \u201cself\u201d with \u201cnature\u201d formed identities and value systems that recognized with humility and respect a supremacy of nature\u2014notions that many indigenous communities embedded within their knowledge systems. Indigenous cultures typically demonstrate ways in which complex everyday relationships with nature are regarded as reciprocal or integrated, with the natural world deemed to be held in trusteeship for future generations. Reflecting upon such tenancies towards nature, author Amitav Ghosh cites the tale of Bon Bibi, the forest god of the Bengal Sundarbans:<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span> Amitav Ghosh, Wild Fictions (2008), p. 13: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amitavghosh.com\/docs\/Wild%20Fictions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.amitavghosh.com\/docs\/Wild%20Fictions.pdf<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]he Bon Bibi legend uses the power of fiction to create and define a relationship between human beings and the natural world. Nowhere does a term equivalent to \u201cNature\u201d figure in the legend of Bon Bibi, yet nowhere is its consciousness absent; although ecological concerns are never named, the story is profoundly informed by that awareness which the literary critic Larry Buell has termed \u201cthe environmental unconscious\u201d\u2014a phrase that is all the more useful, in my view, because it does not invoke

had all these thoughts racing through my mind from New Orleans, where I had come from New Delhi to participate in the <em>Anthropocene River Campus<\/em> in November 2019, to visit an indigenous

The trip was undertaken as part of the Campus seminar entitled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-campus-the-human-delta\/seminar-claims-property\">Claims\/Property<\/a>, which sought to engage \u201cwith complicated entanglements of property claims that cut across the social, racial, and ecological landscapes of the of the Delta.\u201d Going to Pointe-Au-Chien posed two questions: How should we go there, a group of academics, artists and researchers, many of whom were visiting for the first time, and learn to listen to their ideas? And: how able were we to really comprehend a very different way of life and its perspectives?<\/p>\n<p>Both questions were about an ability to move out of fixed viewpoints of what we \u201cknow\u201d and to be able to listen to and understand what may be totally alien to us. Paradoxically, as a result of many modern approaches to education and learning, it seems that our ability to acknowledge and comprehend a standpoint entirely different from the mainstream has been curtailed. Hence the challenges these questions posed are not easy to overcome. Furthermore, in our desire to control and shape nature to our own ends, we have ceased to listen to its voices, its murmurs, and it silences.\u00a0 In fact, in the era of the Anthropocene, nature\u2019s complexity has been rendered inaudible.

undo the damage caused by the ecological crisis, destructive structures of political power need to be reconfigured, and the value systems that have shaped landscapes, cultures, languages, and relationships with the planet for time immemorial, need to be reintroduced. To do that, understanding diverse community experiences with nature, such as at Pointe-Au-Chien, could be key to forging a path of co-existence in the Anthropocene. But how does one do this in our current moment, when these ways of life are under threat and disappearing, and we may not even know how to comprehend their complexities anymore? Where does one begin?<\/p>\n<p>Listening with respect and an open mind is a good place to start\u2014even with the difficulties it brings. It can entail an onto-epistemological shift. For example, when engaging as an artist and environmentalist with traditional fisherfolk in Southern India, I wondered if we spoke a culturally common language. \u201cWas the sea I saw, the sea they saw?\u201d I wondered. While for me the sea was a limitless body of water sometimes beautiful, sometimes stormy or calm, in a distant and abstract way, for them it was a part of their lives, constituting an everyday coexistence of livelihood, experiences, and rituals. Hence listening is not simply about hearing but entails crossing boundaries and positions. It implies being in a mode of receiving and being respectful. It is also about reconstituting political and power positions, where the \u201cother\u201d is considered an equal. It is a de-colonizing of one\u2019s own gaze. It can allow one to visit a place and gain new understandings. As an ancient Zen Buddhist saying suggests, we should, \u201cempty the cup (of knowledge),\u201d and start listening with non-knowing and curiosity. With an empty cup, one can receive, and thereby understand in deeper ways.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27196,"id":27196,"title":"Ravi Agarwal India fishers","filename":"Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-scaled.jpg","filesize":687995,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/ravi-agarwal-india-fishers\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Photo by Ravi Agarwal","caption":"Fisherfolk at work in Southern India.","name":"ravi-agarwal-india-fishers","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-07-23 14:31:02","modified":"2020-07-28 12:29:28","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1703,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-768x511.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":511,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-768x511.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":511,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-1400x931.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":931,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-1536x1022.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1022,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-2048x1363.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1363,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Ravi-Agarwal-India-fishers-1600x1065.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1065}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>Finally, if we succeed in this venture, how might we bring back a diversity of ways of being with nature and change the manner in which the planet is lived on?

This seminar engages the complicated entanglements of property claims that cut across the social, racial, and ecological landscapes of the Mississippi Delta, while connecting them to upriver struggles, as well as to the meaning of the Anthropocene itself.<\/p>\n <p>The practices of controlling land and water inherent to property ownership are also tools of the Anthropocene, the effects of which intersect historical and contemporary conflicts over land and property down the length of the Mississippi. This is particularly true in the Delta, where flooding, intrusion, and efforts to reclaim land can\u2019t be separated from the attachments, needs, and claims of specific communities. This seminar examines claims to land amid the shifting registers of property within an intertidal landscape, where fluid dynamics of river and tide literally undermine land through processes that necessitate constant engineering and vigilance.<\/p>\n<p>Capital also exerts deterritorializing force on communities throughout the Delta as slow violence: real estate speculation triggers gentrification and displacement; petro-chemicals migrate into marginalized frontline bodies; ecosystems degrade. Such slippages between land, property, capital, and claims result in a contested ground where definitions and designations shift, impacted by tidal cycles of neoliberal governance; buffered by community organizing, agency, and resistance. In this destabilized environment, who claims care for particular lands, on what basis, and how? How do legacies of settler colonialism and slavery live on in property claims, conflicts, and contradictions? What role does (anthropogenic) environmental change play in casting property\/ownership into a different light? Conversely, are there risks in moving \u201cbeyond\u201d property when marginalized communities claim land as property in the face of dispossession? As with any effort to locate an \u201cotherwise\u201d in or to the present, who is empowered to do so is often unequal and how we ask questions is never innocent.<\/p>\n<p>The seminar is structured around critical site visits in and around New Orleans that magnify contestations over the designation, control, or condition of land. It is informed by local researchers and activists, beginning with the Geographies of Black Displacement tour led by convener Shana M. griffin. This brings into view post-Katrina gentrification and black displacement; the paradox of real estate capital flooding into an area threatened by sea-level rise; a perspective aligning climate change, property, race, and class.<\/p>\n<p>Subsequently, a field visit with the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe (PACIT) will take the seminar about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans, deep in the bayous and swamplands of unclear and rapidly changing boundaries between land and water along the coast. Geneva Lebeouf, Christine Verdin, and PACIT members will guide an exploration down Island Road to the thin strip of land where the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe are facing the existential threat and urgency of sea-level rise that is causing them to consider the loaded possibility of relocating from their ancestral lands. Over a meal together, generously prepared by Tribal members at the PACIT Community Center, the region will be reflected together and experiences of rapid land loss, subsidence, the impacts of oil and gas industries, and strategies of adaptation to these changes in the landscape and frequent flooding events will be discussed.<\/p>\n<p>These shifting landscapes of inundation and chemical trespass, as well as zones of multi-species inhabitation, serve as a provocation to (private) property\u2019s political and economic organizing principle and to the liberal sense of self (\u201cproperty in self\u201d). The final session provides opportunity to develop imaginative scenarios and potential forms of resistance rooted in the nuances of situations observed.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar:
