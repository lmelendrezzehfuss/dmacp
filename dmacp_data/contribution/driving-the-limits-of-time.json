Simple questions can be the hardest to answer. In advance of opening the <em>Anthropocene River Campus<\/em> in New Orleans, organizers of the seminar \u201cClashing Temporalities\u201d asked participants to think very deeply about where they were. With a little reflection, it becomes clear that, the deeper you think about where you are, what first appears as a fixed substrate, firm and solid beneath one\u2019s feet, can\u2014with a little imagination\u2014become dynamic once more. Particularly when we let our perspectives extend beyond the diurnal and mediatic temporalities that govern our everyday lives, past the overheated pulses of human history, and, further still, into the fathomlessness of geological time.<\/p>\n<p>In response to our request, we received a number of accounts of terrestrial situatedness that attested to both the imagination and the geographic reach of our participants. A townhouse in Troy, New York, whose foundations rest on lead-poisoned soil. Someone\u2019s hometown near Pliocene ravines in the Argentinian Pampas, formed over 2.5 million years ago. An account of the Alpine-Carpathian Basin, where the city of Vienna lies and whose oil fueled National Socialism. A newly purchased marital home in South Africa atop granite rocks formed when waters receded from the Cape Flats of Gondwanaland. The unglaciated topography of the Midwestern Driftless Area. An archaeological site south of Chiang Mai, Thailand, resting on the Shan-Thai Terrane tectonic plate. The attic study of the secretary of the Anthropocene Working Group, built on Mercia Mudstone clay, remnants of the shallow saline lakes of the Pangean supercontinent, back when the United Kingdom lay twenty to thirty degrees north of the equator. Most of our participants from New Orleans noted a more immediate plasticity to their surroundings. Their feet rested on thick and fairly recently deposited alluvial sediment, a shifting morass that means the city is, as one resident later told me, \u201clike a concrete lily pad floating on a pond.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A number of tools are available to interrogate the temporality of where we stand. These range from human memory and shared anecdotes to songs and stories, and the carefully archived records of powerful institutions. Geologists possess a unique apparatus for such time travel. With something akin to an apple corer, driven vertically into Earth\u2019s surface, they can extract an excerpt of planetary time. These \u201ccores\u201d are a record of the seemingly chaotic processes of erosion, weathering, and hydrology that are set in motion by earthly processes. When the sediment these processes create relents to gravity, it forms layers, and so within our corer lies a tube of matter, a punctiform snapshot of areal sheets. Such cores, in the words of marine biologist Rachel Carson, offer \u201ca sort of epic poem of the earth.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span> Rachel Carson, <em>The Sea around Us<\/em><em>.<\/em> Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, p. 60.<\/span><\/span> Their order, width, and composition\u2014or laminations\u2014register major and minor shifts in telluric keys. Cataloging present surface to deep past, cores can reveal myriad changes, from that of local farming practices to global climate, insofar as such change can register in the chemical composition of the core or in the pattern and spacing of its layers. The \u201cClashing Temporalities\u201d seminar was intended to consider the relation between all kinds of temporal registers, to see how geological, historical, rhythmic, and experiential time fold in on one another. Our aim was to come to a better understanding of the indivisibility of time into human and nonhuman scales, and to trace the causal relations between past and present that have contributed to the strange concatenation of human and Earth history we now find ourselves in.<\/p>\n<p>In planning the seminar, using a now ubiquitous video-conferencing software, it was clear that negotiation and compromise would be necessary. Each person organizing the session came from a different place and a different school of thought. A professor of coastal and urban estuaries, a polymath naturalist musician, a sedimentologist, and a historical geographer. Bridging time zones to reach one another, it became clear that differences in situatedness, scientific training, beliefs, life experience, and opinion would lead, if not to clashing personalities, then to clashing expectations as to who and what forms of testimony were essential to communicate the significance of the sites we would encounter. Minor disputes over content, partners, location, timings, and involvement were, to everyone\u2019s credit, resolved with sensitivity and kindness. The outcome of these discussions, I think, demonstrated that clashes can be generative, resolvable, and, in the run of things, can allow for a better appreciation of one another\u2019s positions and the constraints and achievements by which perspectives are formed. We proved that song can be of geoscientific significance, providing an emotive record of the waves of cultural history that have impacted upon the Earth, and that meditating on a core sample\u2014an exercise in temporal mind expansion\u2014can offer its own inspiring resonances.<\/p>\n<p>On the first day of the Anthropocene River Campus, we boarded our time machine on McAlister Drive, just beyond Tulane University. In scenes reminiscent of school trips of yore, roll call was taken and po\u2019boy sandwiches and cookies stored in overhead lockers. After days of intense meetings in air-conditioned auditoriums, it was refreshing to head out of the city, west along the sinuous Highway 18, the old River Road. For some, this was the first time they had laid eyes on the Mississippi River, and our local conveners, Bruce Sunpie Barnes and Amy Lesen, pointed out the almost absurdly illustrative sites as we passed by: from simple houseboats, which, like the state\u2019s refineries, exist in regulatory niches that allow their owners to subvert taxation, in this case by risking life on the water, to cropped sugarcane, whose remaining bagasse burnt like a fuse across neat, rectangular fields, its smoke adding an acrid note to the recycled air of the bus.<\/p>\n<p>As we moved onward, Amy and Bruce shared their wide-ranging expertise over the crackly intercom, guiding us through an environment in which the past and present concerns many of us had only read about were very real. As Amy noted, this region is less a still life than a dynamic \u201ccascading series of events.\u201d Our route traced permeable interfaces between industrial archaeology and hydrogeography. We passed the Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway, a vast sluice that controls the river\u2019s flow into the brackish Lake Pontchartrain. Amy told us that this mechanism had required more regular operation in a period of unprecedented rainfall. In fact an estuary rather than a lake, Pontchartrain\u2019s incursion into the surrounding lands can be plotted by the waiflike cypresses that have succumbed to the salinity of its waters. A more constant companion were the concrete and turf-clad levees, which, at twenty feet high, persistently obscure the river. To a well-trained eye, surface traces of subterranean pipelines could also be discerned here and there, furtively channeling hydrocarbons through thick and unstable mud.<\/p>\n<p>With considerable skill, our driver negotiated the narrow roads of the township of Pierre Part, in Assumption Parish. Our bus, scraped by the low-hanging branches of live oaks, came to a stop, and we poured out. It was an absurd entrance into this thick-aired site of backyard domesticity. Artists, academics, and concerned citizens from around the world had arrived at the home of a welcoming, if somewhat bemused, family. Thanks to Bruce, we were there by invitation. We were greeted by eighty-two-year-old fisherman Mr. Daigle, whose home it was, as well as his son Kevin and a cast of other family members and curious neighbors. The Diagles are Acadian, descendants of French-speaking people from Atlantic Canada who the British forcefully deported from that region in the 1700s.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span> Geneve Daigle Cavalier and Tre\u2019 Michael Caballero, <em>Recollections of Pierre Part<\/em>.

His great familiarity with the life cycles of these creatures and his firsthand experience of working this watery land have directly shown he and his family how changes in mean global temperature have affected their immediate environment and the prospects of deriving a living from it; put succinctly by Vivian, a resident of Pierre Part, \u201cthe seasons are messed up now.\u201d<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27367,"id":27367,"title":"Mr Diagle, his son Kevin, and Bruce Sunpie Barnes on the porch of the Diagle Family Home, Pierre Part, Atchafalaya Basin","filename":"Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-scaled.jpeg","filesize":544842,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-scaled.jpeg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/mr-diagle-his-son-kevin-and-bruce-sunpie-barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-diagle-family-home-pierre-part-atchafalaya-basin\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Photo by Neli Wagner","caption":"Mr Diagle, his son Kevin, and Bruce Sunpie Barnes on the porch of the Diagle Family Home, Pierre Part, Atchafalaya Basin.","name":"mr-diagle-his-son-kevin-and-bruce-sunpie-barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-diagle-family-home-pierre-part-atchafalaya-basin","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-07-24 12:19:08","modified":"2020-07-24 12:34:26","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1707,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-768x512.jpeg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-300x200.jpeg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-768x512.jpeg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-1400x933.jpeg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-1536x1024.jpeg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-2048x1365.jpeg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-48x48.jpeg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Mr-Diagle-his-son-Kevin-and-Bruce-Sunpie-Barnes-on-the-porch-of-the-Diagle-Family-Home-Pierre-Part-Atchafalaya-Basin-1600x1067.jpeg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>The Diagles\u2019 family home lies in the Atchafalaya Basin, a watershed through which only a denuded branch of the Mississippi now runs. The majority of the Lower Mississippi\u2019s flow has long been diverted by the upriver Old River Control Complex, a towering dam that divvies up the channel and protects against flooding during periods of high water. The diversion of the river, which begun in the early nineteenth century, helps to maintain the wetland we found ourselves in, and contributes to the stabilization of communities such as Pierre Part. But any sense of calm can be shaken off by learning a little of the river\u2019s history. Its main branch, the Atchafalaya Basin bypass, is due to avulse, that is, to shift its path. This avulsion will occur when the 150 million tons of sediment that pass through the river each year sculpt a new path of least resistance through the landscape\u2019s topography. The last time this happened was around 2,000 years ago. A shift is long overdue, and humans may be helping to induce it. Increased rainfall, partly fueled by the accumulated effects of fossil fuel use, requires upriver floodgates such as the Old River Control Complex to be opened with greater frequency to protect downriver cities, particularly New Orleans. More frequent inundation of the upper reaches of the Atchafalaya is a gamble\u2014a depositional crapshoot that risks causing the Mississippi bypass to turn west and course though the Atchafalaya Basin, potentially destroying and certainly transforming communities such as Pierre Part. <span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span> James F.

Sitting up front with the microphone was research geologist and paleobotanist Scott Wing, a member of the Anthropocene Working Group. He has family in nearby Morgan City, and he took the opportunity to combine his concern for the region with his scientific training, giving us insight into the long history of hydrocarbon formation in this place. The majority of Louisiana\u2019s petroleum began its formation during the Mesozoic era, over 180 million years ago. As the continent\u2019s largest watershed, the geomorphological precursors to the Mississippi River Basin acted as vast catchall for accumulating organic matter. Organisms such as algae and plankton were drawn into the river\u2019s flow, forming thick mats of biological matter at the mouth of what is now the Gulf of Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>These batteries of decaying compounds were slowly inundated with layers of sediment\u2014a slow burial in a geological pressure cooker. Such was the pressure exerted that the Earth\u2019s crust bowed and subsided. The heat this process generated slowly altered the chemical structure of the entombed organic matter, cracking the former fruits of photosynthesis into reservoirs of liquid hydrocarbons topped by lighter gas fractions. Alongside the state of Louisiana\u2019s lax regulatory regime, it is this slow motion geological circumstance that partly explains the profusion of petrochemical plants that cluster in Louisiana. With a constant procession of refineries and sulfur piles passing by our now bug-splattered windows, the toll that our pact with long-fossilized biota is exacting was clear. This unlikely sequence of Earthly events found its way into, among other things, the pistons of our bus\u2019s six-cylinder combustion engine. There, carbon became heat, and heat the motion pushing us onward.

Back in the bus. This time our destination was the productive heart of the region\u2019s hydrocarbon industry: Baton Rouge. We were headed there thanks to the initiative of Catherine Russell, a sedimentologist who carries out research upriver from the city. Pulling cores of muddy sediment from the land, she tries to better understand the complex reciprocities that have taken place between the river, its sediment, and the geomorphology through which it flows. Once more heading out along the River Road, we arrived \u00a0at the Louisiana State University (LSU) Center for River Studies, where professor Clinton Willson welcomed us into an information-packed visitor center. We were there to see what is perhaps the world\u2019s largest working analog model of a river system. At ten thousand square feet, the table top model fills a space the size of a sports hall. Varying sediment loads can be simulated across its vast planar surface, which represents the Lower River, approximating the alteration to depositional processes caused by upriver hydroengineering. Like a giant battlefield diorama, the model is intended to allow for strategizing how to best manage the coastal subsidence. As we entered, research-student Godzillas scrambled off the model. A bombastic animated presentation was then projected onto the planar surface of the model, with a disembodied voice telling of inevitable land loss and controlled retreat, a narrative of control projected by the LSU River Studies Center on behalf of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA).<\/p>\n<p>The presentation inadvertently made it clear that the model is as much a public relations tool as a scientific apparatus. It is used to demonstrate the CPRA\u2019s commitment to the scientific management of Louisiana\u2019s ongoing land loss due to shifting sedimentation patterns, sea-level rise, and land use. What lies beyond the artifice of the model\u2019s closed world are critical voices of those who see the CPRA as a malign force. Its $50 billion comprehensive Coastal Master Plan\u2014published in 2017 and outlining the protection of this section of the Gulf Coast via restructuring, restoration, and resettlement\u2014is considered by some to be insensitive to the lives and livelihoods of those who make their home in the area. With us that day was anthropologist Nathan Jessee, who works with the Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe (IDJC). The tribe\u2019s land, Isle de Jean Charles, is scheduled for retreat under the CPRA\u2019s plan.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":27363,"id":27363,"title":"LSU

Among the biggest criticisms is that the CPRA plan fails to act on the ongoing role of the petrochemical industry in accelerating land loss. Shifting patterns of deposition, upriver engineering, and the gradient of the tectonic plate that the coast lies on means subsidence is inevitable, but the incessant pumping of oil and gas from coastal reservoirs, the dredging of sediment, and the growing network of subterranean pipelines and their attendant maintenance canals speeds up this loss.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Ian Gray, \u201cOutrunning the Anthropocene?\u201d: https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/outrunning-the-anthropocene<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The river model, and Nathan\u2019s interjection, emphasized that even when one is looking back to the 400-million-year history of the river\u2019s sedimentary processes, there is no aspect of science that lies beyond politics\u2014just as there is no form of politics free from the constraints of the physical world.

We disembarked from the bus on the western side of the False River Lake and crossed a busy road in a cold wind. From this spot, we could view the lake and gain some sense as to why such seemingly prosaic sites are so important for historians of earthly processes. It takes some imagination to reconstruct the deep history of such a subtly remarkable place. To a considerable degree, geology is a feat of the imagination, using points of evidence from sites like the one before us to reconstruct a deep understanding of the processes that fashioned our terrestrial home. By now, tiredness hung over the group as a result of the steady influx of encounters: we had experienced the imagination and creativity that lies behind geoscientific rigor, while geoscientists had experienced the rigor, critical voices, and breadth of knowledge that underlies many forms of humanistic expression. Points of coherence in world views had been arrived at.

In attending to time, layers, and sediment, this seminar brings geology and conceptualizations of different timescales into close contact with the human sciences, the arts, and Pierre Part, a community who live according to the movements of the River.<\/p>\n <p>This seminar focuses on the concepts of layers and time. Sedimentary layers, layers of human experience, and the layers of industrialization in Louisiana\u2019s Mississippi \u201cchemical corridor.\u201d It will also explore many timescales at play in the river\u2019s sphere, from the long and astronomic to those of the river\u2019s evolution, to human history, and the lifespans of organisms. Cycles of human cultural or industrial processes often fail to synchronize with the layers and rhythmic cycles of many other biological, geological, and ecological processes, including the temporality of the flow of the river itself. Mis-matching rhythms of human practices also cause political tension and conflict over ways of life. The concept of the Anthropocene provides a space to think about these clashes of temporalities more explicitly. Through these tensions, we can begin to unpack how human and nonhuman temporalities affect each other and disentangle the cascading effects of unsynchronized cycles or accelerating processes. It will also investigate the different sedimentary layers along the river\u2019s path. Rachel Carson described the sediment record as \u201ca sort of epic poem of the Earth\u201d\u2014in arguably the first century of the Anthropocene, this layered waterborne matter also offers direct evidence of human impacts. Thus, the core objective of this seminar is to understand the Mississippi as a central actor in this anthro-geoscientific saga. The post-war period has been marked by \u201cnovel sediments,\u201d one of the most pervasive of which is plastic, the distribution and layering of which provides a potential marker of anthropogenic influence. Along the Mississippi plenty of plastic is produced by the region\u2019s petrochemical giants. But sediment is not just degraded and lost; the Wax Lake Outlet to the south of Pierre Part is growing as sediment accumulates and forms a new delta. Better understood, the management of sediment can provide a means to work against land loss and sea level rise along the Gulf coast.<\/p>\n<p>Multiple sensory pathways\u2014visual, auditory, tactile\u2014will navigate these different timescales and layers. The seminar will begin with a journey to the township of Pierre Part in Assumption Parish. Pierre Part residents live near the path of one of the river\u2019s main release valves, the Morganza Spillway. When opened, it threatens the town with waterborne sediment. Guided by local experts Bruce Barnes and Amy Lesen, the seminar will meet citizens from Pierre Part and discuss the effects of River Basin movements on people\u2019s lives in the area. We will weave music and song into our experience throughout the day. Returning to NOLA along Highway 18 (the Old River Road) at the end of Day 1 will entail dialogue on concepts of time and recognize the visual evidence of industrial layers and human history, such as plantations and chemical plants. Amy and Bruce will narrate a history of environmental and cultural change as we re-approach the city. Traveling on Day 2 to Baton Rouge, participants will visit the Louisiana State University\u2019s Lower Mississippi River model, which will demonstrate the dynamic river system and sedimentation processes there. Participants will also have the opportunity to engage with a core sample taken from the False River Point bar, a bow shaped water body formed by upriver deposition, and to visit the False River site.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Clashing
