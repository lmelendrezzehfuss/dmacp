Through case-study analysis we aimed to foster the development of specific conceptual and practical tools; we aimed to experience the anthropocenic dimensions performed by the communities through the landscapes we observe on the ground, within our mind, and through our cultures.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Anthropogenic Landscapes","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-anthropogenic-landscapes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-30 17:07:22","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-30 15:07:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20767","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-anthropogenic-landscapes\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":20768,"id":20768,"title":"Benedikt Rugar_Anthropogenic Landscapes","filename":"HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes.jpg","filesize":1729963,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-anthropogenic-landscapes\/hkw_anthropogenic-landscapes\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_anthropogenic-landscapes","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20767,"date":"2020-02-27 17:12:22","modified":"2020-03-02 10:37:55","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":7418,"height":4800,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-768x497.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":497,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-300x194.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":194,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-768x497.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":497,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-1400x906.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":906,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":994,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1325,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Anthropogenic-Landscapes-1600x1035.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1035}},"teaser_text":"<p class=\"text\">Anthropogenic Landscapes ground us in the Anthropocene.
