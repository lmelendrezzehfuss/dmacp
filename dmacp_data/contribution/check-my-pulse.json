An Anthropocene River<\/em> was a continental-scale experiment in distributed perception. All the participants began at a particular place, somewhere with water in a territory. As artists and researchers, we tried to open up the expressivity of those places. You could travel to the different field stations, and there was also a river journey. Claire Pentecost and I would go to Lake Itasca and paddle the Headwaters, and then after our own field station was complete we would rejoin the river travelers at the confluence of the Ohio and the Mississippi, get in the long voyageur canoes, and follow the currents to a town called New Madrid. Everyone who possibly could was going to meet again at the Human Delta event in New Orleans\u2014or somewhere else downstream. Floating over all this was the idea, or the dream, that we could take one of the central concepts of Earth systems science, the hydrological cycle, and turn it into something subjective, intimate, and shareable within particular communities.<\/p>\n<p>The thing that inspired me most were the swamps, and a scientific paper called \u201cThe Flood-Pulse Concept in River-Floodplain Systems.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Wolfgang J. Junk, Peter B. Bayley, and Richard E. Sparks, \u201cThe Flood Pulse Concept in River-Floodplain Systems,\u201d <em>Canadian Special Publication of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences<\/em> 106, no. 1 (1989): pp. 110\u201327.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the idea: a river is not a linear continuum stretching from source to sea. Instead it\u2019s a fluctuating \u201caquatic\/terrestrial transition zone.\u201d Its ecological significance lies not within its established channel, but in its capacity to overflow its banks according to a seasonal pulse determined by snowmelt, rainfall, and the intrinsic conditions of the floodplain itself. The authors speak of a \u201cmoving littoral\u201d or mobile shoreline, offering the image of a dynamic process that does not disrupt, but rather, defines the river. This concept is beautiful to the mind and verifiable with the eye\u2014but you\u2019ll see that the moving littoral immediately runs into walls constructed by human beings. Moving between the temporal variability of the flood and the vast, frozen system of engineered levees and dams that attempts to contain it, a group of us tried to touch the pulse of the Anthropocene River. At our field station, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-4-confluence-ecologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Confluence Ecologie<\/a>s, we held an exhibition devoted to the theme. The hope was that traveling by canoe would provide, not only a vantage from which to observe these dynamic relations, but also a context in which to discuss them.<\/p>\n<p>So what happened? As often, the experience was full of unexpected events, and at times overwhelming. As the entire program reached its close I realized there was something involved that I hadn\u2019t understood. What\u2019s more, this was the fundamental thing, the core idea of the Anthropocene. Nature itself is political, not by definition or essence, but because it is everywhere infused with the consequences of power relations between human beings. For sure, all of our field station groups discussed such power relations constantly, in conversations that ranged from Black and Indigenous histories to the legacy of synthetic nitrogen or nuclear weapons. The difficulty for me was connecting the conversations to the contours of the territory, which are both cultural and psychic. There are forms of unconscious resistance that are transpersonal, and that act to maintain the paralyzed structures of Anthropocene society. These resistances not only block one\u2019s perception: they block us from really living. They leave us incapable of responding to the tragedy of global ecological destruction. This difficulty is something I want to share in retrospect. I kept thinking back to the refrain of a famous 1959 avant-garde film by Alain Resnais: \u201cYou saw nothing in Hiroshima.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><em>Hiroshima, mon amour<\/em>, feature film, directed by Alain Resnais (France, Japan: Argos-Films, Como Films, Daiei Studios, Path\u00e9 Entertainment, 1959).<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Everything goes ahead in advance. In the light of recent street protests for Black lives throughout the world, and in the more intimate light of local realities presented by so many fierce and tender collaborators during the Human Delta program in New Orleans, it seems obvious that the story of the Anthropocene River should be told in reverse. The journey started up north, but the postscript has to begin at river\u2019s end, with a social form of the not-so-distant past: the forced labor camps known as plantations.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Visit the Whitney Plantation (https:\/\/www.whitneyplantation.org) or read Jared Keller, \u201cInside America\u2019s Auschwitz,\u201d <em>Smithsonian Magazine<\/em>, Apr 4, 2016, https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/history\/inside-americas-auschwitz-180958647.<\/span><\/span> Their ominous or trivialized remains are preserved behind high levees that now protect, not sugarcane or cotton, but oil and chemical plants, in a place that everyone in America knows as Cancer Alley. The water itself flows differently there. The pulse, not only of the flood, and not only of our own bodies, but of the entire planetary metabolism, has been influenced by power relations that took both social and ecological form just upriver from New Orleans. These are race relations. You can see them in yourself, you can see them in the land. The point is to work through them and change their unjust consequences.

Yet the project was completed without any rethink of the initial land-use pattern. \u201cThe original conception of the Mississippi Delta as a carceral landscape, held together by coerced labor, curtailed any ability to imagine a radically different technical environment,\u201d writes Davis. It\u2019s as though river engineering itself had become a form of Jim Crow: the tacit maintenance in fact of a set of violent relations that have supposedly been abolished by law. To understand how the carceral landscape was modernized, I want to take you to the spot where large-scale federal engineering began on the Mississippi. This place was on the River Journey\u2019s initial program, but another direction proved more relevant.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Shreve\u2019s Cut<\/strong><\/h1>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27414,"id":27414,"title":"4.

Enslaved people were forced to build levees and drain agricultural land in the Atchafalaya Basin, as planters started cotton production far from any reliable transportation.

Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2017.<\/span><\/span> An iron scraper was attached to the snagboat&#8217;s windlasses to drag the excavated soil to the water&#8217;s edge, dispersing it into the current. Thus a new channel just a few feet deep was etched into the earth, ready for the erosive force of the water. If successful, the shallow channel would become the river&#8217;s deep bed. The cut would then be the equivalent of the portage, but for steamboats. It would shorten travel time, and, Shreve reasoned, it would pull the water of the Red toward a deeper and more swiftly flowing Mississippi. This would clear the shoals that continually formed around the Red&#8217;s mouth, impeding commerce. An open interchange between the Mississippi, the Red and the Atchafalaya would then take form, allowing steamboat traffic in all directions, plus further settlement of valuable cotton-growing land to the northwest, up the Red. The captain of the <em>Heliopolis<\/em> was attempting an integrated solution, based on the convergent calculation of multiple dynamic factors. Yet there was only one way to find out if his reasoning was correct. That was the act itself, the decisive cut.<\/p>\n<p>A week after the work was complete, the Mississippi had shifted its course. A new and shorter route had opened. What&#8217;s more, the sandy shoals at the mouth of the Red River began to disperse, as predicted. Yet as the water level sank in the abandoned channel later known as Old River, the behavior of the Red began to change. When the Mississippi ran low, most of the Red\u2019s flow would wrap around the bend of Old River to join the mainstem. But when the Mississippi ran high, the Red would seek a lower outlet in the Atchafalaya. What\u2019s more, the sediment that formerly gathered in shoals around the mouth of the Red had merely shifted, settling in the lower reaches of Old River. This new sedimentation blocked the free interchange between the three, to the point where dredging was soon required. It also encouraged the Red&#8217;s flow into the Atchafalaya. At the end of a long chain of unforeseen consequences, what appeared on the horizon a few decades later was a possible jump, an avulsion of the Mississippi. In the midst of some great storm the river would rage over its banks, tear through the low-lying marshes, and transform the narrow and sluggish Atchafalaya into its new pathway to the sea.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":28122,"id":28122,"title":"Old-River-Control","filename":"Old-River-Control.jpg","filesize":688198,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/old-river-control\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"","caption":"","name":"old-river-control","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-08-10 09:58:09","modified":"2020-08-10 09:58:43","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1448,"height":877,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control-768x465.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":465,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control-300x182.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":182,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control-768x465.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":465,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control-1400x848.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":848,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control.jpg","1536x1536-width":1448,"1536x1536-height":877,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control.jpg","2048x2048-width":1448,"2048x2048-height":877,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Old-River-Control.jpg","feature-width":1448,"feature-height":877}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>Shreve\u2019s cut set the pattern for future federal control of the river.

Most Blacks left for the North; others gathered in the towns and cities. Machines now do most of the work. But in the early twentieth century, during the heyday of the blues, it was a different story. This was a tightly packed landscape of small plots, company towns, shotgun shacks, juke joints, cotton gins, and prosperous riverports, divided strictly by race and unified by the overarching project of a New South built on highly capitalized but only partially industrialized agriculture. Sharecropping gave tenants a direct benefit from their own labor on self-managed parcels ceded temporarily by the owner in exchange for a share of the harvest; for that reason it was more attractive to freedpeople who did not want to work in gangs under direct orders.

This doctrine refused the idea that artificial outlets could ease flooding, and indeed, it suggested that natural outlets should be closed. It also rejected oxbow cutoffs. However, as Barry shows, the levees-only doctrine took perverse inspiration from the work of St. Louis native James Eads, a self-taught engineer and a fervent admirer of Henry Shreve. Using sunken jetties made of woven willow mats, Eads was able to concentrate the flow of the Mississippi at its mouth, dispersing the sandbar that blocked the entry of ocean-going ships at South Pass. His success became an implicit justification for the idea that levees alone would create a \u201cself-scouring river,\u201d deepening the channel with the abrasive power of its own current and increasing its capacity to carry floodwaters to the sea. But there was a flaw: the levees, often set back at great distances from the channel, could never produce the concentrating effect of jetties sunken directly alongside the central current. What they did instead was to raise floodwaters to catastrophic heights, by totally eliminating the aquatic\/terrestrial transition zone.<\/p>\n<p>Barry makes it clear that the engineering of the Mississippi River Commission did not only serve to preserve the market city of New Orleans, where many downtown streets are six feet below sea level. It also served to open up a new agricultural space for the South\u2019s most profitable export crop. The colonization of the Delta, still almost wild at the end of the Civil War, began in earnest with the extension of the Illinois Central Railroad into the region in the late 1870s. Other railroads followed, encouraging further swamp clearance and the perspective of a vast increase in cotton production. Yet despite the privately and publicly financed improvements, still less than a third of Delta had been cleared by 1900. It remained a frontier, a \u201cprecarious landscape\u201d in John Dean Davis\u2019s phrase, providing no guarantees to its inhabitants.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27419,"id":27419,"title":"10.

To do so they created the Headwaters Diversion Channel, which is a broad open ditch flanked to the south by a levee, conveying the combined flow of the Castor and Whitewater Rivers to the Mississippi just downstream of Cape Girardeau.

As prodigious rainfall swept snowmelt into the northern watersheds, the levels of the Mississippi and the Ohio rose ever higher around Cairo, until finally on April 25 sand boils began erupting at the base of the city\u2019s defensive works, heralding levee failure. Three days later the Ohio River reached a height of fifty-eight feet on the Cairo gage: that\u2019s the legal threshold for activation of the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway.

Understanding the Anthropocene River takes 500 years of human and natural history, entangled into the forms of the land and the people. That entanglement is the distinctive subject\/object of Earth systems science, from my outsider\u2019s point of view anyway. Today, both the social and the natural relations appear frozen in the ghostly system, the MR&amp;T. Still the most relevant thing to interpret is the way the shoreline actually moves\u2014not only through explosive detonation, but also through seepage.<\/p>\n<p>There are many remnant wetlands in the Mississippi Valley, and particularly in the Confluence region. But the places where the aquatic\/terrestrial transition zone reaches an ecosystemic scale often involve aberrant functions of the engineering works. One example can be found at the base of the Delta, just north of Vicksburg, where a federal levee system defends against both the Yazoo River to the east, and the Mississippi to the west. The double wall sweeps around the bottom of the Delta in a great arc, creating a kind of enclosing bowl with a floodgate for a drain. When the Yazoo runs high the floodgate is closed, and then rainwater seeping down from the north pools <em>inside<\/em> the levee system, causing major flooding that can last throughout the summer and into the fall, as it did in 2019. Obviously this is hard on the farmers, who expect dry fields by June.

A frontline levee defends against the Mississippi; but this is the one that can be dynamited at Birds Point. A setback levee a few miles east of the first is designed to contain and channel the diverted Mississippi waters; but it too has a floodgate at the bottom that must be closed against high water. That high water comes from the Mississippi River backflooding into St. John\u2019s Bayou, a former meandering stream now transformed into a wide agricultural ditch. As in the Yazoo Basin, the initial plan was to place a gate at the mouth of the bayou, seal it against the high water from the river, and install pumps to drain the swamp for agriculture. The Army Corps tried no less than seven times to complete this plan; but each time, the ecological values of this seasonally flooded transition zone prompted resistance.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>The last attempt was stopped in 2017: Council on Environmental Quality, \u201cResolution of the December 6, 2016 Department of Interior Referral to the Council on Environmental Quality of the Environmental Impact Statement for the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 St. Johns New Madrid Floodway Project\u201d (2017): https:\/\/ceq.doe.gov\/docs\/nepa-practice\/2.19.17-Resolution-letter-on-New-Madrid-project.pdf<\/span><\/span> The result is that every year, St. John\u2019s Bayou backfloods into the territory immediately northwest of New Madrid, filling the base of the floodway. This means that the floodgate on the setback levee must be closed; and at that point, the whole intricate system of pipes and ditches and channels that drains the Bootheel can do nothing but inundate the land <em>behind<\/em> the setback levee. At the peak of the season, usually in late spring, the inland flood rises to levels only marginally lower than the backflooding river. What results is a panorama almost unbelievable for those who don\u2019t see it every year: great sheets of water drowning farms and forests on <em>either side<\/em> of a thirty-foot protective levee that was built to keep everything dry and secure. This is the industrial version of flood-pulse ecology. Yet there\u2019s another result, which is equally amazing: despite all the grumbling and disappointment, the farmers return to their flooded fields every year, and with some help from small, tractor-powered pumps, they manage to get a crop of beans in the ground by July, ensuring a successful harvest from the incredibly fertile soil. Contrary to industrial expectations, these soybean farmers are beginning to live with the seasonal pulse, alongside all the birds, animals, insects, and fish that inhabit the aquatic\/terrestrial transition zone.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27425,"id":27425,"title":"16.

It was a beautiful sunny day with seven or eight of us in a single canoe, and the fatigue of the river vanished as we moved up the channel, with egrets crossing our bow and big fish (probably Asian carp) jumping high out of the water. We reached the floodgate, pulled the canoe onto an extremely muddy bank, and went running up to the top of the levee where I knew we would see wall-to-wall soybeans, green like money on the world market. In fact, there was nothing but bare, dark earth on both sides. That summer, the floodwaters had persisted too long to plant. My spirit went reeling around this great wheel of black earth, furrowed in many places by the plow, but barren of any crop.
