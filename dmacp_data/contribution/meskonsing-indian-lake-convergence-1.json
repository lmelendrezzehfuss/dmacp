Sitting halfway between Lake Mendota in Madison and the Wisconsin River at Sauk City, the shallow 64-acre kettle lake is the centerpiece of Indian Lake County Park, which is one of Dane County\u2019s largest parks at 483 acres. Indian Lake also sits on the boundary between a glaciated and unglaciated landscape. If you are moving westward, the park serves as a gateway to the Driftless Area, a hilly region characterized by the absence of glacial drift. \u201cThe Driftless is an anomaly,\u201d writes conservation biologist Curt Meine. \u201cThrough the recurring episodes of Pleistocene glaciation\u2014seventeen pulses of expansion and shrinkage over two and a half million years\u2014ice hemmed in the Driftless on all sides at one time or another but left its interior ice-free.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Curt Meine, \u201cThe Edge of Anomaly\u201d in <em>Wildness: Relations of People and Place<\/em>, edited by Gavin Van Horn and John Hausdoerffer, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2017, 36.<\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Frederic G.

According to Frederic Cassidy, whose book, Dane County Place-Names, was first published in 1947, the lake was named \u201cfor the Winnebago Indians, who frequented it for hunting and fishing before and for many years after the coming of the whites.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span> The name \u201cIndian L\u201d first appeared on a map in 1873. It was labeled Hororah Lake on a map created in 1838, two years after Wisconsin became a territory.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Today, a sign on the southeast shore provides a brief overview of Indian Lake\u2019s glacial origins. \u201cThe steep slopes of exposed rock indicate that this valley was never completely covered with ice,\u201d the sign reads. \u201cYet the large boulders found in the draws and on the valley floor could only have been brought here by a finger of ice, which fanned out from the main body of the glacier.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shifting from a geologic to human time scale, the sign also notes, \u201cFor several hundred years Indians camped at the southwest end of the lake. During that period, the slopes on this hills above you were quite open and covered with prairie grasses and wildflowers. Frequent fast-moving prairie fires helped keep these areas free of trees. When settlers stopped the fires, trees began to fill in open spaces. Today only a few small patches of prairie remain on the very dry southwest-facing slopes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Erected in 1977, this sign is part of the Dane County Natural History Marker System. The sign differs, albeit subtly, from Dane County and Wisconsin Historical Markers, examples of which can also be found at the park. This particular sign contributes to a pattern among settlers of narrating Indian history within the context of natural history\u2014associating Indigenous peoples with \u201cnature\u201d\u2014that has a similar cumulative effect to other rhetorical strategies like \u201cfirsting\u201d and \u201clasting,\u201d identified by Jean O\u2019Brien, which assert \u201cas a fact the claim that Indians can never be modern.&#8221;<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Jean O\u2019Brien, <em>Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians out of Existence in New England<\/em>, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2010, 107.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although it was named after a group of Winnebago Indians, the lake is associated with a particular Indian, Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak, a Sauk leader more commonly known as Black Hawk, who passed along the shores of Indian Lake one fateful afternoon in July of 1832.<\/p>\n<p>Another sign near a boat landing on the northwest end of Indian Lake, explains the connection between Indian Lake and the Black Hawk War. \u201cOn July 21, 1832, during the Black Hawk War, Sac Indian leader Black Hawk and his band left Pheasant Branch, west of Madison, retreating ahead of the military forces commanded by Colonels Ewing and Dodge. The band fled north following a route past the west end of Indian Lake and turned westward down the broad valley now bisected by Highway 12. The military, despite rain and exhausted horses, managed to catch up to Black Hawk\u2019s warriors late that afternoon at the Heights overlooking the Wisconsin River.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This second sign was erected by the Dane County Historical Society in 1997 to commemorate the 165th anniversary of the so-called war. Apparently it was one of the first of nearly three dozen historical markers installed that summer along the \u201cBlack Hawk Trail\u201d in Wisconsin. A newsletter from the organization notes that the \u201cIndian Lake Passage\u201d sign marks \u201ca portion of the escape route of Black Hawk.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><em>Dane County Historical Society Newsletter<\/em> 26, no. 2 (Summer 2007), 2.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Indian Lake was created by retreating glaciers and is now associated with retreating Indians. Positioned at opposite ends of the glacial lake, the two signs narrate stories of retreat that intersect in unexpected ways, and also resonate with more explicitly colonial place-names such as the tiny towns of Retreat and Victory, Wisconsin, situated near the Mississippi River where the Black Hawk War climaxed in a massacre.<\/p>\n<p>The two signs also tell origin stories\u2014geologic origins and settler origins\u2014stories about deep time and modern time. How are we to make sense of the juxtaposition of these seemingly incommensurable time scales? What happens when a fleeting \u201cpassage\u201d or temporary \u201cencampment\u201d is positioned next to an event\u2014a glacial retreat, in this case\u2014that unfolded over thousands of years? Or for that matter, how does it square with the \u201cmany years\u201d (including up to the present-day) that Ho-Chunk have hunted and fished at Indian Lake? What is the relationship between these inexorable movements and transformative structures? The two signs seem to link deep time and modern time, while cutting out something in between, perhaps \u201ctime immemorial.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If \u201cplaying Indian\u201d is a way for settlers to seize Indigeneity and claim Native land, as historians Phil Deloria and Jean O\u2019Brien have argued, perhaps playing geologist\u2014partly by listening to these common glacial origin stories\u2014is a way of seizing deep time, undercutting 10,000+ years of grounded knowledge and political authority, and rendering Indigenous peoples as immigrants\u2014one part of a \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d\u2014without sovereign claims to the land.<\/p>\n<p>These intersecting origin stories also stretch \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d into the deep past, where glaciers become the original plows that broke the plains. In 1837, geologist Louis Agassiz wrote, \u201cThe glacier was God\u2019s great plough; and when the ice vanished from the face of the land, it left it prepared for the hand of the husbandman.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Louis Agassiz, \u201cIce-Period in America,\u201d <em>The Atlantic Monthly<\/em> 14 (July 1864), 93.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Writing in 1914 about the unfolding revolution in Mexico, B.F.

The winding footpath traces the maximum extent of the Wisconsinan Glaciation, which occurred about 20,000 years ago. For the most part, the trail follows end moraines through Wisconsin, a state that has arguably\u2014at least if you ask a Cheesehead\u2014been sculpted more than any other by the colossal ice sheets of the last Ice Age. The fact that the most recent of the great Ice Ages of the Pleistocene Epoch, which ended only about 10,000 years ago, is named the Wisconsin Glacial Episode or Wisconsinan Glaciation, attests to its profound effects on the landscape that would become in 1848 the State of Wisconsin.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s significant, too, that the name of this glacial episode was derived from the name of a state that in turn was derived from the name of a river that was derived from an Indigenous place-name. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, \u201cWisconsin (originally Meskonsing) is the English spelling of a French version of a Miami Indian name for a river that runs 430 miles through the center of our state, currently known as the Wisconsin River.\u201d The society also declares with conviction, \u201cOur state\u2019s name, supported by geological evidence, means \u2018river running through a red place.\u2019\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>\u201cWisconsin\u2019s Name: Where it Came From and What it Means,\u201d Wisconsin Historical Society, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wisconsinhistory.org\/Records\/Article\/CS3663\">https:\/\/www.wisconsinhistory.org\/Records\/Article\/CS3663<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is another example of projecting settlement backwards into deep time\u2014another example of Glacial Manifest Destiny.

In fact, according to the sign, going in either direction from the junction is WRONG, which seems to foreclose the possibility of taking the one less traveled\u2026Irony aside, the warning sign invites deeper reflection on the many divergences and convergences at Indian Lake County Park, where the Black Hawk Trail overlaps with the Ice Age Trail. There are of course many more layers of history at Indian Lake, including stories of German immigration and settler colonization, but the conjunction of glacial and settler origins stories is what immediately stands out.<\/p>\n<p>Fabu Phillis Carter\u2019s short poem, \u201cMacaja Revels Camped at a Stream of Water,\u201d is not featured on the \u201cPoetry Trail.\u201d Published in 2013 by the former poet laureate of Madison, known professionally as Fabu, \u201cMacaja Revels\u201d is about a young black man, born on the Cherokee Reservation in North Carolina in 1800, who migrated to Dane County.

If the Anthropocene is already here, the question then becomes, what can we do with it as a conceptual apparatus that may serve to undermine the conditions that it names? One could object that by dating the Anthropocene to colonialism we are undoing the critical and creative work that has been done to name the problem of colonialism and its power differentials because the Anthropocene, as a term, erases these questions of power. Indeed, many people in the humanities have pointed out the failure of the Anthropocene, as a concept, to adequately account for power relations. Instead, all humans are equally implicated under the sign of the \u2018anthropos.\u2019 But rather than abandon the term because of these connections, we feel that the Anthropocene betrays itself in its name: in its reassertion of universality, it implicitly aligns itself with the colonial era.

Ostler, for example, connects the war to the \u201cjust and lawful wars\u201d clause in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. \u201cWhen they stated a capacity to crush Black Hawk\u2019s people like a piece of dirt and cause them to cease to exist or when they called for their extermination, government and military officials did not cite the 1787 Northwest Ordinance\u2019s authorization of \u2018just and lawful wars.\u2019 Nonetheless, officials were clearly operating on the assumption, embedded in that foundational legislation, that it was legal and just to prosecute genocidal war against \u2018savages\u2019 who resisted \u2018civilization\u2019s\u2019 demands.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Ostler, Surviving Genocide, 307.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>According to Black Hawk, the 1832 war was precipitated by the 1804 Treaty of St. Louis, which ceded more than 50 million acres of Indigenous land. In his autobiography, published a year after the war, Ma-Ka-Tai-Me-She-Kia-Kiak, or Black Hawk reflected on the ramifications of the treaty and the dubious circumstances surrounding its signing: \u201cThis was all myself and nation knew of the treaty of 1804. It has since been explained to me. I found by that treaty, that all of the country east of the Mississippi, and south of Jeffreon was ceded to the United States for one thousand dollars a year. I will leave it to the people of the United States to say whether our nation was properly represented in this treaty? Or whether we received a fair compensation for the extent of country ceded by these four individuals? I could say much more respecting this treaty, but I will not at this time.

But here the intersection is more oblique. Just outside of town, on the shoulder of Highway 14, a historical marker commemorates the discovery of an American Mastodon skeleton in 1897. The \u201cBoaz Mastodon,\u201d as it has come to be known, was found by farmers \u201csticking out of an eroded bank on a tributary of Mill Creek\u201d after a severe rainstorm. It was the first recorded discovery of mastodon bones in Wisconsin. Mastodons, the marker explains, \u201chad moved into Wisconsin after the last glacial retreat about 13,000 years ago and lived here for the next 4,000 years, when they became extinct. A fluted quartzite spear point found near the bones suggests that humans also arrived in Wisconsin shortly after the glacial retreat and may have hunted these animals for food.\u201d Since 1915, the skeleton has been prominently displayed at the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum. \u201cOur mastodon is our museum\u2019s most iconic fossil and it\u2019s arguably one of the most famous fossils in Wisconsin,\u201d said museum curator Carrie Eaton. \u201cIt is the centerpiece of our skeleton room.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Seth Jovaag, \u201cGeologists Rewrite The Story Of Wisconsin\u2019s Boaz Mastodon,\u201d <em>Wisconsin Life<\/em> (October 28, 2015), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wisconsinlife.org\/story\/geologists-rewrite-the-story-of-wisconsins-boaz-mastodon\/\">https:\/\/www.wisconsinlife.org\/story\/geologists-rewrite-the-story-of-wisconsins-boaz-mastodon\/<\/a><\/span><\/span> It\u2019s unclear what has become of the fluted quartzite spear point, but the passing reference to it\u2014along with a second, slightly less thrilling historical marker in Boaz Community Park\u2014connects glacial and settler origin stories.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":28941,"id":28941,"title":"05WI_06ocooch01 copy","filename":"05WI_06ocooch01-copy.jpg","filesize":518868,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/meskonsing-indian-lake-convergence-1\/05wi_06ocooch01-copy\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Image courtesy the authors","caption":"A historical marker in Boaz, WI.","name":"05wi_06ocooch01-copy","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":28933,"date":"2020-09-30 15:56:19","modified":"2020-09-30 15:57:04","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1051,"height":1577,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy-512x768.jpg","thumbnail-width":512,"thumbnail-height":768,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy-200x300.jpg","medium-width":200,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy-768x1152.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":1152,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy-933x1400.jpg","large-width":933,"large-height":1400,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy-1024x1536.jpg","1536x1536-width":1024,"1536x1536-height":1536,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy.jpg","2048x2048-width":1051,"2048x2048-height":1577,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/05WI_06ocooch01-copy-800x1200.jpg","feature-width":800,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>Erected by the Wisconsin Historical Society in 1998, this Black Hawk War marker is simply entitled, \u201cOcooch Mountains.\u201d The sign doesn\u2019t mark a specific encampment but rather describes the rugged terrain in which the Black Hawk War unfolded\u2014rugged terrain that produced rugged individuals. \u201cDuring the Black Hawk War of 1832,\u201d the sign reads, \u201cBlack Hawk\u2019s band and the pursuing military ventured into this unknown terrain of steep ridges and valleys.

Ocooch also keeps space \u201cpolitically open,\u201d and avoids \u201ca false antagonism that centers and further entrenches the settler imaginary by deflecting attention from foundational tensions between Indigenous peoples and settlers.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Nicholas Brown, \u201cExperiments in Regional Settler-Colonization: Pursuing Justice and Producing Scale through the Montana Study,\u201d in <em>Settler City Limits: Indigenous Resurgence and Colonial Violence in the Urban Prairie West<\/em>, edited by Heather Dorries, Robert Henry, David Hugill, Tyler McCreary, and Julie Tomiak, Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press, 2019, 135.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In a conciliatory essay, \u201cThe View from Man Mound,\u201d Curt Meine suggests that from the man-shaped effigy mound in Sauk County, \u201cwe can look out and see that the history of Wisconsin\u2019s natural and human communities is woven together on Wisconsin\u2019s landscape.\u201d \u201cFrom Man Mound,\u201d he continues, \u201cwe can see ecological change over not just one but multiple temporal thresholds.\u201d Meine concludes by reflecting on contemporary Indigenous\/settler relationships to each other and the land. \u201cAt Man Mound,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe geographies of the ancient Native Americans and recently arrived Euro-Americans intersected.
