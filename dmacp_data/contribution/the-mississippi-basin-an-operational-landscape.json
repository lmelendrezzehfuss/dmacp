But as processes of operationalization intensify in the constant search of profit, the capacities of natural systems to support them are gradually exhausted and need to be compensated through recurring investment and eventual capital intensification: fertilizer inputs substitute the lost fertility of the soil, while constant drainage is required to sustain navigational depth across the waterways. At the same time, efforts to expand this capacity often lead to further degradation. The increased used of herbicides and genetically modified crops leads to the evolution of more resistant \u201csuperweeds\u201d and \u201csuperbugs,\u201d while drainage efforts through tilling lead to increased water pollution, erosion, and sedimentation\u2014all of which require further investment in infrastructure and inputs, in a constant struggle to maintain the operationality of the landscape. A vicious cycle of increasing investment, commodification, and intensification, only to sustain thinning profit margins, lays bare the limits of operationalization, as its consecutive waves exhaust the \u201cecological surplus\u201d of the Mississippi Basin.<\/p>\n<p>As the underlying logic of operationalization is driven by the search for profit, the hyper-productivity of the region yields questionable results. The metabolism of the agroindustrial system offers a lucid example: While agricultural yields continue to rise, the region is barely producing any food. More than 50% of the corn and soy production ends up as animal feed, with its nutritional contribution deteriorating as it flows through the meat processing industry. What is even more striking is that a growing amount of crops is not even part of the food\/feed nexus, but are rather inputs for the biofuel industry. In fact, to a large extent, the Mississippi Basin is turning into an energy landscape, characterized by a quite paradoxical metabolism: as large quantities of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers need to be diffused over the Cornbelt to compensate for the exhausted fertility of the soil, tons of fertilizers are shipped through the Mississippi transport network, from the fertilizer processing and mixing plants that are stitched along it, and which are interwoven with the pipelines providing their main input: natural gas. In this rather absurd cycle, one form of energy (natural gas), is eventually turned into another (biofuel), having been transmitted through nitrogen fertilizers and plants. Moreover, excess nitrogen is \u201creturned\u201d to the riverine system in the form of water pollution, reflected in figure 4. This map overlays nitrogen deposition along the watersheds with the location of natural gas pipelines and fertilizer plants, disclosing this irrational interplay that is facilitated through subsides and regulatory frameworks aiming to address agricultural surpluses and trade crises.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"full","image":[{"ID":25079,"id":25079,"title":"04_Nitrogen","filename":"04_Nitrogen.jpg","filesize":4896843,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/04_Nitrogen.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/04_nitrogen\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Map by Nikos Katsikis","caption":"4.

This seminar is intended to map commodity flows and energy cycles in the Mississippi basin as a whole, to document the relations between extraction, synthesis, and exploitation, and the effects of commodity dependencies across scales.<\/p>\n <p>This seminar is rooted in the idea that the Mississippi watershed is itself a commodity. Its form is dictated by the Appalachia in the East, formed 480 million years ago, and Rocky Mountains in the West, 180 million years ago. This topography creates a basin which governs the path taken by rainwater. The resultant cycle of kinetic energy enables the transport of goods, the generation of power, irrigation, and the accumulation of sediment in southern Louisiana and the Gulf. Along this riverine kinesis, a plethora of industrial sites agglomerate, treating the river as a conveyor, faucet, thermal sink, and waste disposal mechanism. From fertilizers and plastics to sugar, this industrial hydrology maps onto the older economic geography of plantations, reflecting a long and violent history of exploitation of both social and natural systems that continues today, as certain forms of production occur at the expense of human existence and the condition of the natural environment.<\/p>\n<p>To better understand this \u201coperational\u201d landscape, seminar participants will each choose and research a commodity and bring it (or a representation of it) to Campus. Day 1 will begin by sharing, sensing, and arranging these commodities on tables and studying related maps, to explore the relationships between the varied material objects. This classroom experience will be followed by a boat tour on the Mississippi River offered by the Port of New Orleans, to see first-hand the working wharves and docks where plastics, grains, and fuels come and go. In parallel, other seminar participants will learn about the commodification of the city\u2019s Mardi Gras culture.<\/p>\n<p>On the second day, participants will visit the Whitney Museum, the site of a former sugar plantation, to draw out the history of racialized violence upon which commodity production has rested in the region and continues to do so. The appropriation of the work of humans and nature in the region dates back at least to the mid-18th century: Sugar from South East Asia was first planted in New Orleans in 1751. Like cotton, it benefited from the nutritive properties of deposited alluvial soil and the process of photosynthesis. The agricultural knowledge and labor of the enslaved made enormous profits possible. To understand the continued human cost of commodity production, the seminar will also visit the community of St. James Parish, a largely African American community that faces ongoing exposure to the toxic externalities of plastic production. Finally, to further understand the collective consequence of industrial chemistry and its products, participants will visit the largest nitrogen refinery in North America, CF industries in Donaldsonville. Visiting the nitrogen plant allows for the disentanglement of the complex relationships characterizing the agro-energy nexus, with nitrogen production reflecting the intensification of industrial agriculture and the continuing dependence on fossil fuels as well as their negative externalities, both social and environmental. The seminar will also test various relational strategies to enter the plant: exploring nitrate\u2019s integration with our own bodies; using satellite data to map its atmospheric dispersal; and considering its relation to the river and attendant infrastructure. Tracing nitrogen flows will offer one means of mapping the complex feedbacks of an anthropocentric Earth.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Commodity
