Much later come intervals of extreme cold, years of glaciers advancing and retreating, and then finally a melt. Some people on this continent know of the ice from their ancestors\u2019 stories. Now, around 2500 BCE, the Mississippi River is really starting to get going, moving its fresh water and silt down a slow grade, carving and filling land, avulsing into new channels, and dumping successions of sediment loads in lobes of soil that extend into a sea. Small bands of people move through and live on these spits and marshes, gathering shellfish, hunting; some are the predecessors of people who still live here, while others leave only remnants of their occupation in shell middens and mounds. A rich time; buffalo graze all the way down to the gulf. A thousand years from now, in 1540, an adventurer from afar named Hernando de Soto will drift down the Mississippi and leave his remains as well. Another hundred years pass, and the French explorer Robert de La Salle takes his turn to float down the channel. He claims the land, valley, waterways, trees, bayous\u2014all of it and more\u2014for France.<\/p>\n<p>The terms \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d compose the title of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-campus-the-human-delta\/seminar-claims-property\">a seminar<\/a> convened during the November 2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-campus-the-human-delta\/\"><em>Anthropocene River Campus<\/em><\/a> to investigate how cultures of property support, infiltrate, and inform processes of the Anthropocene. This topic emerged from a process of collective analysis and writing at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/midway-meeting-st-louis\"><em>Anthropocene River<\/em><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/midway-meeting-st-louis\"> Midway Meeting<\/a> in St. Louis in the spring of 2019. As seminar conveners, we hoped not only to address land as property but to draw out gray zones of epistemic significance, such as how the practice of property sees all life as its potential object. Indeed, the pervasiveness of property and its sedimentation through both space and time made it difficult to settle on a plan. For one, how were we to pursue a subject that is more social practice than thing? Neither \u201cproperty\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d can be observed as material or infrastructural projects, such as a dam, hospital, prison, or school can. Yet property provides the economic and political underpinnings for such projects\u2014whose benefits are subsequently unevenly distributed.<\/p>\n<p>To think about property is to think about its political predisposition and social effects as part of a broad and subjective variegation of emotional charge. Who is able to have access to or \u201cmake\u201d property, and how, and for what purposes? Claims, whether to territory, speech, or narrative, are likewise enunciated by social subjects and infused by feelings. We needed to encounter the narratives and feelings that generated these claims. But it seemed paralyzing to imagine how, and with whom, especially for those of us who live far from the context of New Orleans. And for some, our identities also mattered, as white people from settler or immigrant ancestries who enjoy advantageous property relations through no efforts of our own. We recognized that contingencies and differences between people are symptomatic of and charged with the full weight of the contradictions and inequities issued in society<em>.<\/em> Our initial conversations hovered on the sticky questions of how the historical making of property has disproportionately negated the existence of some more than others\u2014the same people who suffer environmental vulnerability, and political and economic exclusion. It seemed important, then, to situate our seminar\u2019s practice as one of observing and listening to these experiences, even though imagining such conversations with roughly thirty people beyond our initial convening group (<a href=\"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/morgan-adamson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Morgan Adamson<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/bruce-braun\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bruce Braun<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/ravi-agarwal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ravi Agarwal<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/shana-m-griffin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shana M. griffin<\/a>) seemed overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>We did not want to use the form of a tour, because claims and property, rights and access, are precisely the facts that tourism conceals. An <em>investigation<\/em> <em>into place<\/em> should instead entail learning about the means through which people are able to animate that place to make it home, and the obstacles that prevent that. We decided to explore New Orleans as a territory alongside our hosts, experts, and conveners<em>. <\/em>We leaned heavily on the knowledge, generosity, and affinities of Shana M. griffin, Grace Treffinger, Geneva Leboeuf, Laura Kelley, and Nathan Jessee. We reflexively reframed our questions about property and claims through listening to their experiences, divulged formally and informally, walking, eating, and being together.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":27959,"id":27959,"title":"3.

The Geographies of Black displacement is a multimedia and public history research project that illuminates the systematic dislocation and denigration of New Orleans black populations, from the period of enslavement, through shifting housing policies, to forms of racialized violence and confinement. Shana\u2019s research has informed her work as a housing activist and community organizer. We get to experience this profound project as a guided walk through the oldest areas of New Orleans. We stop first at the bronze statue of Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, the colonialist who founded New Orleans in 1718. The monument, a gift from France, stands in a small park. We consider the trio of figures: Bienville, the tallest, faces the horizon, while beside him his companion, the Augustinian monk Father Athanase, looks down at a bible. At Bienville\u2019s feet sits an unnamed Indigenous man with a feathered pipe in his hands. One looks toward a future, the second to Divine Law, and the third is a cipher.<\/p>\n<p>On the nearby river levee, we take in a new marker installed for the city\u2019s 300-year anniversary.

The plaque continues, \u201cTheir skills and cultural practices were foundational to the development of Louisiana.\u201d The marker cites their origins, humanizing them as cultures, nations: \u201cWolof, Bambara, Mandingo, Fulbe, Nard, Ganga, Kissy, Susu, Mina, Fon, Yoruba, Chamba, Hausa, Igbo, Ibibio, Kongo\/Angola, Makwa.\u201d They were, the panel says, cargo, \u201cunloaded here on the banks of the Mississippi River.\u201d Shana mentions that the ships could be smelled two weeks before arrival because of the conditions on board.

In 1803, having failed to stop the revolution in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), France sold its continental territories to the United States. Settler agriculture expanded into these ancestral homes of the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), and other nations, who were forced to move elsewhere. Some found their way to the bayous of Louisiana. Meanwhile, three technological advances transformed agriculture: the steamboat, the cotton gin, and granulated sugar processing. Together, they intensified the demand for unfree labor. In 1804, Haiti became an independent nation, and nearly 10,000 Haitian refugees, including sugar planters, enslaved people, and free Blacks, migrated to New Orleans.<\/p>\n<p>Four years later, in 1808, the United States abolished the international slave trade. This gave rise to a domestic market known as the \u201csecond middle passage.\u201d Enslaved black people were transported up and down river by boat, or even forced to walk from Virginia or the Carolinas to New Orleans markets. In 1812, Louisiana became a state. Eventually, 400 plantations were established between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, giving rise to the highest concentration of millionaires in the United States. By 1820, the city was the biggest market for slaves in the country. Sales took place in private homes, on street corners, inside banks, insurance companies, schools, and hospitals. \u201cSlavery, sex, and sugar\u201d became New Orleans\u2019s primary tourist attractions. Shana conjures this past through her incantation of the everyday. Partying tourists cruise by us as we look for traces of slave quarters along the side of an old building. These were tiny rooms where enslaved people were quartered when an owner stayed in the city. The cubicles were situated close to the slaveowners\u2019 apartments, and they could enter any time for any reason. We visit buildings with markers indicating that they were used for selling humans. Shana points out how the spaces and the laws that controlled the movement of enslaved people are the templates for contemporary carceral systems, and how the city\u2019s architecture reveals these spaces of confinement for those who look. Between 1804 and 1862, around 135,000 people were bought and sold in New Orleans. This number does not account for the unquantifiable \u2013 the love, kinship, and stability that was destroyed, and continues to haunt the present.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27996,"id":27996,"title":"IMG_1051","filename":"IMG_1051-scaled.jpg","filesize":521408,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/img_1051\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Photo by Sara Black","caption":"Shana M. griffin talks to seminar participants in New Orleans' French Quarter, pointing how the city\u2019s architecture reveals spaces of confinement\u2014a legacy of slavery\u2014for those who look.","name":"img_1051","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-08-06 15:10:01","modified":"2020-08-07 12:25:44","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1920,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-768x576.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":576,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-300x225.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":225,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-768x576.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":576,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-1400x1050.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":1050,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-1536x1152.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1152,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-2048x1536.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1536,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_1051-1600x1200.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>Due to New Orleans\u2019s Catholic provenance, the city had also customs that made slavery look different than elsewhere in the U.S. Enslaved people had Sundays off, and, intermittently according to policy changes, the right to earn their own money. Although white lawmakers attempted to control the practice, affluent Blacks could sometimes purchase their family members. In 1812, free people of color began buying parcels of land from Claude Trem\u00e9, who had inherited a retired plantation through his wife, Julie Moreau, who, as a woman, could not own property. The district named after Trem\u00e9, often referred to as the oldest neighborhood of free people of color in the U.S., served as a site of economic, cultural, political, social, and legal events that shaped the struggles of people of African descent in the South and across the United States. Trem\u00e9 was home to some of the city\u2019s most successful and talented black artisans, craftsmen, musicians, doctors, teachers, writers, revolutionary abolitionists, and activists. Today, some residents still live in houses built by their ancestors. <em>The New Orleans Tribune<\/em>, the first black daily newspaper in the U.S., was started by physician and publisher Louis Charles Roudanez, a resident of Trem\u00e9. During the Reconstruction era following the American Civil War, the residents of Trem\u00e9 and other neighborhoods engaged in advocacy efforts in the city and across the state to expand civil rights protections, increase access to schools, public institutions, employment opportunities, and integrated transportation systems.\u00a0 Once Reconstruction ended, and federal troops withdrew, Jim Crow laws reversed the gains Black residents had achieved in terms of equality, wealth access, legislative representation, and dignity.<\/p>\n<p>Our tour continues on the edge of Trem\u00e9, where Bienville Basin, a new \u201cmixed-income\u201d housing complex, has been fashioned from the destruction of an older low-income project, Iberville Public Housing.

Starting in the 1930s, integrated neighborhoods like the Trem\u00e9 began to be torn down through policies of slum clearance, and people were relocated from their familiar neighborhoods and into segregated public housing. The intersectional social bonds that characterized their former neighborhoods were torn apart. The houses that still stood suffered from neglect because investment redlining practices made it impossible for owners and new buyers to get loans. Shana describes to us four different \u201curban renewal\u201d projects in the Trem\u00e9 that have uprooted families and destroyed social cohesion. When Interstate 10 was built in the late 1960s, more homes were lost and 500 businesses had to close. I read that hundreds of ancient oak trees lining Claiborne Street, which led to the freeway, were uprooted and carried away. Reflecting beyond Shana\u2019s account of systematic localized forms of displacement, and guided by Fullilove\u2019s analysis, I imagine how New Orleans would have been impacted by the regressive policies of Reagan\u2019s 80s.

are traveling to Terrebonne Parish to meet with Geneva Lebeouf and the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe. The roads get smaller until we reach a long bayou lined with small houses, trawlers, and packing sheds. We find the tribal community center, an insulated Quonset hut\u2013style building on tall piers, and climb up into a light-filled lodge and the exquisite smell of cooking food. In back, a kitchen bustles with people chatting and cooking. Geneva, who facilitated this meeting, greets us and describes the wonderful dishes they have made from seafood caught by tribal members: Shrimp opelousas, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, gumbo, and Brenda\u2019s famous baked fish. There is palpable pride in the room for the research they\u2019ve been doing into their heritage. The walls are covered with maps, informational posters, photographs, and books. Geneva introduces Theresa and Donald Dardar, Mary Verdin, Brenda Billiot, Christine Verdin, Earl Billiot, and others who have come for the gathering. We also meet Laura Kelley, a historian from Tulane who has worked with the tribe for over five years, bringing students to document oral histories and traditional knowledge\u2014crucial archival work that will contribute toward the tribe\u2019s bid for federal recognition.<\/p>\n<p>For generations, the Pointe-au-Chien have shrimped, crabbed, fished, trapped, and hunted for subsistence, supplemented by grazing beef cattle, foraging herbs and fruits, and cultivating gardens. Today, many members are also commercial fishers, boat pilots, and schoolteachers. Their tools are contemporary\u2014shrimp boats, seine nets, crab pots, and the internet\u2014but they are still bound by kinship to each other and the littoral landscape. Geneva describes for us the tribal governance and her current role in it; as part of the membership committee, she studies the genealogies of people associated with the tribe. To be a member, one\u2019s parents or grandparents must have lived in Terrebonne Parish in both 1940 and 1960. This interval of residency takes into account the flooding that has periodically displaced folks to other locations. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in our community who have moved to higher ground,\u201d Geneva says. \u201cBut they always move back.\u201d After introductions, we get to the delicious food, eating in small groups to hear stories about our hosts\u2019 children, fishing, tribe, and home.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27971,"id":27971,"title":"15. 099A8447_SD","filename":"15.-099A8447_SD-scaled.jpg","filesize":869593,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/15-099a8447_sd\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Photo by Sarrah Danziger","caption":"The Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe\u2019s community center in Terrebonne Parish.","name":"15-099a8447_sd","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-08-06 13:59:27","modified":"2020-08-07 12:29:32","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1707,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-1536x1024.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-2048x1365.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/15.-099A8447_SD-1600x1067.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>We join Geneva behind the community center to see open water where there once was solid ground. They say land is lost at the rate of a football field every hundred minutes\u2014a new increment of time to measure the velocities of change in the Anthropocene. Land disappears on a daily basis to erosion and subsidence, which is then exacerbated by storms and rising sea levels. The changes can be traced to policies that unleashed slow-moving, positive feedback loops of unnatural disaster, such as the Swamp Land Acts of 1849 and 1850, which turned federal wetlands over to states for agricultural use. Nathan Jessee, a PhD candidate studying the relocation process of the Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe, explains how those acts were \u201ccentral to Louisiana making property out of this \u2018uninhabitable swampland\u2019 and setting the stage for private property development and extractive industries to come in.\u201d In Louisiana, nine million acres of mixed wetlands were auctioned off for less than a dollar an acre, snapped up for timber and oil. Every canal that has ever been dredged through the swamp for logging, pipelines, construction, and exploration persists like an open wound, one that increases vulnerability to storm surges, hurricanes, erosion, and salt inundation. Every barrel of pumped oil augments the metabolic intensity at which the transformation proceeds. The engineering of the Mississippi River has also played a role\u2014\u201cstraightjacketing it,\u201d Laura Kelley says, referring to the leveeing and shortening of the river that eliminated the surges of sediment that once built land. The constitution and ecology of the water itself is changing; Geneva says the water was never salty enough for dolphins before. And the introduction of new compounds, such as Corexit 9500A, the solvent used after the BP oil spill in 2010, has intervened in the reproduction cycles of crabs and oysters.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"embed","title":"","embed":"<iframe title=\"Claims\/Property, Geneva Lebeouf\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/445513791?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","caption":"Geneva Lebeouf introduces the bayou as home, with its infrastructures for fishing, crabbing and shrimping, and the resting place of the Point-au-Chien Tribe\u2019s ancestors.

The recent installation of a new levee, lock and floodgate system part of a larger project to protect Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes from storms, will benefit the Pointe-au-Chien community. In contrast, the nearby Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe, who live outside of the levee system, has been preparing to relocate for almost two decades.<\/p>\n<p>Our bus crosses the levee via the two-lane Island Road, surrounded by open water dotted with oil and gas pipelines and pumping stations, and enters Isle de Jean Charles, a long strip of land with a smattering of homes belonging to tribal members. Since the 1950s, the band has lost 98 percent of their ancestral land, and now inhabits only a remnant\u2014a narrow spit surrounded by water. As with the Pointe-au-Chien, many families from Isle de Jean Charles have moved inland due to the extreme flooding, but in this case, it\u2019s clear they will never be able to move back. After undergoing a long-term study and design process, the Isle de Jean Charles band Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe applied for and was awarded a Federal grant for resettlement due to climate change- the first such community in the United States. They call their resettlement \u201ca living and active bridge from our ancestral Island, which is rapidly eroding, to a sustainable future.\u201d The new inland site will include a community center, seed library, museum, gathering areas, and housing to bring the tribe together around cultural regeneration. But the involvement of federal money has brought complications; we learned from Nathan, that there is uncertainty as to how and whether the ambitious resettlement will be accomplished without eroding the tribe\u2019s ability to retain self-determination over their own future.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":27972,"id":27972,"title":"16. 099A8539_SD","filename":"16.-099A8539_SD-scaled.jpg","filesize":238896,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/16-099a8539_sd\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Photo by Sarrah Danziger","caption":"Driving along Island Road, toward Isle de Jean Charles.","name":"16-099a8539_sd","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-08-06 14:00:01","modified":"2020-08-07 12:29:20","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1707,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-1536x1024.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-2048x1365.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/16.-099A8539_SD-1600x1067.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>The bus cruises to a pier at the end of the strip, turns around and heads back toward Island Road and Point-au-Chien. Scattered among the low-lying wood-frame residences of tribal members are houses that were built more recently by what Geneva and Laura call \u201cweekend warriors.\u201d We also saw these vacation outposts on Bayou Pointe-au-Chien.\u00a0 Built on land purchased by outsiders, they are better maintained, well equipped with recreational toys, and stand higher off the ground. Geneva is irked by the weekend warriors. I witness her annoyance and try to make sense of it. Returning to the pier at Pointe-au-Chien, Geneva gestures toward an island that is home to the ancient mounds and burial sites of their ancestors. For the Pointe-au-Chien Tribe, the history and life of their territory has its own claims on them, to which they are accountable. The weekend warriors have the luxury of a vacation retreat to use for a few days of hunting and fishing with the boys. It barely constitutes a relationship, for they have no responsibility to the place, which in turn has no claims on them. For the Pointe-au-Chien, to maintain material relations with place and each other includes attending to the needs of the ecosystem. Last year, the tribe obtained a grant and organized volunteers to construct a massive artificial barrier reef of oyster shells to protect the ancestral mounds. The reef will also provide surfaces for oyster spat to attach to and develop on. To be cared for by place obligates reciprocity, in this case for ancestors and oyster kin.<\/p>\n<p>Both the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe and the Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe are legally recognized by Louisiana state as unique tribal peoples with long histories in this region. They are both currently immersed in the application process for federal recognition, a notoriously difficult process that can take as long as 30 years. To be acknowledged as a tribe on the federal level, they must compile detailed evidence of their membership, genealogies, treaties, language, and governance for each decade of the twentieth century. The application takes the form of a narrative drawn from maps, diaries, letters, oral histories, and other archival materials. The coveted designation of federal recognition make a tribe eligible for multiple support services and grants.\u00a0 While there is no equivalency between what Indigenous Peoples have lost and the assistance available through federal recognition, the acknowledgment process at least affords tribes access to resources that may mitigate historic harms. It can support them in transitioning the climate catastrophe and increase their capacities to thrive in the next times.<\/p>\n<p>For Black Americans, there is no application for the restitution of property they were swindled out of or forced to relinquish, or for the countless hours of stolen labor that augmented the wealth of others. There is no administrative process through which Black people can be aided in the restoration of languages and lost cultures. There is no recognition process that makes them eligible for reparations. Author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates writes in his essay about reparations that \u201cwe find the roots of American wealth and democracy \u2026 in the for-profit destruction of the most important asset available to any people, the family. The destruction was not incidental to America\u2019s rise; it facilitated that rise.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Ta-Nehisi Coates, \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d in <em>The Atlantic<\/em>, June 2014.<\/span><\/span><\/span> Though there is currently no process for calculating reparations like the one used to recognize indigenous loss, the recognition process could be reconfigured to account for and become a witness to the unseen deprivation that underpins property.<\/p>\n<p>While identity is performed through and in place amid processes of living with place, making property is a violent and arbitrary operation inevitably drawn from European-colonial cultural mores of domination, individualism, and hierarchical entitlement. When Robert de La Salle claimed the Mississippi River Valley for France, he preemptively dismissed prior claims of other human and beyond-human inhabitants who already were using the land for their own purposes. When petroleum companies availed themselves of the marshes auctioned following the Swamp Act, they set cascades of devastation in motion\u2014the side effects of progress.<\/p>\n<p>Each of us is impacted by these side effects; they reach us through the mediums of air and water, and the effects of weather and infrastructure. They are embedded in the quotidian and the necessary; in access to food, housing, health, protection, community, and mobility. They surface as policy through the working of capital and as its externalities, and yet, they touch us differentially, in line with our identities, family histories and life trajectories.\u00a0 For two days, thirty-odd people have listened to the experiences of our guides. Being in proximity with each other on long bus rides and straggling walks, there has been time for introspection, sensing, conversation, reflection, and comparison. Who are our kin? Where do our reciprocal relationships lie? What infrastructures do we rely upon? How did we come to the place where we live, and through what stakes, claims, and losses? What are our \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d? We may share an understanding of property\u2019s injustices under capitalism, but we do not equally share their consequences.<\/p>\n<p>After two days of itinerancy, the seminar gathers in a large room to exchange impressions regarding how property is defined, made and unmade. Breakout groups grapple with the contradictions within ownership\u2019s promise of stability given the realities of dispossession. How might we configure relations that are founded upon mutual social responsibility, rather than upon forms of ownership that sever the lives of others?<\/p>\n<p>One group, meditating on the origins of property in possessive individualism, plays with the idea of \u201cmultiplying the subject,\u201d coming up with \u201cpossessive collectivism\u201d as, perhaps, a scaling up of the community land trust<em>.<\/em> I was thinking of this when I started this essay, but misremembered their term as \u201ccollective possession,\u201d which I thought of in the sense of a <em>possession by beyond-humans<\/em>, who could be either allies or demons, ancestors, or an ecosystem, a possession from outside the subject, that goes two ways. I imagined the reshaping of possession as multivalenced, having neither owned nor owner, but guided by a jurisprudence of reciprocity and radical equality.<\/p>\n<p>Before we had arrived in Terrebonne Parish, environmental photographer Ravi Agarwal had asked us to think about protocol <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/lost-voices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as we enter the space of another<\/a>. What attitudes were we coming with, what it is that we might take, and what it is that we might give in return? In our seminar wrap, Shana offered the idea of witnessing as an act of reciprocity. This is because witnessing takes labor. It takes commitment and energy to consider the circumstances of another. Perhaps this modest starting place can be the beginning of another kind of journey. In their performance work <em>Viewing Hours<\/em> (2019), Mayfield Brooks speaks about the unredeemed labor of witnessing:<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\"> Mayfield Brooks, <em>Viewing Hours<\/em>, October 30, 2019.

This seminar engages the complicated entanglements of property claims that cut across the social, racial, and ecological landscapes of the Mississippi Delta, while connecting them to upriver struggles, as well as to the meaning of the Anthropocene itself.<\/p>\n <p>The practices of controlling land and water inherent to property ownership are also tools of the Anthropocene, the effects of which intersect historical and contemporary conflicts over land and property down the length of the Mississippi. This is particularly true in the Delta, where flooding, intrusion, and efforts to reclaim land can\u2019t be separated from the attachments, needs, and claims of specific communities. This seminar examines claims to land amid the shifting registers of property within an intertidal landscape, where fluid dynamics of river and tide literally undermine land through processes that necessitate constant engineering and vigilance.<\/p>\n<p>Capital also exerts deterritorializing force on communities throughout the Delta as slow violence: real estate speculation triggers gentrification and displacement; petro-chemicals migrate into marginalized frontline bodies; ecosystems degrade. Such slippages between land, property, capital, and claims result in a contested ground where definitions and designations shift, impacted by tidal cycles of neoliberal governance; buffered by community organizing, agency, and resistance. In this destabilized environment, who claims care for particular lands, on what basis, and how? How do legacies of settler colonialism and slavery live on in property claims, conflicts, and contradictions? What role does (anthropogenic) environmental change play in casting property\/ownership into a different light? Conversely, are there risks in moving \u201cbeyond\u201d property when marginalized communities claim land as property in the face of dispossession? As with any effort to locate an \u201cotherwise\u201d in or to the present, who is empowered to do so is often unequal and how we ask questions is never innocent.<\/p>\n<p>The seminar is structured around critical site visits in and around New Orleans that magnify contestations over the designation, control, or condition of land. It is informed by local researchers and activists, beginning with the Geographies of Black Displacement tour led by convener Shana M. griffin. This brings into view post-Katrina gentrification and black displacement; the paradox of real estate capital flooding into an area threatened by sea-level rise; a perspective aligning climate change, property, race, and class.<\/p>\n<p>Subsequently, a field visit with the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe (PACIT) will take the seminar about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans, deep in the bayous and swamplands of unclear and rapidly changing boundaries between land and water along the coast. Geneva Lebeouf, Christine Verdin, and PACIT members will guide an exploration down Island Road to the thin strip of land where the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe are facing the existential threat and urgency of sea-level rise that is causing them to consider the loaded possibility of relocating from their ancestral lands. Over a meal together, generously prepared by Tribal members at the PACIT Community Center, the region will be reflected together and experiences of rapid land loss, subsidence, the impacts of oil and gas industries, and strategies of adaptation to these changes in the landscape and frequent flooding events will be discussed.<\/p>\n<p>These shifting landscapes of inundation and chemical trespass, as well as zones of multi-species inhabitation, serve as a provocation to (private) property\u2019s political and economic organizing principle and to the liberal sense of self (\u201cproperty in self\u201d). The final session provides opportunity to develop imaginative scenarios and potential forms of resistance rooted in the nuances of situations observed.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar:
