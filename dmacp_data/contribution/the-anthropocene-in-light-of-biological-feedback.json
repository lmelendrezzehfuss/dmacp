A property of a homeostatic system is resilience, meaning (for our purposes) the ability of the system to buffer external perturbations, and to come back to its internal state. When looking at living organisms, one can see that the number of components involved in this response can play a role in maintaining homeostasis. At an evolutionary level, natural selection is the external perturbation to which species are subjected. We can try to look to the system \u201cbiological species\u201d as a whole, complex system, composed of individuals, which are the result of other \u201ccomponents\u201d (the biological processes). What we call genetic redundancy (that is, the fact that several genes have redundant functions, i.e. are implied in producing similar-working \u201ccomponents,\u201d such as enzymes catalyzing the same reaction) could be seen as a buffering mechanism: the absence of a single gene usually will not lead to major defects, because other \u2012 redundant \u2012 genes or pathways will compensate for the loss. While this applies within a given generation, it also has consequences across generations and in evolution: redundancy is buffering the action of natural selection, notably by limiting the impact of mutations on essential biological functions. One may call this phenomenon \u201cspecies homeostasis.\u201d Incidentally, this is probably one of the main sources of complexity in biology, explaining why biologist are unlikely to be able to \u201cfix a radio,\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Yuri Lazebnik, \u201cCan a biologist fix a radio?

Complexity promotes homeostasis, and, in turn, homeostasis allows the maintenance of complexity. Such reciprocity is also a major driving force for evolution, as defective actors in a given context can become selective advantages when external conditions change. For instance, while sickle cell anemia can be a major health problem, it also provides resistance to malaria, notably through the overproduction of an enzyme called heme oxygenase 1.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Ana Ferreira et al., \u201cSickle hemoglobin confers tolerance to Plasmodium infection,&#8221; <em>Cell<\/em>, vol. 145, no. 3 (2011): pp. 398\u2012409.<\/span><\/span> Therefore, with homeostasis and the maintenance of complexity comes adaptability. This also means that homogeneity and simplification, in contrast, may lead to a reduction in homeostasis, and thus more chaotic and unpredictable behaviors. A landmark of the Anthropocene is precisely this simplification. Satellite images of vast open fields illustrate how humans have switched to homogeneous crop cultivation following the precepts of an \u201cagro-Taylorism\u201d (see also \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Imaging the Anthropocene<\/a>\u201d). Thus, either consciously or unconsciously, we have decided to loose a form of adaptability, at a larger scale than ever before. Because of this global simplification, we may have become more vulnerable to external perturbations.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<h1>Homeostasis also emerges from feedback mechanisms<\/h1>\n<p>While redundancy appears an effective means to reach resilience, it also has limits. In particular, the idea that a set of factors leads to similar outputs is over-simplistic. For instance, while building a high-rise, it seems reasonable that a team of engineers and architects is checking for errors. However, at each step of the construction, despite the expertise of personnel, mechanical tests are conducted to control the structural integrity of the building; in other words, the building itself contributes to the next decision during the process of its own construction. This means that in addition to redundancy, resilience also emerges from feedback systems. While in the case of constructing a building, the architects\u2019 initial decisions would dominate over the contribution made by the building in the final design, obviously this is radically different in a biological system. Biology, and homeostasis in biology, cannot be understood without taking into account such feedback. In fact, if we had to postulate the absence of feedback mechanisms in biology, this would mean that every single molecule (or group of similar molecules) has been positioned following a carefully drawn plan, and that it is blind to its environment. Because one of the main features of molecules is that they interact with one another, and thus are highly dependent on their direct environment, this view, of course, is completely wrong. Biological organisms are complex systems, and this means that they are built on the interactions between molecules, cells, and tissues. This implies that feedback occurs at every scale in this context.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>For an interesting comparison between feedback mechanisms in biology and the theory of relativity, see Johannes Jaeger et al., \u201cRegulative feedback in pattern formation: towards a general relativistic theory of positional information,\u201d <em>Development<\/em>, vol. 135 (2008): pp. 3175\u201283.<\/span><\/span> In fact, feedback in biology does not stop at the scale of the organism, but also includes the habitat, which in the frame of the Anthropocene is probably the most relevant level.<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, while redundancy allows some resilience, homeostasis primarily relies on interactions, and thus feedback systems.

The system used very simple physical laws to self-control the amount of steam entering the machine. The \u201cflyball\u201d at the same time was connected mechanically both to the movement generated by the steam engine and to the valve that allowed the steam to enter the engine. Because of the steam engine movement, the \u201cflyball\u201d was rotating on itself. When the movement was too fast, the flyballs started to move upwards because of the increased kinetic energy, activating a system to reduce the aperture of the valve, thus allowing less steam to enter the engine, and in this way reducing the machine\u2019s speed. Eventually, the flyballs returned to their initial position until a new self-regulation occurred.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>How a Flyball or Centrifugal Governor Works (2012),<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HS_YGZXP2xY&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> online animation <\/a>(accessed 11\/06\/2015).<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Later on, the concept of feedback became central in the discipline of cybernetics, founded by Norbert Wiener.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>\u201cCybernetics,\u201d<em> Encyclopedia Britannica<\/em> (2015), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/cybernetics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online<\/a> (accessed 01\/25\/2015).<\/span><\/span> The question of control and the way that complex systems organize themselves goes back to the mechanisms allowing such organization, and most particularly feedback mechanisms.

This protein is secreted as an inactive form, called pepsinogen. When pepsinogen reaches the stomach lumen, a small sub-part is cleaved, and the remaining protein becomes pepsin, the active enzyme. The positive feedback lies in the step of pepsinogen cleavage: the enzyme responsible for this step is pepsin itself. In other words, pepsin synthesis requires pepsin. This mechanism ensures compartmentalization of protein degradation domains (pepsin would also digest the internal content of the cell was it not synthesized and secreted as an inactive precursor) and this example illustrates one property of positive feedback: positive feedback reinforces a starting trend. In the case of pepsinogen and pepsin, feedback ensures a rapid start to digestion by amplification of the enzymatic capacities.<\/p>\n<p>This is of course one of the defining points of the Anthropocene: the \u201cGreat Acceleration,\u201d a period of growth-amplification for all sectors, is typically the result of a positive feedback loop. As shown in biology, and because of their amplifying power, such positive feedback mechanisms are able to generate major changes from very subtle fluctuations. This also means that fluctuations should not be considered white noise: they can trigger positive feedback, potentially leading to complete chaos. This threat is one of the reasons why the Anthropocene attracts so much attention.<\/p>\n<p>As biological systems are relatively far from behaving chaotically (for instance, similar shapes are maintained in a given species and across generations), positive feedback must be channeled in living organisms. As shown in all biological systems, negative feedback systems usually take over to stop the spirals fueled by positive feedback. For instance, the increase in body temperature brought on by fever is an effective way to increase the efficiency of enzymes, which work sub-optimally at 37 \u00b0C, and work optimally at 38 or 39 \u00b0C. Anyone who has experienced fever also knows about the sweating that accompanies it. Perspiration keeps the fever under control by cooling the body, in a negative feedback loop. Ultimately, providing the sickness is benign, this negative feedback loop will prevail and body temperature will stabilize back to 37 \u00b0C. As in biology, one of the keys to the Anthropocene is to identify such positive and negative feedback loops, in order to understand and anticipate the future trajectory of our environment, and our society.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<h1>Framing the contribution of humans in Earth homeostasis<\/h1>\n<p>Such simple biological feedback is so easy to grasp that even intuitive predictions can be made quite safely.

Some practical solutions to current environmental threats and Anthropocenic challenges have already emerged. For instance, geoengineering strategies are envisioned to mitigate the greenhouse gas effects on the atmospheric temperature. In that scenario, the boundaries of human organisms, in fact, would extend to that of the planet and its atmosphere, shortcutting a large number of intermediates. Importantly, this reduction in complexity also implies that the number of potential buffering mechanisms would be reduced. Here comes the question: Is this global simplification concerning our interaction with the environment not a major tipping point in our evolution and maybe one of the most emblematic landmarks of the Anthropocene? Here, biology stresses that such simplification would be extremely harmful to the planet\u2019s homeostasis.<\/p>\n<p>With the increase of the human impact on the planet, not only has our environment deteriorated, but also its dynamic has been modified dramatically. Fluctuations occur faster, meaning that feedback is less predictable and may be more difficult to channel. If the impact of humanity on the environment is starting to have a dominant effect on Earth, this may hinder the buffering effect of a more balanced complex system. This could be one of the many definitions of the Anthropocene: an era where ecosystem homeostasis is threatened by one of its dominating elements, humanity, and thus a time when the ecosystem becomes vulnerable and to some extent unpredictable, because both humanity and its environment cannot be decoupled anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond technology and Earth sciences, one of the most fascinating research subjects for the future is the contribution of human psychology in our relationship to Earth. In this respect, an understudied subject within the frame of the Anthropocene is the process of decision-making. In general, humans tend to take a conservative approach; when it is time to decide between two options, the conservative option, i.e. the one that is consistent with the past context, is the more likely to be picked. Such conservatism has been largely demonstrated, whether it relates to buying habits or maintaining relationships.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Robert-Vincent Joule, <em>Petit trait\u00e9 de manipulation \u00e0 l\u2019usage des honn\u00eates gens<\/em>.

In the context of the Anthropocene, such a strong bias in decision-making should be included, because it would have a major impact on the evolution of the planet, and thus on humanity indirectly.<\/p>\n<p>Another field in which it is crucial to explore anthropocenic feedback mechanisms is that of education. One may expect that with better knowledge of environmental issues, humanity as a whole will decide to stay away from consumerism, which is one, if not the main, cause of the Anthropocene (also called \u201cCapitalocene\u201d to reflect its economic roots). Consistent with this scenario, sustainable development strategies, alternative modes of consumption and financing, are blooming everywhere: Is this enough to generate a positive feedback loop on education and to amplify this change in human civilization? Two critical points should be raised here. Sustainable development will remain an oxymoron, and thus a marketing trick, as long as development remains within the framework of unlimited economic growth. Second, the worldwide shortage of resources is fueling tensions between countries, and this, in turn, may rapidly hinder current educational efforts. In other words, are we going to change our civilization fast enough to overcome this negative feedback on education?<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the Earth as a complex system, where multiple feedback loops occur, means that it may also be time to consider our planet as a third party to which we are accountable.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Michel Serres, <em>Le temps des crises<\/em>. Paris: Editions le Pommier, 2009.<\/span><\/span> An immediate consequence of this change of paradigm is that any economic transactions would be weighed up in light of what the planet can or cannot offer, including the various feedback loops, and taking into account the long-term implications. Putting a price on nature, however, is a tricky task (see \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-valuing-nature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Valuing Nature<\/a>\u201d). This can be illustrated by the carbon-quota debate, and the associated risk of deadweight loss. Nevertheless, this is probably where our efforts could be focused. Re-scaling the human\u2012environment nexus, investigating the many implications behind the complexity of our world, considering the psychological and temporal limits of human nature, all of these considerations might help to forecast upcoming feedback outcomes, and their surprises.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3057,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:13","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:13","post_content":"","post_title":"Enrico Costanzo","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"enrico-costanzo","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:02:09","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:02:09","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/enrico-costanzo\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/enrico-costanzo\/","acf":{"first_name":"Enrico","last_name":"Costanzo"}},{"ID":3255,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:30","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:30","post_content":"","post_title":"Olivier Hamant","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"olivier-hamant","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-16 16:45:56","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-16 14:45:56","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/olivier-hamant\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/olivier-hamant\/","acf":{"first_name":"Olivier","last_name":"Hamant"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20703,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:44:47","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:44:47","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biosphere has budded off a second global \u201csphere,\u201d the technosphere, a technology-based system on which humans now depend\u2014and which they find hard to control.

As an emergent system, it modulates the conditions of the Earth\u2019s surface, its evolution over time including major innovations such as photosynthesis and the emergence of animals. This dynamic has become more complex with the appearance of the technosphere. In one view the latter is less a conscious construct than an emergent system which humans no longer fully control, with dynamics partly modulated by human actions and needs, and partly by the serendipitous emergence and spread of system-altering components such as computers and their unintended consequences. The technosphere\u2014which like the biosphere is a means to collect, transform, and store energy and matter\u2014co-evolves to maintain itself and appropriate more of the Earth\u2019s surface and materials. Alternatively the technosphere may be viewed as a socio-epistemic, i.e. a knowledge-based system, embodying a fundamental dilemma: individual actions are controlled by thought, while collective actions are controlled by institutions that contain shared knowledge, but cannot think, while participating individuals do not necessarily realize the consequences of collective action. This, together with the limited co-evolutionary dynamics of its epistemic component, lies at the root of the uncontrollability of the technosphere. Collective actions can reach global scale, affecting human survival, with knowledge-production still determined locally.
