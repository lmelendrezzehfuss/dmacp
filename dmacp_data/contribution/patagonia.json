Indigenous communities had neither fences marking private property nor nations in the Western sense. Their houses were temporary tents. When Magellan sighted these lands for the first time in 1520, he saw \u201cnothing but footprints.\u201d Because of their large feet covered by guanaco skins, Magellan referred to the Tehuelches as \u201cPatagones\u201d (big feet), a name that has been used since then for the entire region. Rather than enjoying a peaceful coexistence, the indigenous people were displaced from the territory, threatened by civilization and large livestock enterprises, as Alberto Maria de Agostini wrote in 1945:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Today civilization, with all its modern improvements, has rapidly invaded the vast Patagonian plains, populating them with thousands of sheep, laying roads, and building farms and villages, it is hard to remember that these same plains, a few decades ago, belonged entirely to those famous giant indigenous peoples [Tehuelches].<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Alberto Mar\u00eda de Agostini, Andes Patag\u00f3nicos: Viajes de Exploraci\u00f3n a la Cordillera Patag\u00f3nica Austral.

Currently, Patagonia is promoted as a pristine and immutable landscape in the tourist discourse. The artwork \u201cHaving a Gate\u201d by Holzapfel challenges this assumption. By reproducing a fence, the human intervention in the territory reveals itself, bringing recognition to the disenfranchisement of indigenous people. The landscape is no longer merely natural. It is a cultural and contested space, alerting us to one of the major questions of the Anthropocene, the now obsolete difference between nature and culture.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3264,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:30","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:30","post_content":"","post_title":"Paz Guevara","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"paz-guevara","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:32:09","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:32:09","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/paz-guevara\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/paz-guevara\/","acf":{"first_name":"Paz","last_name":"Guevara"}}],"projects":[{"ID":23331,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2014-11-23 10:34:56","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 09:34:56","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">Contributions and exercises that approach the motif of the fence as the calligraphy of humanity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n  <p>Fences fulfill many different functions.
