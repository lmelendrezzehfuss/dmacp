I think of frictionless, liquid movement, of moving onward without effort, my limbs melting into the surrounding momentum, my body fluently aligning with the bodies next to me as we are carried along. Flowing seems to be not so much an act as a state of being, a state that requires some surrender to another energy, like nature, collectivity, or gravity. Some things are compelled to flow, like blood, time, oxygen, rivers, tears. But while some things appear to flow naturally, flowing is never straightforward. Its ease rests on labors, past and present; its current contains fractures and frictions in the form of turbulences. Take the Mississippi River, for example. It flows in specific ways because of geological formations, weather events, and ongoing interventions by the US Army Corps of Engineers, including dredging and damming, that have altered the river\u2019s basin. The flow continues among eddies and interventions, but all the time it changes, too.<\/p>\n<p>I fell into this journey and went with the flow. I had wanted to write about maize\u2014maize as a \u201cmodel\u201d organism for industrial agriculture as well as genomic sciences and, more generally, for data-intensive evidence practices. I think it makes for an opportune companion for thinking about this time that some are calling the Anthropocene, because maize has developed with people and lands, and these lands and people have developed with maize. Enormous swaths of land in the Midwestern United States along the Mississippi River have been reconfigured to accommodate the industrial production of maize. This region known as the Corn Belt comprises 150 million acres that are almost exclusively planted in a corn-soybean rotation. Depending on one\u2019s viewpoint, it can be a devastating sight. One of the world\u2019s most diverse plants reduced to a handful of varieties planted in monocultured row after row after row. Not much lives in these fields apart from the cultivated plant. Landscapes without insects, without nematodes, spiders, poppies, grasses, people.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"embed","title":"","embed":"<iframe title=\"Data Flow 1\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/428417704?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","caption":"The monocultured Corn Belt, as seen from above.

This sight could be read as \u201cfood security,\u201d and perhaps induce a sense of comfort. For the local farmers, it\u2019s equally existential. But it\u2019s not that they have a choice. The image of White smallholding farmers living and working the land in ecological harmony perpetuated by popular imagery and Big Agriculture belies the reality of an extractive and punishing industry that saps the life out of people and plants alike. Rising demand for food, fuel, and feed is forcing farmers to maximize productivity, which is increasingly tied to data: measuring and quantifying nutrients, seed viability, weather conditions, planting depth or disease history are meant to ensure the most precise and economic distribution of input, be it seeds, water, fertilizer or other chemicals. A flow of data guides a flow of matter that secures the flow of food.<\/p>\n<p>My interest in maize stems from my fascination with the plant geneticist Barbara McClintock, or more precisely, from reading Evelyn Fox Keller\u2019s biography of McClintock, <em>A Feeling for the Organism<\/em>.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Evelyn Fox Keller, <em>A Feeling for the Organism: The Life and Work of Barbara McClintock.<\/em> San Francisco: W.

I like to think that the colorful kernels of flint corn are the beginning of big data. They are nonbinary, carrying many shades of color. I hadn\u2019t quite realized just how many until Michael Swierz, poet, translator and \u201cparticipant ecologist,\u201d while clearing the back seat of his car to make room for journalist and author Fritz Habekuss, MPI research scholar Christoph Rosol, and me, handed me an enormous mason jar filled with flint corn kernels. It was beautiful\u2014small pebbles of magnolias, violets, yellows, whites, and blues. At first, I didn\u2019t really know what I was looking at.<\/p>\n<p>What would it mean to think about data through maize, to think about maize through data? For one, it\u2019d make data more tangible and material, add a temporal, developmental dimension to its analysis. Concurrently, diffracting maize through data can render visible how variant forms of maize, like patented hybrids, are structured through heterogenous networks involving copyright and patent laws, international development policies, population statistics, and logistical standards. In my work as a sociologist and sociocultural anthropologist, I\u2019m concerned with the datafication of nature and its social, political, and cultural ramifications. To me, the datafication of nature refers to a wide-ranging project that seeks to translate biotic and abiotic life into governable measures and values. It involves diverse practices, from digitizing natural-history specimens, to sequencing and barcoding environmental samples, to modeling vegetation types using remote sensing. Despite their obvious differences, all these practices represent attempts to abstract and reduce complex organisms and interactions into discrete data points. Yet, these processes are shot through with turbulences that don\u2019t reduce but displace complexity. In going on this journey to trace flows of data and maize along the Mississippi, I wanted to recover some of this complexity.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":26200,"id":26200,"title":"Nadim_Bild_1","filename":"Nadim_Bild_1.jpg","filesize":777080,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/nadim_bild_1\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Sketch by Tahani Nadim","caption":"Field diary, sketch showing the anatomy of maize and power, Lock & Dam 8, Vernon County, Wisconsin.","name":"nadim_bild_1","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-05-30 11:42:20","modified":"2020-06-03 16:25:33","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1553,"height":2479,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1-481x768.jpg","thumbnail-width":481,"thumbnail-height":768,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1-188x300.jpg","medium-width":188,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1-768x1226.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":1226,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1-877x1400.jpg","large-width":877,"large-height":1400,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1-962x1536.jpg","1536x1536-width":962,"1536x1536-height":1536,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1-1283x2048.jpg","2048x2048-width":1283,"2048x2048-height":2048,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Bild_1-752x1200.jpg","feature-width":752,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>With the help of McClintock, maize initiated a radical shift in Western science in thinking about the relation between bodies and their environments. According to Darwinian evolutionary theory, adaptions (evolution) of organisms occur over extremely long periods of time and no rapid mutations happen in \u201cnature.\u201d To be sure, this point has been a long-standing battleground in natural history as well as its successor sciences. The issue was settled when McClintock\u2019s work, which found the genome to be much more responsive than previously thought, became accepted. This motivated the development of epigenetics, which proved that environmental factors can lead to changes on the genetic level, thus returning scientific consensus to the previously discredited idea of inheritance of acquired traits. So, flint maize kernels changed the understanding of interaction between bodies and environments, making bodies coextensive with their environments.<\/p>\n<p>What I like about the story of McClintock seeing chromosomes that transform into jumping genes that fuel data-driven genomics is what it says about data. Data are the product of embodied labors, sometimes far away, but never entirely absent. In my work, I\u2019m concerned with recovering or figuring these labors that make data work, that make data global, and, possibly, that make data accountable. My colleague at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin, Christian B\u00f6lling, recently stressed the importance of \u201cmetadata provenance\u201d for ensuring responsible sharing and reuse of data as well as the longevity of the resource. Whereas metadata describe the properties of an object, such as its size, language, or title, provenance metadata relates to an object\u2019s creation and gestation: when it was made, modified, issued and who created it, contributed to it and retains the rights and ownership. This means that data models\u2014the structures that determine the entities that data describes and how they relate\u2014need to provide for data histories or, more precisely, genealogies. If we, for example, digitize a herbarium sheet containing (parts of) a pressed and dried maize plant, then we include relevant metadata concerning not just the physical object\u2014its scientific name, where and when it was collected, by whom\u2014but also concerning the entities and processes that contributed to its creation as a resource and digital object. But, naturally, there will always be data missing because they were lost or deemed not relevant or because the interface didn\u2019t allow for their capture. Data provenance makes evident the many steps and protagonists involved in making data. It also points to the decisions behind systems and infrastructures, decisions that often manifest as gaps and absences.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":26202,"id":26202,"title":"Nadim_Kew_Herbarium","filename":"Nadim_Kew_Herbarium.jpg","filesize":1784468,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/data-flow\/nadim_kew_herbarium\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"\u00a9 The Board of Trustees of the RBG, Kew <a href=\"http:\/\/specimens.kew.org\/herbarium\/K000632869.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/specimens.kew.org\/herbarium\/K000632869.<\/a>","caption":"Maize plant collected on the steep slope along the road to Jacaltenango in the Western Highlands of Guatemala in 1976 and now residing in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London.","name":"nadim_kew_herbarium","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":26320,"date":"2020-05-30 11:42:34","modified":"2020-07-02 15:35:38","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1270,"height":2000,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium-488x768.jpg","thumbnail-width":488,"thumbnail-height":768,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium-191x300.jpg","medium-width":191,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium-768x1209.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":1209,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium-889x1400.jpg","large-width":889,"large-height":1400,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium-975x1536.jpg","1536x1536-width":975,"1536x1536-height":1536,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium.jpg","2048x2048-width":1270,"2048x2048-height":2000,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Nadim_Kew_Herbarium-762x1200.jpg","feature-width":762,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>Corn and soy constitute our planet\u2019s most important grain crops, used for human food, animal feed, and ethanol production (biofuel).

We ate processed bread and processed cheese as part of a parking-lot picnic in front of a bleak supermarket in a desolate-looking part of Hannibal, Missouri. We learned later from Faye Dant, founder of the Jim\u2019s Journey: The Huck Finn Freedom Center, that this had been a thriving African American community that was destroyed in the course of the racist \u201curban renewal\u201d policies of the 1950s and \u201960s. Later that day back at our camp site, we ate a delicious hot pot cooked by our resident chefs and fellow River Travelers John Kim and Steven Diehl, made inside an enormous pumpkin procured by HKW\u2019s Neli Wagner from a petrol station somewhere near the Quad Cities. They stuffed the decorative Halloween pumpkin with mushrooms, pumpkin flesh, and cheese and placed it on a log fire, where we watched it blubber for hours. In Burlington, Illinois, we were treated to a collective feast by the members of the Aldo Leopold Foundation, who kindly and generously shared their delicious dishes with us. I ate mac and cheese for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>As Bertoni writes, \u201ceating does not occur alone,\u201d meaning that it always involves others, even if only distant and microscopic ones\u2014the gut bacteria that help digestion and all the human and nonhuman participants of the food chain that deliver produce. Nowhere was the flow of relations that eating enacts as present as at the dinner that was prepared and shared at the Black Hawk Museum and Lodge in Rock Island, Illinois. The women who cooked the food described how their dishes combined food traditions from the local First Nations and from Indigenous Peoples in Brazil who have been fighting to protect their lands and right to nourishment. Traces of maize have been found in the remains of ceramic vessels in Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and the Caribbean, some dating back to 8000 BCE.

Here, the provenance of foodstuff is secured through establishing traceability. This means issuing unique identifications to elements in the supply chain, from farm to storage location, suppliers, logistical units, and companies. I started thinking about traceability after fellow John Kim mentioned its impact on small-scale organic farming. We were driving through the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, which is home to many organic farms, including the biggest producer in the US, Organic Valley. Traceability becomes an existential issue once it is seen as a prerequisite for entering markets or, indeed, for being considered \u201corganic.\u201d One problem for small-scale operations is the time and effort spent on record-keeping and data management, which becomes all the more complex the greater the diversity of plants a farm grows. I imagine that tracing and tracking heirloom varieties and seeds that have been kept and circulated in communities across generations is quite an impossible task. Yet, like all life, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/lost-crops-conversation\">maize retains traces of its close and distant relatives<\/a> in its genome: of the wild grass (teosintes) in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua; of rice, from which it diverged 50 million years ago; and of sorghum, with which it parted ways only 9 million years ago.<\/p>\n<p>At the Genoa National Fish Hatchery in Wisconsin, we were able to bear witness to how traceability is being integrated into restoration efforts. Lake sturgeon populations in North America (some scientists estimate globally) have been declining due to overfishing and habitat destruction, and so the hatchery is producing sturgeon to restock the populations in lakes around the country.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\"> T.J.

They were no bigger than twelve centimeters but they looked their age: somewhere between 208 and 245 million years old. At the back of the building, a school class had gathered around an assembly line of volunteers who were tagging each fish using coded wire micro-tags. This is done so that, once released into the wild, hatchery-reared fish can be distinguished from wild populations (for the calculation of survival rates and population trends) and to distinguish between different lots of fish. At Genoa, they tag about 60,000 to 80,000 fingerlings per summer.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"embed","title":"","embed":"<iframe title=\"Data Flow 5\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/428416561?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","caption":"Lake sturgeon fingerlings at the Genoa National Fish Hatchery in Wisconsin.

KERNEL PANIC!<\/p>\n<p>The data that are imagined to reside in maize are vast indeed. With its turn to big data, Big Ag has set its sights on data as a new cash crop. The movement of crops, from farms to silos, barges, and processing plants to plates and troughs is nowadays accompanied by a thick data flow that is feeding more and more distributaries. Farm machinery is equipped with sensors that continuously send soil, land, and weather data and numbers on fertilizer use and water levels. These data can be aggregated to set crop prices or predict insurance claims or develop fertilizer. They can also be combined with data on land registration and credit use to drive the dispossession and privatization of common lands.
