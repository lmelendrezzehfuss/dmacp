We imagine that the river (or lake, or pond, as the case may be) has always been pretty much where it is now, in the configuration we presently see. This exploration examines one place, now known as the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary in St. Paul, Minnesota, and will contain provocations and assumptions that can\u2019t be demonstrated within the confines offered here, but which, nevertheless, might help make sense of the complexity of one particular location on the Mississippi River. The land and water at the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary offer a case study of how humans have lived on the land and with the water systems, have successively dominated these systems and ignored them, and have tried to \u201crestore\u201d those systems, each time following a pattern that seemed like the logical, normative \u201cright,\u201d or the \u201conly\u201d thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>I am not Dakota, but I have learned from Dakota people that all of the area where the \u201cTwin Cities\u201d now sit is Dakota homeland.

Over time in the first few decades of St. Paul\u2019s existence, the \u201cbottomless bog\u201d between downtown and Dayton\u2019s Bluff posed a substantial obstacle to transportation. A few streets crossed the creeks and bottomlands, beginning in the 1870s, using a variety of bridges, culverts, and trestles. Most notably, a 50-foot mound of soil, clay, and miscellaneous materials located in what is now Lowertown was cleared in the late 1870s and hauled east, to fill the \u201cslough of despond\u201d and create space for the rail infrastructure and the city\u2019s first Union Depot.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">See Greg Brick, <em>Historic Waters of the Capitol Region Watershed District, Ramsey County, MN<\/em>.

Yet, the advent of the railroads brought the most dramatic physical change to this space over time. During the second half of the nineteenth century, St. Paul assumed a position as the uppermost port on the Mississippi River and a major transshipment point between riverboat and rails that took goods and people out across the northern plains. What had been a \u201cbottomless slough\u201d had become one of the country\u2019s busiest railyards.<\/p>\n<p>It is no mean feat to achieve this sort of land- and waterscape transformation. Writing in the early twentieth century, Josiah Chaney described projects that had filled in sections of the Mississippi River bank between the downtown bluff and Phalen Creek. He lists two projects that created approximately 16 acres of new land, filling out between 100 and 190 feet from the previous shore for a distance of some 4,300 feet (over three-quarters of a mile).<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Chaney, Ibid.<\/span><\/span><\/span> Historian Paul Hesterman also notes that Dayton\u2019s Bluff was cut back extensively during this period, to make more room for the railroad, but nearly destroying \u201cCarver\u2019s Cave.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Hesterman, Ibid.<\/span><\/span><\/span> Later, during an era of extensive highway construction, the building of Warner Road across this space, which entailed building a raised prism of land to elevate the roadway above ordinary high water levels, further cut the land off from the Mississippi River channel.<\/p>\n<p>Students of the class Dimensions of Urban Change will be surprised to learn that an affluent neighborhood, including houses for some of the railroad executives themselves, were demolished in the effort to create more land for the railroad.

During this time, the city and the region\u2019s attention turned to highways and air transportation. The \u201cSwede Hollow\u201d community, which is located immediately upstream (north) along Phalen Creek, was wiped out by the City of St. Paul in 1956, after being described as a health hazard. And although numerous published accounts tell nostalgically of life in \u201cSwede Hollow,\u201d the reports of privies suspended over the creek and an absence of running water or electricity in the community give some credence to this claim. So now, instead of being the city\u2019s \u201cfront door,\u201d the Mississippi River corridor had become the \u201cmud room,\u201d a space where dirty, wet things are discarded out of sight of the more polite parts of the city (or house, to continue the metaphor).<\/p>\n<p>Beginning in the 1990s, residents of adjacent neighborhoods started to be concerned that the former railroad site and the hollow where people had lived until recently were detrimental to neighborhood development and well-being. Neighborhood organizations such as Friends of Swede Hollow and the Lower Phalen Creek Project began a series of transformative efforts that have restored the landscape. The area\u2019s new name\u2014Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary\u2014is after a local US congressman who was instrumental in establishing the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (Mississippi NRRA), a unit of the National Park Service (NPS) that follows the river through the Twin Cities. Years of focused effort has replaced the trash-strewn site with ecologically sustainable prairie and oak-savannah planting. A coalition of neighborhood groups, environmental advocacy organizations, and commitments from local, state, and federal government came about to achieve the transformation of a 27-acre brownfield into a valuable, if still hidden, gem, within roughly a decade of intensive activity. Since 2005, after extended community-engagement processes that have centered on the perspectives of Dakota people, an abandoned warehouse building has been demolished, to be replaced, project leaders hope, with a \u201cWakan Tipi Center\u201d that would be a community resource for all.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":17300,"id":17300,"title":"One place many names 1","filename":"fig4_300dpi.jpg","filesize":4373819,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/one-place-many-names\/fig4_300dpi\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Photo by the author.","caption":"Figure 3: Entrance to the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary, July 2019.","name":"fig4_300dpi","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":17281,"date":"2020-01-22 11:18:03","modified":"2020-02-11 14:23:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":3024,"height":4032,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi-576x768.jpg","thumbnail-width":576,"thumbnail-height":768,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi-225x300.jpg","medium-width":225,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi-768x1024.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":1024,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi-1050x1400.jpg","large-width":1050,"large-height":1400,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi.jpg","1536x1536-width":1152,"1536x1536-height":1536,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi.jpg","2048x2048-width":1536,"2048x2048-height":2048,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig4_300dpi-900x1200.jpg","feature-width":900,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":17323,"id":17323,"title":"One Place Many Names","filename":"fig3_300dpi.jpg","filesize":1215206,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/one-place-many-names\/fig3_300dpi\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Photo by the author.","caption":"Figure 4: Interpretive marker, Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary, July 2019.\n\n","name":"fig3_300dpi","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":17281,"date":"2020-01-22 12:52:43","modified":"2020-02-11 14:22:38","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1073,"height":1431,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi-576x768.jpg","thumbnail-width":576,"thumbnail-height":768,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi-225x300.jpg","medium-width":225,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi-768x1024.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":1024,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi-1050x1400.jpg","large-width":1050,"large-height":1400,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi.jpg","1536x1536-width":1073,"1536x1536-height":1431,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi.jpg","2048x2048-width":1073,"2048x2048-height":1431,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/fig3_300dpi-900x1200.jpg","feature-width":900,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>The case of the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary raises three immediate questions: The site has \u201cdeindustrialized,\u201d but to what end? To serve whose needs? At whose behest? Two decades ago, when I first got involved with Mississippi River work, it seemed to be enough to bring people to the river by providing open space and allowing city governments to drive development\/redevelopment projects in the vicinity. These projects, we thought, would bring a constituency to the river. While it is true that they have, it is also true to say that they have remade the river as a \u201cgreen gentrification\u201d zone, attractive to the elite and generating specialty coffee shops, high-end restaurants, and other businesses that are hallmarks of gentrification elsewhere. Thus far, the Vento Sanctuary has resisted this fate, but it\u2019s an open question as to for how long. Thus far, there is minimal signage or other \u201cintrusions\u201d upon the landscape, with only a series of interpretive markers required by the state Department of Natural Resources as a condition for its participation in the land-acquisition project in the early 2000s. But the heavily \u201cbranded,\u201d bustling \u201cLowertown District\u201d and CHS Field, home of the St. Paul\u2019s Saints baseball team, are only a couple of blocks away. As more urban elites come into the area, how much will the essential qualities of the Vento Sanctuary remain? Can \u201crestoration\u201d or \u201cdeindustrialization\u201d escape \u201ccapital,\u201d or is this space, in its latest manifestation, destined to attract the wealthy\u2014albeit demonstrated differently than 100 years ago?<\/p>\n<p>If we are unable to return to &#8220;nature&#8221; then what do we call this hybrid human-biological-physical system? The Anthropocene, the term for the &#8220;age defined by humans,&#8221; may provide us with language that focuses our attention to the significant features of this place. &#8220;Anthropocene&#8221; points to the roles of the between spaces like this, as spaces distinctive in and of themselves as well as embedded in larger human and nonhuman systems. Places like the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary are connectors to infrastructure systems, are unqiue points along systems such as the Mississippi migratory bird flyway, and have a particular located history expressed through the stories of wakan tipi. We can see the Vento site as important in its own right, as a place where human meaning and efforts have been layered for thousands of years, and also as a central connector, reaching both upstream and down to more readily visible places such as St. Anthony Falls, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, and Lake Pepin. What we must have is the language that enables us to see through the palimpsest, to describe the layers of the landscape&#8217;s history, and to understand the dynamics of how people made places, understood, and inhabited them over centuries.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":17199,"post_author":"12","post_date":"2020-01-17 17:40:43","post_date_gmt":"2020-01-17 16:40:43","post_content":"","post_title":"Patrick Nunnally","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"17199","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-03 18:23:33","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-03 17:23:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=17199","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/17199\/","acf":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Nunnally"}}],"projects":[{"ID":17150,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2020-02-10 14:58:12","post_date_gmt":"2020-02-10 13:58:12","post_content":"<p>An essay collection exploring the past and future infrastructural interventions into the Mississippi River.<\/p>\n  <p>Taking as a starting point its concerns with the past infrastructural interventions into the Mississippi River as well those developments still to come, three of Field Station 1\u2019s primary organizers, <a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/morgan-adamson\">Morgan Adamson<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/bruce-braun\">Bruce Braun<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/roopali-phadke\">Roopali Phadke<\/a>, have commissioned a collection of essays to explore these conditions further.
