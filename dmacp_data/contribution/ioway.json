So if you put up a structure like a water tower, I have to do the research and the studies to make sure it\u2019s not going to disturb ancestral burials or ancestral sites. And I do that work for all nine states, roughly, that we\u2019ve been in before our removal to this place, since the beginning: Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri. All those states, or portions thereof, have sites that are associated with our people, but we also have other sites as far as Manitoba. My tribe doesn\u2019t have a cultural division, and it doesn\u2019t fund one, so all the culture-related things, whether it\u2019s language or NAGPRA, comes down to me to do or not do. That\u2019s why my schedule is pretty tight sometimes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does this work differ from the reclamation work or memory work you do in your artmaking?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, I\u2019ve always done this kind of work. When I went back to Montana, I recovered probably close to a dozen boxes of material on the Ioway and our landscape, our language and culture, and my art, material gathered since my teens, and I\u2019m almost 60 now. The biggest part of my life has been about trying to gather this information from different sources and work with it creatively, and portray it.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>According to tribal tradition, the ancestors of the Ioway Indians united as a people ages ago. The Clans had come together and agreed to become a People, the Honga, the Great Nation. Some clans had come from the Great Lakes. Others had come from the north, from a land remembered as very cold. Others had come from the western prairies or the eastern woodlands. Some of the ancestors had made great mounds in the shapes of animals and birds along the bluffs of the Great River. Others had traded down the River to the great southern mound cities, and came back with new ceremonies, new beliefs to add to the older ones.<\/p>\n<p>This development of the Clans into one Nation is traced in the ancient stories and traditions of the Ioway and their brothers, the Otoe, the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), and Missouria. Other relatives of these peoples also seem to have been a part of this Nation, including the Omaha, Ponca, Kansa, Quapaw, and Osage. These stories recall a time when they were all one people. A time when all the land of this Middle Place was theirs.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u2013\u2013Lance M.

There\u2019s an account, I think it was Mahaska or White Cloud\u2019s account, about when we crossed over Lake Pepin, before that there\u2019s only a dim memory of what happened. In our oral tradition we have a pretty good record from the 1800s onwards, before that time there\u2019s bits and pieces, and I\u2019d say right around the 1600s it almost goes right into mythological time. It\u2019s hard; you\u2019ve got time working against you, you\u2019ve got the fact that we\u2019ve suffered catastrophic population loss, with all the loss of memory that goes along with that, and also I would say there\u2019s another factor in that in our warrior tradition, you remember when you win battles, more than when you lose them. For example the story of how the Ioway left southern Minnesota is recorded more in Dakota sources. That\u2019s why I often go to the Dakotas or the Ho-Chunk to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s your memory, what are your traditions on that?\u201d It\u2019s interesting stuff.<\/p>\n<p>For example, for Pipestone, all we know is that people weren\u2019t supposed to fight there, that it was part of our area, and then we got pressed south after the 1700\u2019s, when the Yankton were expanding, and they became the guardians of the pipestone after us. But we and the Otoe remember that we were up there and that we were the big traders of pipestone for hundreds of years.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s the Apache saying, \u201cwisdom sits in places,\u201d where you talk about place as memory. Well, when you take a group of people and remove them from where their memory house was\u2026 their places remind them of these stories, and our stories now since 1836 are mostly here. And I\u2019m shocked at how even many of those stories have faded, with changes in culture.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":28811,"id":28811,"title":"03KS_05leary_site01","filename":"03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","filesize":3708275,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/03ks_05leary_site01\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Image courtesy the authors ","caption":"Marker at the Leary Site\/Nimaha Cina Rexige, Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska","name":"03ks_05leary_site01","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-09-29 15:41:02","modified":"2020-09-29 15:41:26","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":8196,"height":5464,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":32,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_05leary_site01.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><strong>Can you tell us more about the Leary Site? And can you also talk more generally about what constitutes a sacred landscape?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Leary site is near the mouth of the Nemaha River. It was occupied from about 1200 to 1400, and even in the 1850s and 1860s, but above it are some mounds from the Hopewell, about 3,000 years ago. It was part of a sacred landscape. The bluff by the Nemaha was likely an animal lodge where the animal spirits lived. If you go up to Indian Caves State Park, there is a cave that was probably where the Buffalo spirits lived along the river. The Pawnee are the ones who have the fullest developed memory of that in this area, they call them rahurahwa:ruksti: \u2018u, [\u201c(being) holy ground.\u201d], it is the animal councils who would gather. So the Leary Site was a place where the ancestral Ioway and Otoe along with the ancestral Arikara and Skiri Pawnee lived and traded with each other for probably 200 to 300 years. It was a really important site. If you think of Cahokia as New York and you think Blood Run would be say Chicago, this is like Kansas City. There were probably 3,000 people who lived there at the height. We have done some remote sensing there with LiDAR and found both square earth lodges and burials all over the place.<\/p>\n<p>They traded pipestone and buffalo hides; we\u2019re going to have a little exhibit here about it. It\u2019s just an amazing place. Alan Kelley, Tribal Vice Chairman and first THPO said he had a medicine man come to the Leary Site and he said the ancient ones came around him and asked who he was and what he was doing there, and he explained things to them. Even as late as a couple of years ago, we had one of our tribal folks go up there in the winter time and they smelled of cooking food, you know? So it is a living place, for sure.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It is said that at one time, the Ioway had such power that a person of another tribe could not make a footprint anywhere in our territory without the Ioway knowing about it immediately, and that none could be here without our permission.<\/p>\n<p>This was not because the Ioway were a particularly large tribe, but because we had been, according to our traditions, the first keepers of the Pipestone Quarries in southwest Minnesota, and because we had established a sacred covenant with the many natural forces and spirits who were the First Beings of the Land Between Two Rivers. These forces and spirits were our relatives, and would let us know about anything that was going on in our lands as soon as it happened. \u2026In 1837, Grandfather No Heart defended our ancestral rights to these lands by producing a hand-drawn map showing our many villages and routes of travel.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u2013\u2013Lance M.

Can you talk more about the kinship between Ioway and Ho-Chunk?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve talked to Ioways in Oklahoma whose family members married into the Ho-Chunk Winnebago in Wisconsin. So there\u2019s been intermarriages sporadically that continue that kind of tie. I know that the Otoe Missouria have taken a bus load of their seniors to visit the Ho-Chunk up there. There have been a lot of parallel efforts like this.<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, in my work as THPO with Bill Quackenbush from Ho-Chunk and Randy Teboe of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska and others, we\u2019re coming at this from a lot of different directions. There\u2019s not a unified or single program. It may come to that, though, because we\u2019re also trying to reaffirm our ancient trading networks in relationships. So it\u2019s, again, a developing thing. It took hundreds of years to be fissioned apart. It\u2019s going to take a while to get it back, but it\u2019s there. And it\u2019s always amazing to me when I hear somebody else\u2019s independent stories about how they\u2019re doing things too.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A few days ago, I returned from a celebration held at Effigy Mounds National Monument in northeast Iowa. At the speakers\u2019 table, members of the Ioway, Otoe-Missouria, and Ho-Chunk once more gathered as one people, something that had not happened at this locality for at least 170 years. It was in 1830 that our ancestors gathered across the Nyitanga at Prairie du Chien, to sign one of the treaties that would be used to remove us from these lands where our grandfathers and grandmothers sleep in the graves in the bluffs high above, where the mounds shaped like our Bear and Thunder ancestors cluster and march.<\/p>\n<p>We talk about this. We will see. The S\u2019ageh, the Old People, our grandmothers and grandfathers sleeping out there on the bluffs, made that covenant. Even now, perhaps they are guiding their wayward grandchildren to fulfill it once more.<\/p>\n<p>Our oldest traditions indicate that many of our clans, such as the Bear, split off from our relatives the Hochungara (Ho-Chunk or Winnebago), whom we also called our fathers or grandfathers, and whom we left behind near Makashuje, Red Banks, on the shores of Lake Michigan in Wisconsin. We left with our sister tribes the Otoe and Missouria, who continued on to search for new lands.<\/p>\n<p>This fissioning process appears to have begun very early, perhaps as early as A.D. 700, but was finalized by the 1500s. No one is sure. However, the Ioway continued to visit their relatives the Winnebago, or Ho-Chunk, into historic times.

She is Emil Campbell\u2019s great granddaughter, and she was going to art school in Lawrence, and she did the signs as a project. She created bumper stickers and signs, and if you drive along the river, there are certain hollows and creeks that have the Ioway names.<\/p>\n<p>We saw some connections between the work that she is doing with those signs in asserting Ioway relationships to the land and what you\u2019re doing in your own artwork, and as the THPO for the nation.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a group effort, and we all use our individual knowledge or talents.

During allotment, when the land was divided up, we lost most of our land, by the 1940\u2019s non-Natives owned 90% of the reservation. We bought some of it back. But a lot of tribal members, like my grandparents, had to move away for jobs during World War II. We were divided during the Civil War, the greater number of adult men fought on the side of the North in the Civil War and when they came back the tribe kind of split. Some were tied to their places here, the burial sites, and they wanted to stay, and a lot of the other ones wanted to live more like Indian people did, to have a village and all that, so they moved down to Oklahoma in the 1870s, but by the 1880s they were allotted as well. So we have two groups of Ioway: the northern ones, we are a lot more mixed here, but the part that we have is probably more Ioway. Down south they mix more with the Otoes and the Creeks. So they look more Indian but the language is a little more blended with Otoe. In the tribe there are all these social systems and circles and relationships, and people know who the family gets along with and who they don\u2019t, and all of these generations of memory\u2026It\u2019s entangled.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":28821,"id":28821,"title":"04IA_03quackenbush01","filename":"04IA_03quackenbush01-scaled.jpg","filesize":1038683,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/04ia_03quackenbush01\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Image courtesy the authors","caption":"Bill Quackenbush, Historic Preservation Officer for the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, came to Kansas to help build the Ioway Lodge.","name":"04ia_03quackenbush01","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-09-29 15:52:39","modified":"2020-09-29 15:53:43","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1707,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-1536x1024.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-2048x1365.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/04IA_03quackenbush01-1600x1067.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><strong>How does that play out across or between tribes, because you are right next to the Sac and Fox, and also the Kickapoo? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are some families that go to the Kickapoo School and have relationships there.

Minnie Evans out of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation led that fight to maintain the tribes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Before, you mentioned perceptions of historical time, and settler society does a lot of work to inscribe its history in the landscape, and to remove the ways that places tell other stories. Up in Wisconsin, in the Kickapoo River Valley, Bill Quackenbush from Ho-Chunk took us and our children around and introduced us to place as story. The stories sounded like they were mythological time, but because they were connected to particular places, were very non-mythologizing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Very vivid right? Very vivid and historical.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And material, and political, and there\u2019s lessons that are pertinent to the present and to the future, right?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Right. Did you see our lodge outside? Bill Quackenbush helped build it. I\u2019m working on another project with Eric Zingler who is putting together traditions and thinking about the Ocooch Mountains which, you know, is kind of that same region in Wisconsin, and the Kickapoo River Valley has a lot of sites with rock art, some of which are associated with the Oneota culture that we, the Otoe, the Missouria and Ho-Chunk, all branched off of. Those are sacred places to us.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We called ourselves Baxoje, Paxoje, Paxoce, etc. Pronounced Bakoche\u2026The Winnebago variant of the name is Wakoche, although they tend to drop the final \u201ce\u201d in normal speech, so they can often say it as Wakoch. The P and W sounds are often said very softly. These names would have been heard by non-Indians and written either as Ocoche or Ocooch.<\/p>\n<p>The Oneota\u2026were all over that [Driftless] area, and our earliest sites are as far north as Lake Pepin and Red Wing, over to Effigy Mounds and the Upper Iowa, and La Crosse has all kinds of our sites. We (Ioway, Otoe, Winnebago) lived in this area for centuries before the Sauk and Meskwaki or Kickapoo came there (in the late 1600s or the 1700s, as they left the lands scarred by Iroquois warfare during the Beaver Wars)\u2026The Ocooch area would have been a place for hunting and fishing, but also rituals like vision questing, which is reflected in the rock art (petroglyphs and pictographs) in some of the rock shelters there that show Oneota art. That\u2019s the pattern from about AD 900 to 1670 or so, when the Ioway (wakoch\/ocoche) left the area for good, probably due to disease, resource depletion, and increasing war.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u2013\u2013Lance M.

And just thinking about the origins of that word and what that means about relationships to that place in the past and present, I\u2019d love to hear you reflect a little bit more on Ocooch.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s interesting because there\u2019s a couple of things going on there. the opening vowel might be a derivation of ho. In Ioway and Ho-Chunk there is a distinguishing between vowels if you nasalize or don\u2019t nasalize them\u2013\u2013ho<sup>n<\/sup> vs ho. Ho I think means fish and ho<sup>n<\/sup> means voice. So Ho<sup>n<\/sup>-chungra, that\u2019s nasal, it means the big voice. Kuje means to shoot something, so ho-kuje means to shoot a fish with a bow and arrow. Ho-Chunk close their words with a consonant, so m\u00fa<sup>n<\/sup>c is their word for bear, we say m\u00fa<sup>n<\/sup>je. So Ho-kuc, vs Ho-kuje [Ocooch vs Ocoochay].<\/p>\n<p>And then I came across, in a lexical list, that Ocooch was one of the terms for the Wisconsin River and some of the smaller rivers off it. They were traditionally places where our ancestors would spear for fish out of canoes. And then Eric showed me a source that said that this word, Ocooch, was after a people who lived there at one time.<\/p>\n<p>So we explored how that would relate to Baxoje. Ci means a house and ba of course, is snowy. And so our word for baxoje means a lot of different things. Like xoje means ashy, it means gray. And then ba either can mean, if you say it ba with a solid B, it means snow. But if you say it with an unaspirated P, pa\u2014unaspirated means there\u2019s no puff of air\u2014it means nose or head. To an English ear it sounds like the same word. So, baxoje or paxoje either it could mean gray snow, ashy snow, gray nose. And then there\u2019s the chee part, like cakirutha, which means the part of the lodge, so \u201csnow on the lodges.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So the question is which does it mean? And I think it\u2019s sort of like the name for ourselves. We don\u2019t know for sure because it was so long ago, and everybody has their apocryphal story that they favor\u2026and we\u2019re all part of the story, there\u2019s not only one right answer, all of these are part of what makes a place name. So if one takes for a certainty that it relates to a people who where there, well, we know the Ho-Chunk were further to the east at that time, and the Ioway were west on that side. And that\u2019s why I was very interested in the Kickapoo Valley name, because the Kickapoo came in after all of us. So that\u2019s really interesting to me on that level.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s really hard for people to understand. Like when they want to change back Loess Bluffs to Squaw Creek, and white people don\u2019t seem to understand that squaw is a derogatory term, it\u2019s a term that dehumanizes. So, an Indian baby isn\u2019t a baby, it\u2019s a papoose. An Indian woman isn\u2019t a woman, she\u2019s a squaw. An Indian man isn\u2019t a man, he\u2019s a buck. So we\u2019ve got people who mythologize Indians into this kind of never, never land of papooses and squaws and bucks without seeing them as human beings. They either make them into savage devils who they had to wipe out to make room for the white people, or after that chapter is done, then they kind of mythologize them into Hiawatha and the land of Gitche Gumee and sailing on the waters\u2026They never see us as people.<\/p>\n<p>So the problem with place names is that people make up \u201cIndian\u201d names for places, and so Ocooch, the Snowy Mountains. What we were trying to do is find how could you come up with this weird settler interpretation of Snowy Mountains with a native term which really means fish spearing waters, a place where you spear fish? And so, we did a bunch of excavation with some of our names for ourselves and some alternatives. The difficulty with talking to non-Indians about this, or even to look at something and discuss things as possibilities, is that, next thing you know, it becomes like that\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s the difficulty we face. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever get out of that because people still see Indians as something separate in the sense of either not quite human or more than human.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, and this seems like a very different conversation between Indians and non-Indians than what you were alluding to earlier with the conversations that you are having with the Ho-Chunk over understandings of relationships to place, which are overlapping and complex. So the conversations you mentioned with Bill and other folks at Ho-Chunk about how they understand Ocooch feels like a very different kind of conversation and conversational space than what you\u2019re describing right now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is, and it\u2019s something that we hammer out with each other, because you got to remember our cultures were like a multi-thousand piece jigsaw puzzle that somebody came by and knocked off the table. And now we\u2019re scrambling for pieces, and I have this piece and you have that piece, and we\u2019re trying to see how they fit together while somebody is saying, \u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t fit right. No, you got to do this. No, you got to find the edge piece.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cWait a minute, we\u2019re working with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>We\u2019re also thinking about climate disruption and how relationships to place are shifting as places themselves are changing and moving. How do you account for these movements?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are sitting in a space heated by propane, we are using the devices with rare earth minerals. If we wanted to go live in that lodge out there, that canvas is made from something. If we wanted to live the old ways there\u2019s no way you can, because you don\u2019t own the land, there\u2019s not enough deer to support everybody. So we are trapped. People call us hypocrites, because we are trying to address that. But on the other side, which is wind farms, all these alternatives, you\u2019ve got the money machine under that. We have painted ourselves into a corner.<\/p>\n<p>You know what a glissade is, when you are mountain climbing and it\u2019s icy, and you do a controlled fall with your ice ax? What we need is an eco-glissade, a controlled fall so that things don\u2019t totally get destroyed. A controlled descent, a controlled contraction. And nobody is talking about that. They are talking about alternate modes of growth. Or sustainability, which is ridiculous because this isn\u2019t sustainable.<\/p>\n<p>How American Indians always lived here is population control and learning from our mistakes. The Cheyenne only had one kid traditionally every four years or so. It was imposed that way, the mother breast fed the kids until a certain point, so you kept your population down that way. When you had overkill sometimes a mammoth disappeared. You learned you can\u2019t do that anymore, you let the mothers live, all that stuff. Well, this society does not have the long view.<\/p>\n<p>We had a shot in the 1970s with the NEPA and the Clean Air Act, we had a section of the population that tried to do something, but they got swamped. Then people forgot what it looked like when the rivers burn and you can see the air you breathe.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":28915,"id":28915,"title":"03KS_ioway_museum01","filename":"03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","filesize":4929291,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/ioway\/03ks_ioway_museum01\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Image courtesy the authors","caption":"Baxoje Iowa Tribal Museum and Culture Center, White Cloud, Kansas.","name":"03ks_ioway_museum01","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":28798,"date":"2020-09-30 12:29:54","modified":"2020-09-30 12:30:15","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":8688,"height":5792,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":32,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/03KS_ioway_museum01.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>People have a relationship to the land of there is me and it.

And what happens as the trees fall in, there\u2019s no trees, they bulldoze that and put a pipe through it, so you get it rid of creeks that way too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There is an extraordinary amount of pressure on the waters, and it\u2019s not one single thing, it is incremental&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And cumulative.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do we visualize or describe this, when these points of extraction and contamination are so dispersed, and each one individually does not seem like much?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think if you can help people understand, just like Bill Quackenbush did, take the kids out there, if you can stoke people\u2019s curiosity: why is it like this, why is it not like that, what happened, what kind of plant is that, is that a plant on a poison-edible spectrum? Because if you use too much of a medicine it becomes poison, a little bit of poison becomes medicine. So how do you encourage complexity and curiosity in people\u2019s thinking?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The elements of this land were the great Powers, the Day, the Night, the Winds, the Winter. Although the Big Male Winter, the time of glaciers, had been killed by Mischinye, the Great Hare, long ago, the land still bore the scars of that glacial age, and the Small Female Winter still returned every year with her bitter winds. The great rivers were connected by overland trails through the upland prairie. In marshy country, the glacial eskers and ridges provided relatively dry travel for people and buffalo.<\/p>\n<p>One such trail that is recorded in historic French maps was the one which led from the Ioway village on the Mississippi, across the marshy glacial plain of north-ern Iowa, to their villages on Okoboji and Spirit Lakes, and thence through the loess hills to their village on the Missouri River (Mott Wedel 1986). Although a detailed study has not been made of this route, I strongly suspect they used glacial landforms such as eskers on at leastparts of the trail where they provided drier passage across marshy terrain, as well as following the roads made by the buffalo herds.<sup>10<\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u2013\u2013Lance M.

And this was a time when there were monsters on the earth. They were close to wiping out mankind. And we had a series of heroes that came to earth that fought them so mankind could survive without being threatened. Some of these monsters were like giants, for example, that ate human beings. Some were weird ancient animals that also ate human beings or killed them. And some of this seems to have happened during a time of great cold, during a glacial period. Different tribes have different stories. And that\u2019s part of the other recovery of our culture is to find these stories again and began telling them, not just in a book, but to have active storytelling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These stories and this sort of knowledge seems very relevant. We talked about this a lot in March, this kind of long-term knowledge and memory of changing climates, I don\u2019t know if you think about it differently or value it differently given the climate disruption that we are experiencing today?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I do, and, in fact, I\u2019m kind of engaging with some folks from New Zealand and Australia around that. You have Traditional Ecological Knowledge which was passed down in oral history and traditions in all of our communities. And we each have different aspects to it and each live in different places. But then we have parts of Western society, like conservation science, which is trying different avenues of preservation. Like Rewilding North America, which is the idea to bring back connections between wild places so that nature becomes nature through its own processes again. We don\u2019t try to impose our ways on nature, but recover itself.<\/p>\n<p>So this Re-Wilding Iowa project I\u2019m doing at Effigy Mounds with five other Ioway artists is referring to aspects of Western conservation about corridors, carnivores and cores, refuges, different places that you connect through river corridors. And then you bring that together with Traditional Ecological Knowledge about what animals and plants should be there, how they interact with each other throughout the year. That\u2019s one major direction I\u2019m going in currently.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m also on a joint Indigenous Climate Task Force to try to see what we can bring to the table, because it\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to stop it by putting in windmills and stuff at this time. I think people are going to change their behavior, but how can we survive? Just like in the ancient times of glaciers, only it\u2019s going the other way now. What can we learn from our traditions about how to survive the changes that are coming?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your idea of eco-glissade, which we talked a lot about in March, was really fascinating. Then what you\u2019re describing too, these green river corridors in relation to rewilding seems like it\u2019s an understanding of the sort of land and territory that No Heart communicated in the map. That\u2019s significant there. As you were talking about the importance of telling these stories, I was curious about the significance of telling them in place, if that is something that you see as important, as a way of renewing relationships or establishing new relationships with places.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think that\u2019s very important. I think that\u2019s a common thread that most cultures around the world have, that speaking is part of our creative power as human beings. It\u2019s the breath of life that we have that is shaped by our mouths and our intentions and our thinking into stories. And if you tell those stories in the places you\u2019re trying to help heal, it is like a creation myth that you\u2019re making right there in that place, and maybe correcting it and bringing it back to a form of life that it needs to have. And I think that\u2019s how we can help people reconnect with places, is to tell stories of those places that are compatible with what the place needs to become.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3295,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:34","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:34","post_content":"","post_title":"Rozalinda Borcil\u0103","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"rozalinda-borcil","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-09-12 17:38:39","post_modified_gmt":"2019-09-12 15:38:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/rozalinda-borcil\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/rozalinda-borcil\/","acf":{"first_name":"Rozalinda","last_name":"Borcil\u0103"}},{"ID":3249,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:28","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:28","post_content":"","post_title":"Nicholas Brown","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"nicholas-brown","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-11-04 15:50:40","post_modified_gmt":"2019-11-04 14:50:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/nicholas-brown\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/nicholas-brown\/","acf":{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Brown"}}],"projects":[{"ID":590,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-09 10:26:37","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-09 08:26:37","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five introductions to responsibility for the uninvited traveller.<\/span><\/p>\n  <p>This series aims to provide readers with the contextual information necessary to become responsible uninvited guests in the <em>Anthropocene Drift<\/em>, while being nonprescriptive about the nature of that response.
