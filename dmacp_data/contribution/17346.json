I felt the thrill of being carried away\u2014cool mud between my toes, crawling back up the same way as my mother\u2014except I had chosen this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\/\/<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Palisade, the town where we grew up, was only home to 113 people by the time I knew it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It\u2019s not far from the headwaters in northern Minnesota, and about 1,000 miles from the river\u2019s mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The name Palisade refers to an embankment and, for some people, this conjures the vistas of Palisade Head on the north shore of Lake Superior, a place people go to view the expanse of that inland sea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">If you look up the town of Palisade on Instagram, you\u2019ll find countless photos mistakenly geotagged, smiling people at the edge of a cliff, the horizon fading behind them. <\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Palisade where I grew up had no vistas. It was a riverine swamp, with a small rise in the land imperceptible to most people, where a railroad could make a water crossing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\/\/<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The origin of the town of Palisade is a railroad bridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It\u2019s a place that was built so the Soo Line could cross the Mississippi. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">This crossing made it possible to move things that were being extracted from surrounding land (timber, iron ore) not only north to south by water, but east and west by rail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Those industries of extraction are also what made it possible for my family to settle there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Today, Palisade is also where the Canadian oil company Enbridge is seeking permits to cross beneath the river, so they can move oil from the Alberta tar sands to a refinry on the shores of Lake Superior. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\/\/<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I was born in 1982, the year before the railroad stopped running through town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">By the time I arrived, the population had declined significantly. Most of the buildings my mother and grandmother had known were vacant or torn down. <\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the 1980s, Aitkin County was the poorest county in the state of Minnesota. Many families here did not have indoor plumbing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\/\/ <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">My mom and her family were among a handful of settlers who stayed in Palisade after the busts of the timber industry and the mines on the Cuyuna Range. After the county stopped clearing ditches. After the farms flooded back to swamp. After the railroad stopped running and no one used the river to move things anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Growing up here, I always had the sense I was living \u201cafter\u201d a place had stopped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I knew from the stories we were told that for a time this was a real town. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I had no sense of what came before that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>I knew native people, had cousins who were \u201cChippewa\u201d\u2019 from nearby reservations\u2014but never understood that this was Anishinaabe or Ojibwe land we were occupying.<\/p>\n<p>The place I knew as a \u201cpalisade\u201d for the Soo Line Railroad was written on birchbark scrolls as the confluence of two rivers, what we call the Mississippi and the Willow.<\/p>\n<p>According to Ojibwe tribal attorney Frank Bibeau,<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Frank Bibeau, Presentation at the Kickoff of the <em>Mississippi.

Sick people, and those working elsewhere in the forest or the mines, had to be moved in and out the same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">For months, the families that lived here were living in the movement of water, river people after all.<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\/\/<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">There is also a story from that same era, when the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in Palisade. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Thousands of people came from across Northeastern Minnesota to hear a man from Duluth equate white supremacy\u2014over black people, Jewish people, and darker-skinned Eastern Europeans\u2014with patriotism and economic security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The article mentions how many cars lined the river road. It says nothing about the Indigenous peoples who\u2019d been displaced here, and yet were still living; or the fact that at the time, my grandfather, and others like him, who had recently migrated here to work in the mines, were not considered \u201cwhite\u201d either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They were in the process of becoming white. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\/\/<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">There are no stories in this Museum about the Ojibwe people who have and still reside on this river, or about what the riparian landscape was like before there was a town here. Before the railroad. Before us.<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\/\/<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the 1990s, when the rights of Ojibwe people to hunt, fish, and gather here were being reaffirmed in court, white hunters and fishermen put up signs on their land warning that they would shoot \u201cIndians\u201d if they trespassed, calling them \u201cspear-chuckers\u201d and much worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I remember hearing these slurs around my grandparents\u2019 dinner table. I imagined my uncles with guns chasing \u201cIndians\u201d through the woods, or bringing a human body home the way they brought home the animals they\u2019d killed, which hung from trees to bleed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\/\/<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Today, these memories, and the way they seemed so normal at that time, are horrifying to me, yet it seems wrong to pretend they were not part of our universe\u2014the way we made sense of this river and this place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Our river, the world as we knew it, was only possible because of the ones we displaced, denied, or erased\u2014violently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">That we displace, deny, and erase still\u2014violently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">On that point, most of the white people I grew up with still maintain that we could not have learned racism living in this small town all of those years, because <span class=\"None\"><i>everyone was white<\/i><\/span>.<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span

nowhere in the Museum of our river town. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Her story survives, as most do, in the space between people who whisper to one another:<\/span><\/p>\n<p

eventually learned how to swim.<\/p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t thrown into water, but was given an inner tube from an old tractor, and pushed gently from the sloping side of a gravel pit into the middle of a deep quarry lake.<\/p>\n<p>My mom thought it was safer to swim here, because the water didn\u2019t move.<\/p>\n<p>You couldn\u2019t see the bottom, but at least it was still.<\/p>\n<p>At least it was a hole we\u2019d made.<\/p>\n<p>That water was clear, and though we didn\u2019t know it, it connected directly to an underground river, the very aquifer we tapped for our drinking water.<\/p>\n<p>All along there was a river under the river.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve come to think of the place I grew up as a place where, if you\u2019re paying attention to the right stories, you can see the way different universes converge, with a turbulence that has a lot to teach us.<\/p>\n<p>There are many different rivers, all running over and under each other.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>There is the river of our settler imagination:<\/p>\n<p>The one that begins at the railroad crossing and goes by the name and logic of a small embankment, as well as a fortress.<span class=\"annotation\"><span

is a fortress: Outside of town, a group of Vietnam Veterans, calling themselves the Palisade Mountain Men has built a fortress and gathers here to reenact a romanticized version of \u201cfrontier times.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>That river is one of desire for control and conquest.<\/p>\n<p>A place to dredge and drain wetlands for farms. A place to take what we want, and to move it to where it can turn a profit. To draw maps that divide the county into saleable squares, giving each of them a name and owner.<\/p>\n<p>This is not exactly my grandfather\u2019s or my uncles\u2019 river. It belongs to the families \u201cout east\u201d who were the beneficiaries of this imagination, memorialized in historical museums by the sheer volume of what was extracted for profit.<\/p>\n<p>This is the river women like my mother are thrown into by force, and where so many bodies never surface.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>That is the river of our mothers and grandmothers who never learned to swim, but who survived in spite of the violence into which they were plunged.<\/p>\n<p>The river of our fear.<\/p>\n<p>The river we are part of imagining, in our submersion into movement\u2014all that is unseen and cannot be controlled, as well as what we hold onto, and the grace life gives us.<\/p>\n<p>Somehow, we feel our way back to standing.<\/p>\n<p>We learn how to tend to changing relationships, to know the moods of water and other bodies, and we meet the river under the river.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>And of course, there is the Ojibwe universe, or many.<\/p>\n<p>These are not for me to tell.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>At the Kickoff to the <em>Mississippi<\/em><em>. An Anthropocene River<\/em> project, Frank Bibeau, Dawn Goodwin, and others shared stories about the migration of Ojibwe people to and through this territory in canoes made of birch; and of the birchbark scrolls on which the rivers were threads connecting each body of water, not just lakes with names, but centers of a universe.<\/p>\n<p>Some of them, including the one many of us think of as \u201cthe source\u201d of the Mississippi, are known as false rivers.<\/p>\n<p>They do not begin where we might think, and are not easily traveled.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>Frank laughed when we asked about the source of the river.<\/p>\n<p>How we seemed obsessed with beginnings and endings.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>We trace routes that double as political borders or economic corridors, and draw those same boundaries on maps as well as on our hearts.<\/p>\n<p>What is the origin of our desire for a linear story?<\/p>\n<p>What is it about edges and crossings?<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>What if the submersions we\u2019ve survived are not about knowing beginnings and endings at all, but about finding meaning in the muck we meet between those worlds?<\/p>\n<p>Remembering that this moment is one source, unnameable.<\/p>\n<p>Learning to swim is movement within movement.<\/p>\n<p>What can you learn at the murky edge of a living river?<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>During the Kickoff to the <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em>, I explained to others what I believe it means to be <em>Riverine<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p>A riverine place, or a riverine person, is defined not by borders and boundaries, but by the mud she\u2019s wading into, all the water that moves through her, all the life that flourishes (or doesn\u2019t) there.<\/p>\n<p>A mud lark is someone who scavenges in river mud for things of value, which might be shards of porcelain, mussel shells, or her own life story.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/<\/p>\n<p>When I\u2019m looking for meaning in my mother\u2019s stories\u2014the stories I was steeped in, which became my own, however incomplete\u2014I like to give them a quarter-turn, looking at them like a mud lark might look at glass that\u2019s been polished by the flow of water and what it carries:<\/p>\n<p>What does this piece mean?
