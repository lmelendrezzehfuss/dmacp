This makes the student an extension of and an integral part of the modeling process.

Models are also a medium in which stories are contained and relayed. In short, models start from stories and tell stories. The story starts like this. Sustainability is a property that is found within our socioeconomic system and is bound by the limits of the physical systems of the Earth. It is a dynamic property in that it applies to the trajectory of the system. Therefore, in order to determine whether our current socioeconomic system has the property of sustainability, we need to be able to examine the system\u2019s future evolutionary paths.<\/p>\n<p>Sustainability is a concept that implicitly includes a time dynamic\u2014namely, it applies to the trajectory of a system. In order to determine whether a socioeconomic system has the property of sustainability, it is necessary to examine its future evolution path. However, the future evolution path, in part, will result from human activities that are subject to choices which will be made in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to examine possible evolution paths that are contingent upon societal choices.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"_3ngFjWKpOr0BV7e4JfgnKT\">\n<h3>Selected Participants\u2019 Feedback<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Hyr12l29RPHGMCN6zHqsG\">\n<div class=\"font-serif width-wide text-left columns-3\">The GSS model is neither predictive nor prescriptive; the idea is to identify the consequences of asking: \u201cWhat if I change this about the world?\u201d<br \/>\nGSS has a built-in model of the world\u2019s \u201cstocks and fluxes\u201d: population, food, durables, natural resources, forests, agricultural land, etc. The stocks and fluxes were calculated based on historical data that were collected by many institutions. The data is also present in the model, so that, for each quantity, you can plot a chronological graph. You cannot change this past, but you have a series of \u201ccontrol panels\u201d to visualize the \u201cfuture\u201d of this model. The default future is called \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d (BAU), and it includes four main \u201ctensions.\u201d A tension is an incompatibility between the required and the available stocks of something: crops, wood, energy, and labor are the quantities that undergo enormous tensions in the BAU future. You can modify this future and create alternative scenarios by visualizing and modifying the curves and by seeing what happens. [. . .] Something I discovered is a dramatic fall of wood availability in the near future. I didn\u2019t expect that. I always saw forests as an \u201cengine\u201d for photosynthesis, and therefore as a major factor influencing the composition of the atmosphere (by the way, atmosphere composition is not explicitly modeled in GSS). Instead, wood is required by humans for energy production and for constructions of all kinds. So much so that we cannot save the modeled trees without dramatically dropping the modeled society\u2019s demand for wood. It is not even enough to start planting and replanting forests everywhere because of the time lag implied for the trees to grow.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sustainability can indeed be achieved (most of the so-called \u201ctensions\u201d can be resolved in the context of the model). However, doing so requires a massive (and arguably impractical) reduction in per capita consumption and population.<\/li>\n<li>It was a (quantitative) revelation that even if we could effect immediate and significant changes in our societal values and transit to a low-consumption society, we would still not necessarily be able to nullify ecological overshoot for a significant amount of time.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3012,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:10","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:10","post_content":"","post_title":"Chris Strashok","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"chris-strashok","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:11:19","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:11:19","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/chris-strashok\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/chris-strashok\/","acf":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Strashok"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20719,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:51:20","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:51:20","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying transdisciplinary systems models to problems such as climate change or global food supply gives us useful heuristics while forcing us to think about complexity and to witness nonlinear and counterintuitive outcomes.<\/span><\/p>\n  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most Anthropocene concerns are \u201cwicked problems\u201d\u2014complex problems that defy a single answer and may never be solved definitively. Applying transdisciplinary systems models to problems such as climate change or global food supply gives us useful heuristics while forcing us to think about complexity and to witness nonlinear and counterintuitive outcomes.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201cwickedness\u201d of Anthropocene concerns arises because the problems it raises are hard to formulate, for several reasons. First, such problems involve competing interests (individual, corporate, state, etc.), each of which holds a different perspective on the nature of the problem. Second, problem framing and solutions to problems are interdependent: what counts as a solution depends on how the problem is framed, and vice versa. Third, the nature of the problem, the constraints, and the available resources can change over time. Finally, efforts to solve one aspect of a wicked problem often create new, unanticipated problems. The Anthropocene is rife with examples of wicked problems. Examples include anthropogenic climate change, loss of biodiversity, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, and global food supply. Complex, interlocking feedbacks\u2014both positive and negative\u2014make such problems difficult to understand conceptually and defy simple and effective solutions. These problems also defy experimentation that could lead to a better grasp of potential solutions. The seminar focused on applying systems thinking to wicked problems, which involves gathering knowledge from many disciplines for aggregation at a higher level. Various models were used to work through solving examples of wicked problems. This facilitated a partial, somewhat abstract, but holistic grasp of problems and methods used to seek solutions that require interdisciplinary perspectives.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Modeling Wicked Problems","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-modelling-wicked-problems","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-02 18:03:54","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-02 16:03:54","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20719","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-modelling-wicked-problems\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":23600,"id":23600,"title":"HKW_Modeling Wicked Problems","filename":"HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","filesize":1954821,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-modelling-wicked-problems\/hkw_modeling-wicked-problems\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_modeling-wicked-problems","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20719,"date":"2020-04-02 15:58:24","modified":"2020-04-02 15:58:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":7810,"height":5454,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":536,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":210,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":536,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":978,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1073,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1430,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":34,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1117}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying transdisciplinary systems models to problems such as climate change or global food supply gives us useful heuristics while forcing us to think about complexity and to witness nonlinear and counterintuitive outcomes.<\/span><\/p>\n","contributors":[{"ID":3235,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:28","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:28","post_content":"","post_title":"Miriam Diamond","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"miriam-diamond","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:38:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:38:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/miriam-diamond\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/miriam-diamond\/","acf":{"first_name":"Miriam ","last_name":"Diamond"}},{"ID":3263,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:30","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:30","post_content":"","post_title":"Paul N.
