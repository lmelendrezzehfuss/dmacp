The Strategy, in part, will guide the transition of the RBGV\u2019s selection of plantings into one that is more suitable for the projected climatic conditions of 2090.<\/p>\n<p>Midway through the Anthropocene Campus, Melbourne, about twenty participants travelled south of the city center and the Yarra River, to land now known as the Melbourne Gardens of the RBGV. First established in 1846 and now covering an area of thirty-six hectares, the RBGV houses thousands of plants in their living collection and approximately 1.5 million dried plant and fungi specimens in the National Herbarium of Victoria. After gathering at the visitor center, Den, our guide for the Aboriginal Heritage Walk, greeted us and asked everyone their name and where they were from\u2014a gesture that made the whole group implicitly aware of its shared status as (uninvited) guests. The Aboriginal Heritage Walk is a recurring event promoted by the RBGV that aims to highlight the histories and living cultures of the traditional owners of the land. The first stop on our walk was the Oak Lawn, which was established throughout the nineteenth century with the planting of oak species from Europe, Asia, and America. It was here, surrounded by these non-native trees planted by early colonizers, that we were formally welcomed to the land of the Wurundjeri people by Den, an Aboriginal elder whose own ancestry lies in country (referring to lands and waters, as well as seasons, stories, and spirits) further north. In this way, we were all convening on this land as visitors, though having arrived through strikingly different trajectories. Den lit a small fire while explaining the significance of different plants in smoking ceremonies. Having given each of us a eucalyptus leaf, he invited each of us in turn to approach to add our leaf to the flames and circle the fire while waving the fragrant smoke over ourselves. Den then guided us through another part of the garden, stopping periodically as he taught us how to see and appreciate the qualities and uses of particular plants. After our walk, we again gathered on the Oak Lawn where cups of lemon myrtle tea were distributed to everyone and Den and his young assistant spoke of the broader context of what we had experienced. Holding up a map of Aboriginal Australia, one of them pointed to where we were, on the land of one nation among hundreds of others. They then held up the Aboriginal Flag and explained its significance: black represents the people, yellow the sun, and red the earth.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":11817,"id":11817,"title":"E_Lara_1","filename":"E_Lara_1.jpg","filesize":1097438,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/interspecies-accomplices-cultivating-conspiracy-at-the-royal-botanic-gardens-victoria\/e_lara_1\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Photograph by Elizabeth Lara","caption":"Curator of Horticulture Peter Symes speaks to the group near Guilfoyle's Volcano.","name":"e_lara_1","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":11816,"date":"2019-09-19 15:48:24","modified":"2020-04-28 15:51:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2500,"height":1874,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1-768x576.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":576,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1-300x225.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":225,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1-768x576.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":576,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1-1400x1049.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":1049,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1151,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1535,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/E_Lara_1-1600x1200.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>After lunch, we met with two employees of the RBGV: landscape architect Andrew Laidlaw and Curator of Horticulture Peter Symes.

While extremely important, one might view the incorporation of an Aboriginal Heritage Walk into the formal program of the Gardens\u2014along with the Australia-specific gesture of acknowledging country at public events, or the adoption of the Aboriginal flag as an official flag of Australia\u2014as a dubious concession, comparable to that of the slavemaster granting slaves the land to keep a garden. In processing our experience in the Gardens, there is perhaps a justifiable temptation to construct an opposition between the voices we heard. Perhaps an open question would be more generative, bearing in mind that the plantations which once housed slave gardens no longer exist: What future worlds are being invited when space is made for a young Aboriginal man to raise his flag in a colonial garden?<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":11829,"id":11829,"title":"Lara_4","filename":"Lara_4.jpg","filesize":980829,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/interspecies-accomplices-cultivating-conspiracy-at-the-royal-botanic-gardens-victoria\/lara_4\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Photograph by Elizabeth Lara","caption":"The Aboriginal flag, raised at the closing of the Aboriginal Heritage Walk.","name":"lara_4","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":11816,"date":"2019-09-19 15:55:13","modified":"2020-04-28 15:51:04","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2500,"height":1875,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4-768x576.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":576,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4-300x225.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":225,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4-768x576.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":576,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4-1400x1050.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":1050,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1152,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1536,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Lara_4-1600x1200.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1200}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<h1>Further reading:<\/h1>\n<p>Myers, Natasha, From the Anthropocene to the Planthroposcene: Designing Gardens for Plant\/People Involution,\u00a0<em>History and Anthropology<\/em>, vol. 28, no. 3 (2017), pp. 1\u20135.<\/p>\n<p>Moreton-Robinson, Aileen,\u00a0<em>The White Possessive: Property, Power and Indigenous Sovereignty<\/em>.
