Slow Media aims to exercise the brain, slowly taking in and digesting ideas. As outlined in the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.slow-media.net\/manifesto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slow Media Manifesto<\/a>. Slow Media links media use today (which often comes with a feeling of the disconnectedness of connected technology, as represented in the internet of things) to the Slow Food movement. The concept of Slow Media builds on the idea of slow violence. The term was coined by Rob Nixon,<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Rob Nixon,\u00a0<em>Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor<\/em>.

Place and timing can affect people\u2019s understanding of \u201cglobal\u201d events.<\/p>\n<p>Does the local become planetary in scale? For seminar leader Libby Robin, the global imaginary of the Anthropocene demands a sense of global citizenship and a consciousness that includes an observer\u2019s great-grandparents and their great-children. One way to make the idea of slowing down both concrete and accessible is through extending our understanding of the museum as a place that exhibits and preserves art objects. One way of doing so is Ellie Irons\u2019 \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/a-slobjects-exercise-whats-in-our-pockets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Slobjects Exercise: \u2018What\u2019s in Our Pockets?<\/a>\u2019\u201d; another is Ally Bisshop and Yesenia Thibault-Picazo\u2019s exchange on the ways of mapping Slow Media, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/mapping-an-exercise-in-cartography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mapping: An Exercise on Cartography<\/a>\u201d. To understand how to situate oneself within the Anthropocene, the group Soren Dahlgaard, Judith Dobler, Paz Guevera, John Moran, Isabel P\u00e9rez, and Hugo Reinert take off from a strong image of industrialization, colonialization, and agriculture: the fence. The resources, practices, infrastructures, and means that evolve around fence-building are revealed by several contributions gathered under \u201cDeconstructing Fences\u201d. In her reflection \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/alternatives-to-global-challenges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alternatives to Global Challenges<\/a>,\u201d Stella Veciana addresses the topic of destabilizing effects on long-standing concepts, narratives, and assumptions, while Anna \u00c5berg and Hugo Almeida focus on new perspectives on the Anthropocene that are revealed by other media such as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/comics-and-graphic-novels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comics and Graphic Novels<\/a>.\u201d Helmuth Trischler\u2019s contribution describes an exemplary exhibition: \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/inside-the-museum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inside the Museum: A Curator\u2019s View on the History of the Anthropocene<\/a>\u201d demonstrates the exhibition architecture he curated. What would a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/museum-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Museum Library<\/a>\u201d look like in an imaginary museum that dedicates itself to the Slow Media practice? John Moran lists an exemplary network of vital categories. The imaginary museum opens up a speculative space for engaging, and reflecting on how to engage aesthetically with the Anthropocene, assembling different approaches from the arts and sciences. One imaginary example of addressing the Anthropocene is the project \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/fairweatherfundation.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anti Cyclones: A New Investment Paradigm<\/a>\u201d by the Fair Weather Foundation, which offers a model merchandise of sustainable products.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":false,"projects":[{"ID":20683,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:06:10","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:06:10","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grasping the Anthropocene demands a sense of deceleration\u2014we need \u201cslow media\u201d that by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The Imaginary Museum of Listening to the Anthropocene <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grasping the Anthropocene demands a sense of deceleration\u2014we need \u201cslow media\u201d that by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects.

The idea of the Anthropocene demands thinking about a Long Now\u2014that is, not just a single human lifetime but up to seven generations, as suggested by <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/longnow.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Long Now Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To this we added the global imaginary, the Big Here: the local is now planetary in scale. An Anthropocene imaginary demands a sense of global citizenship and a consciousness on the part of an observer that includes their great-grandparents and their great-children. Having a \u201cglobal soul\u201d (to use Pico Iyer\u2019s term) and dwelling across generations stretches and stresses the human sense of self. The idea of doing such imagining at a slower pace in a physical place or with real objects, offers an alternative to the \u201csound bite\u201d approach to communicating complex ideas. One way to make the idea of slowing down concrete and accessible is through extending our understanding of the museum as a place that exhibits and preserves objects and artifacts. With the idea of an imaginary museum that holds individual objects and collections the seminar wants to offer new tools not only for people working in museums, but for everyone seeking alternative ways to educate students and citizens to think about global change and ways of living in the Anthropocene.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Slow
