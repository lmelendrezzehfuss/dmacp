a cartographic exercise, \u201cMapping Slow Media\u201d was not intended to complete and close the circuit of possibilities for inclusion under the umbrella of Slow Media. Rather, the intention was to generate an expanded conceptual framework for thinking about how such a map might be figured, and what its terms, nodes, and ground might be. We use the idea of the map Gregory Bateson explores in Steps to an <em>Ecology of Mind<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p><em>Let us go back to the map and the territory and ask: \u2018What is it in the territory that gets onto the map?\u2019 We know the territory does not get onto the map.

What we began sketching is a map of difference, both actualized and virtual or potential. A map of the ways in which to think Slow Media is to think differently. The \u201cSlow Media\u201d mapping exercise began with an analysis of its two constituent terms:<\/p>\n<h1>What is slow?<br \/>\nWhat is media?<\/h1>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>The slowness of Slow Media can be read in a number of ways. In one reading, it suggests something of a slowing down to the space and rhythm of an attentive encounter. Here, slowness speaks to a deceleration of one\u2019s subjective sense of time, in order that we might open up to the possibilities provided by a contemplative engagement with ideas and theory. It also references the slowness that is required to digest and process the complex information and ideas communicated through these media, and the length of time that might be needed for a novel understanding to fully emerge from the ideas and questions that they pose. Additionally, slowness might speak to an ability of Slow Media to express or communicate expanded timescales: epochs and durations that exceed the human time frame, and that might encompass distal pasts and distant speculative or possible futures.<\/p>\n<p>What constitutes a medium in the framework of Slow Media is a key constituent of this mapping project. There exist a multitude of organic and inorganic matter, objects, symbols, processes, movements, rhythms, and spaces that can be read as media\u2014that is, as being inscribed (or inscribable) with information, ideas, or stories. These \u201cother\u201d media forms are those that exceed purely textual or figural media, that exceed mathematically or scientifically encoded forms, and that are not necessarily predicated on linear and visual narratives. Examples discussed included rocks\u2014both Neolithic and specifically Anthropocenic (e.g. Trinitite, a rock formed as a result of plutonium testing at the Trinity test site in New Mexico); soil and its many nutrient flows and dynamic feedback loops; architectural spaces (museological or otherwise); food systems; birdsong; sunlight; dance and performance; and spaces that provoke an entrainment of embodied rhythms. Here, the examples of \u201cother\u201d media generated in this exercise are in no way intended to represent an \u201cabsolute diagram\u201d of possible media forms, but to speak to the heterogeneity and complexity of the map itself.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of mapping a Slow Media of the Anthropocene, the language of the medium must also be expanded to include (perhaps even foreground) movements and processes as legitimate sites of media production, reception, and communication. In cartographic terms, this translates to a heightened attention to the arrows or lines (indicating movements or processual linkages) between objects on a map, rather than the objects themselves. Here, the objects might exist not as endpoints within the map, or as canonical descriptors of absolute media modes, but as spaces of contextual pause, which always lead us on to a multitude of other possible movements, transformations, and ideas. Importantly, different media forms also embed or express different ways of knowing or different ontological frameworks, as well as different languages or symbolic or semiotic indices. Further, they call for different modes of engagement and attention, in order that we might perceive or read them as \u201cmedia,\u201d and therein grasp something of what is being communicated.<\/p>\n<p>The expansion of the term media is important in trying to imagine a Slow Media that might have some agency in framing or reframing our collective approach to thinking the Anthropocene. Here, the expansion of media\u2014to include the extratextual, the nonhierarchical, the nonlinear\u2014might be that which opens us up to alternative ontologies, so that we might be able to thicken or recalibrate our approach to thinking through the suite of issues and questions posed by the Anthropocene. Donna Haraway has suggested: \u201cit matters to destabilize worlds of thinking with other worlds of thinking.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Donna Haraway, \u201cAnthropocene, Capitalocene, Cthulucene: Staying with the trouble,\u201d talk at University of California, Santa Cruz, May 9, 2014, <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/97663518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online<\/a> (accessed 12\/07\/2015).<\/span><\/span><\/span> Here is an imperative to reconstitute the language or media that frames our \u201cworlds of thinking,\u201d through an attempt to read the different forms of information given in an expanded realm of Slow Media. Haraway emphasizes the importance of \u201cdestabilization,\u201d which is required first in order to open onto other frameworks of reading, listening, thinking, and knowing. Within a new conception of Slow Media, and its request for an expansion of \u201clegible\u201d media forms, there is an implicit and necessary disruption and dissociation from normative modes of thinking and knowing. The disruptive is then a key agent in the idea of Slow Media\u2014the shift required from habitual conceptions of media and from habitual modes of attending to them, the shift required to disengage from accelerative temporalities and modes of cognition.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":2943,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:03","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:03","post_content":"","post_title":"Ally Bisshop","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"ally-bisshop","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:31:45","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:31:45","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/ally-bisshop\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/ally-bisshop\/","acf":{"first_name":"Ally ","last_name":"Bisshop"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20683,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:06:10","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:06:10","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grasping the Anthropocene demands a sense of deceleration\u2014we need \u201cslow media\u201d that by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The Imaginary Museum of Listening to the Anthropocene <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grasping the Anthropocene demands a sense of deceleration\u2014we need \u201cslow media\u201d that by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects.

The idea of the Anthropocene demands thinking about a Long Now\u2014that is, not just a single human lifetime but up to seven generations, as suggested by <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/longnow.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Long Now Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To this we added the global imaginary, the Big Here: the local is now planetary in scale. An Anthropocene imaginary demands a sense of global citizenship and a consciousness on the part of an observer that includes their great-grandparents and their great-children. Having a \u201cglobal soul\u201d (to use Pico Iyer\u2019s term) and dwelling across generations stretches and stresses the human sense of self. The idea of doing such imagining at a slower pace in a physical place or with real objects, offers an alternative to the \u201csound bite\u201d approach to communicating complex ideas. One way to make the idea of slowing down concrete and accessible is through extending our understanding of the museum as a place that exhibits and preserves objects and artifacts. With the idea of an imaginary museum that holds individual objects and collections the seminar wants to offer new tools not only for people working in museums, but for everyone seeking alternative ways to educate students and citizens to think about global change and ways of living in the Anthropocene.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Slow
