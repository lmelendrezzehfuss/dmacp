However, based on the ecologies of practices they enlist, disciplines can also be thought of as particular ways of being affected. If, following Brian Massumi, we accept that affect is as much about a capacity to be affected as it is a capacity to affect and act in return, this poses larger, global questions when considering affect as a proposition for an anthropocenic re-assembling of disciplinary boundaries. What would a reframing of discipline offer our performance of research in a planetary context, in which being affected is an urgent political and ethical condition?<\/p>\n<p>The question: \u201cWhat is the Anthropocene?\u201d is still an unanswerable one. Despite the array of proposals for various \u201cmarkers\u201d for this geologic epoch\u2014from traces of Strontium 90 to the topographical stamps of plantations\u2014there is doubt about our capacity to adequately define this era, and its relation to planetary history. However, the Anthropocene certainly affects our practices as scholars, thinkers, and sentient beings. It forces us to reconsider our notions of time, nature, work, and the human. The demands of the Anthropocene do not operate only at the level of research presentation, but clash in the liminal realm of methods, devices, and concepts. In many ways, the Anthropocene does more than just resist our categorizations: it addresses what we mean by knowing, and enrolls us as cognizant beings in a world of multiple ontologies that exceed the human. We suggest that this blur should be taken as an opportunity: if we cannot \u201caddress the Anthropocene\u201d\u2014in the way that modern disciplines hoped to address objects situated in the world\u2014we must at least explore its contours. We begin, here, by paying attention to the ways in which the Anthropocene affects us. We prioritize the ways it moves us and demands our attention; we remain open to the questions it poses to our established convictions. Here, our ambition is not to define the Anthropocene, nor to affix its boundaries as an object of research. Rather, we propose a reinvigoration of experimental, creative practices as privileged processes of knowing, and a \u201cfollowing\u201d of materials that multiplies the repertoires in which we can speak about life in the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n<p>Crucially, our attention to creative experiments is an endeavor to revive experimentation as an open source ecological practice, and to equate it with experience once again. The separation of experience from experiment was a project of the Enlightenment, one that sought to strip the mythology of the personal (subjective) from the rational order and canon of scientific knowledge. Here, in parallel with an emergent hegemony of rational thought, an epistemological weight was ascribed to experiment stripped of its subjective character\u2014and thus denied its ability to respond to those experiential elements not yet quantifiable or describable by the language of logic.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Raymond Williams,<em> Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society.<\/em> Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1976, pp. 115\u201217.<\/span><\/span><\/span> Within this movement, the \u201cexperiment\u201d came to stand for first-order, observable, or reproducible qualia, with experience relegated to the position of secondary, internal, or subjective qualia.

What we mean by experiment has a different tenor: experimentation as that which places knowledge at risk, questions what we know and how we know it, and seeks to reinstate knowledge as grounded in subjective, self-reflexive, and transforming practices. Creative experiments are careful, exploratory engagements through which we follow, act, react, record, and trace the often-messy material convergences of concept, matter, and energy in the universe.<\/p>\n<p>Knowledge is in and of the world.

In creative experiments, knowledge is not the result, but that which is generated along the experimental process.

This is our opportunity to reconcile experience with experiment, to re-insert \u201cvalue\u201d into the experiential as a way of understanding and thinking about materials. Importantly, the experimental trajectory of material play is never predetermined by the \u201calready-givens\u201d of material science. This is not to suggest that material play blinds itself to empirical data or the mechanics of scientific experimentation; rather, these scientific givens offer up a set of conditions through which such play might emerge. Here, the endless treatise, methodologies, and theoretical data with which scientific experimentation has gifted us exist as invitations; as nominative thresholds to be tested, probed, and manipulated through a playful interaction with materials, which seek to link that empirical data with an experiential knowledge\u2014embodied, intuited, unfolding. What is offered is the experimental possibility of bringing together first- and second-order qualia at the level of enquiry, and a re-formulation of objects and method, such that each communicates the same thing, through the condition of raw experience.<\/p>\n<h1>Feeling\/Following<\/h1>\n<p>Given the difficulties that the Anthropocene poses, we propose the creative experiment as a process of discovery. At its heart lies a radical openness that makes it possible for the researcher to engage with his or her chosen object of study without being bound-up in and limited by pre-established grids of knowledge. In this section, we draw from Henri Bergson to help articulate the nuanced ways in which we, as researchers, hope to creatively experiment with the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n<p><em>In Matter and Memory<\/em> (2004), Bergson argues that a purely rational reading of material and space limits us only to the realm of what is already known. Our normative reading of material and space is subtractive: from the wealth of information, movement, and change given in and of our milieu and relations, we tend to extract only those elements of which we estimate that we can make some functional use.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Henri Bergson, <em>Matter and Memory<\/em>, tr.

New York: Dover Publications, 2004, p. 30.<\/span><\/span><\/span> To overcome these dominant narratives\u2014that is, to shift beyond the limits of a purely logical and linear reading of materials and milieu\u2014requires a twist in our perceptual frames and devices, such that we are able to attend to something other.<\/p>\n<p>For Bergson, the primary method of attuning and attending to this otherness was his concept of intuition, which he attempted to elevate to the level of scientific method by gifting intuition its own precise methodology.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Bergson, Henri,\u00a0<em>The Creative Mind: An introduction to metaphysics<\/em>, tr.

New York, NY: Zone Books, 1991, p. 13.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here, intuition as a method broadly asks for a process of thinking and attending which is located in the flow and rhythm of duration\u2014that is, in the subjective experience of the passage of time. It is here, by attending to the internal rhythm of one\u2019s own duration, that Bergson claims we are able to move outward, and seek a sympathetic resonance with the rhythm of the objects, materials, and elements surrounding us. This sympathetic durational resonance is at the heart of an intuitive understanding of matter and material. It is here, also, that we might locate a different basis for perceptual selection and reification in creative experiments and material play, guided by intuitive resonance rather than by utility or habit. Importantly, an intuitive understanding of material is underwritten by the condition of primary, sensory experience: experience as it happens, experience prior to logical codification, experience as it emerges in the passage of time. Creative experiments and material play thus require a different kind of attention, one that moves beyond the filters normatively imposed on one\u2019s perceptual framework by the hegemonic tropes of linearity, utility, and habit. This kind of creative play both enables and requires a shift in perceptual hierarchies, such that we can attend equally to the minor and the peripheral, the occluded and the \u201cuseless,\u201d the mutating and the fleeting. In breaking with these filters\u2014in attending to an excluded otherness\u2014we are able to open onto possibilities for experimentation that are guided by intuition, sensation, and experience. We are able to draw from the realm of the \u201cunknown.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Creative experiments, for us, are fundamentally about feeling and\u00a0<em>following<\/em>\u00a0materials. Embedded in this logic is our conviction that the Anthropocene obliges us to think of knowledge without the schema of traditional disciplinary frameworks: it invites us to invent different\u00a0<em>ad hoc<\/em>\u00a0disciplinary paths and diagrams, to multiply them, to follow new or ancient grains in the textures of thought. This, to us, is less a methodology than a procedure of discovery.<\/p>\n<p>We take inspiration from what makers and artisans have always done: splitting timber, for instance, \u201cis a question of surrendering to the wood and following where it leads.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, <em>A Thousand Plateaus.<\/em> New York, NY: Zone Books, 2004, p. 451.<\/span><\/span><\/span> As Tim Ingold argues, to describe the properties of things in a processual world is to describe their stories as they flow and metamorphose.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Tim Ingold, \u201cMaterials against materiality,\u201d <em>Archaeological Dialogues<\/em>, vol. 14, no. 1 (2007): pp. 1\u201216.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Breaking with \u201cmethods\u201d whose aim is to purify phenomena by isolating them from \u201cbackground noise,\u201d following is to embark on a quest through the Anthropocene in its open-ended multiplicity.

Rather than trying to resolve these, creative experimentation and material play identifies the shifting contours within which the Anthropocene is made explicit.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFollowing,\u201d as an orientation for research, is also resonant with the ethos of Isabelle Stengers\u2019 metaphor of the \u201csolitary hunter.\u201d According to Stengers, the solitary hunter \u201ctakes his time\u201d; the art of the solitary hunt is <em>\u201cempathy.\u201d<\/em><span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Isabelle Stengers, <em>Power and Invention: Situating Science<\/em>.

The task of the hunter\/huntress is to suspend his or her own logic in order to be radically open to the logic of the \u201cprey.\u201d This meaning of feeling\/ following articulates our methodological affinity for research that is as much about apprehending the trajectory of specific concepts (e.g. kinds of pain, or affective atmospheres) as it is about tracing the many impressions of these concepts in a \u201cmilieu,\u201d or \u201cfield.\u201d An empathic practice of \u201cfeeling into\u201d requires a shift in the understanding of our roles as researchers, and of what is possible within these roles.
