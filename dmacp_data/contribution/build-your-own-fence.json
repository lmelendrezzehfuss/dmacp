Pick one that speaks to you, for whatever reason\u2014you may find it interesting or problematic; perhaps it sparks your imagination, or you\u2019d like to learn more about it, or you think it\u2019s important, or you have stories that you want to tell about it. Let your imagination run free: your segment might be real or imaginary, abstract or specific, past or present or future. It could be the border between two countries, a medieval fortification, a ruined wall in the woods outside your childhood home. The only criterion here is that it should interest you.<\/p>\n<p>This segment is going to be your contribution to the fence your group is constructing. You\u2019re going to draw it and connect it to the other segments, so they form a chain. First, however, you\u2019ll want to think about the stories you want your segment to tell. Who built it, and why? What is its purpose? What does it do? Does it keep someone or something out? Or in? What does it divide, and why? Why was it important to build it, and to whom? What does it allow people to do\u2014or stop them from doing? What problems does it solve\u2014or create? Will it exist in a thousand years? Will people remember it? Will they destroy it? What interests you about this fence? Why do you think it\u2019s important?<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided what to say with your segment of the fence, you should draw it\u2014perhaps on a sheet of paper\u2014in such a way that it can connect to the others. Use whatever means you\u2019re comfortable with. You might use words, drawing or paint, dates, word balloons, shapes cut out from paper. You can draw on memories or facts, quotes or statistics. Once the segments are connected, step back and admire your handiwork. If you want, you can each take turns explaining your own segment\u2014why you chose it, what it means to you, why you think it\u2019s important\u2014and commenting on the others.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>Alternate Fence Exercise: Reflections on Fences in your Life (individual exercise)<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Think of different types of fences you have encountered in your life (preferably, but not necessarily, physical, material ones).<\/li>\n<li>Choose a fence you encounter in your daily life and list at least five of the implications you think it has (for you, for other humans, for animals, as a cultural tool, as a material entity\u2026)<\/li>\n<li>Before building a fence, what it is that you want to fence (keep in\/keep out)?<\/li>\n<li>In relation to what you want to keep in\/out, decide on the materials you need to use: how resistant\/impenetrable\/permeable\/sharp\/soft\u2026 do you wish your fence to be?<\/li>\n<li>Sit and think (preferably before constructing the fence!) about the consequences your fence will have.<\/li>\n<li>Do you still want to build the fence?<\/li>\n<li>If yes, arrange your materials and set up the
