More specifically, this rigidized balloon, named Echo II, was sent into low-level atmospheric orbit to relay signals between distant points on Earth. Other satellites affiliated with the Echo, Telstar, and similar programs likewise supported the transmission of fax images, telephone calls, television images, and feeds, etc., thereby refiguring and consolidating the world\u2014rendering it more \u201csolid [. . .] through its tightly woven interrelations.\u201d Many key thinkers at the time celebrated the increased connectivity ushered in by the expansion of communication networks and electronic media, not to mention commercial airline travel. Marshall McLuhan, for instance, famously characterized this reordered world as a new \u201cglobal village,\u201d wherein breaking news was instantaneously available across the planet\u2019s reach. Others, however, took a more negative view, lamenting the growing impossibility of potential detachment, or autonomy, in a society increasingly enveloped by various circuitry. As a historical artifact, this technological sphere reminds us that the world proceeds by way of precise developments, and it would do us well to remember the past, in its peculiar complexity, as we navigate the present. As an apparatus\u2014and one, like so many others, which emerged from a military\u2012geopolitical context\u2014Echo II prefigured and enabled our world today, wherein the global economy operates with unprecedented power and swiftness. We might, in fact, think of the shipping container\u2014as it plies the world\u2019s oceans aboard sublime-scaled barges, carrying endless goods according to endless financial transactions\u2014as some sort of correlate or derivative, especially if we take seriously filmmakers Allan Sekula and No\u00ebl Burch\u2019s claim in\u00a0<em>The Forgotten Space<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Allen Sekula and Noel Burch,\u00a0The Forgotten Space: A Film Essay Seeking to Understand the Contemporary Maritime World in Relation to the Symbolic Legacy of the Sea.

As a form, it embodies the idea of the world as a single unit\u2014unified by technology, by globalized capitalism, by environmental crisis, and so on. And, more pertinent for Anthropocene discussions, of the human as world and the world as human. That we have largely remade the world in our own image is clear: land is increasingly homogenized by corporate, genetically modified agriculture; urbanization expands in a fashion some describe as \u201cplanetary,\u201d or without outside; biodiversity is plummeting, with those species domesticated or oddly adaptable to human-centered environs (e.g. coyotes, seagulls, cockroaches, certain bacteria) among the few to expand in numbers, like we ourselves. For many of us, there is a sense of entanglement in something so big and accelerated that it seems impossible to identify its edges or ways of extracting ourselves, of finding external places on which to \u201cpitch our tent,\u201d to again borrow Serres\u2019 analogy. The word \u201cAnthropocene,\u201d of course, is meant to capture some of this. Yet, we should also be wary of this concept, including the wildfire pace with which it is being adopted. For broad, planetary frames\u2014like the satellite view from above\u2014have a tendency to subsume particularities into totalities, with the risk of naturalizing, or depoliticizing, states of affairs along the way. The geological dimension of the Anthropocene term only exacerbates this. As the environmental justice scholar Nicholas Brown once meaningfully posed to me, echoing many others\u2019 concerns: What human inequities and violences are smoothed over when we think in terms of deep, rather than historical, time? There is a particular opacity to anthropogenic climate change, one of the defining phenomena of our purported Anthropocene condition, a way in which representation itself is thrown newly into crisis in its midst. Pictures of polar bears atop icebergs, industrial smokestacks, the vast stretches of the Tar Sands in Alberta, Canada, and other devastated landscapes\u2014all these remain, somehow, too linked to a literal, illustrative mode, unable to convey the multiplicity, relationality, and indeed opacity, of it all. One of the key questions we might ask ourselves is how to see and think, relentlessly, the geological and ecological together with the social, economic, political, and ethical, while keeping issues of power and justice always center stage. How to resist images of wholeness in favor of fractured, or stratified, viewpoints that foreground difference?<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3054,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:13","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:13","post_content":"","post_title":"Emily Eliza Scott","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"emily-eliza-scott","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:01:40","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:01:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/emily-eliza-scott\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/emily-eliza-scott\/","acf":{"first_name":"Emily Eliza","last_name":"Scott"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20733,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:57:12","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:57:12","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene remains peculiarly flat and colorless when it comes to concrete images, which are lacking cultural nuance and historical depth.

Today it presents itself in scientific images as planetary boundaries and limits to growth, as an age when human interventions on the planet call for a great transformation. But in a much wider sense, transformation, utopia, collapse and ambition, reflection and bewilderment have long been topics of human relationships with the landscape, large and small. This can be seen in works of art as well as in science: images of landscapes, or indeed the entire Earth, express topics of metamorphosis, of power, economy, security, and appropriation. They also express fantasies about the wild, the other\u2014and about possible alternatives to present-day ways of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of the seminar was to explore existing images of the Earth and the Anthropocene, and to extend the scope further to include imaginaries of alternative futures. Participants engaged with ways in which a transformed, warmer, less stable, highly utilized world might see changes in social patterns, ways of life, and culture that go much deeper than what is commonly discussed. Exploratory, imaginary engagement with anthropogenically altered landscapes in a possible future presented sharp new perspectives on the Anthropocene and its implications in areas such as architecture and art.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Imaging the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-14 18:23:57","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-14 16:23:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20733","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":23593,"id":23593,"title":"HKW_Imaging the Anthropocene","filename":"HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","filesize":327981,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\/hkw_maging-the-anthropocene\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_maging-the-anthropocene","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20733,"date":"2020-04-02 15:55:34","modified":"2020-04-02 15:57:00","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1589,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-768x477.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":477,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-300x186.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":186,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-768x477.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":477,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1400x869.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":869,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1536x953.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":953,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1271,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1600x993.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":993}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene remains peculiarly flat and colorless when it comes to concrete images, which are lacking cultural nuance and historical depth.
