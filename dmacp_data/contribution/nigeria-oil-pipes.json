pipe runs through Ikarama, Nigeria.<\/p>\n<p>Hundreds of oil spills occur yearly in the Niger River Delta, destroying the livelihoods of fishing communities. Amnesty International reports that Shell\u2019s claims that these spills occur from oil theft are unfounded. Other news outlets report that in 2014 youth in Ikarama began sabotaging the pipe that runs through their communities. Filling one\u2019s own community with the terror of toxins becomes a weapon for the weak in the Anthropocene; as human crude runs the cities of the North along border fences drawn by imperialism.<\/p>\n<p>Spills form pockets of oil not crossable, like the fences that surround the compounds with names like Dallas, where Shell employees land and leave with helicopters.<\/p>\n<p>Hydroimperialism, and the draining and reclaiming of swamps for capital, the reworking of deltas and the specter of extraction, is one of the Anthropocene\u2019s stories.<\/p>\n<p>As Timothy Mitchell writes, the politics, economies, and social relations of our worlds are engineered through energy flows.
