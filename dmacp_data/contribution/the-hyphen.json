Our visual design went through several stages and refinements. We chose a circular frame for its holistic form and we bisected it with a ground line to balance the above and below. We animated the image in order to add a sense of life. This was done with pre-twentieth-century technology\u2014the thaumatrope. We were able to record this on an iPhone and screen it to the seminar as part of our presentation on the second day. Our final thaumatrope is the hyphen made visual, a semi-abstract pulse of life, matter, and cosmic energies in the universe.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3191,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:24","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:24","post_content":"","post_title":"Maialen Galarraga (Maia)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"maialen-galarraga-maia","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:46:51","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:46:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/maialen-galarraga-maia\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/maialen-galarraga-maia\/","acf":{"first_name":"Maialen","last_name":"Galarraga "}},{"ID":3314,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:36","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:36","post_content":"","post_title":"Sasha Engelmann","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"sasha-engelmann","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:05:23","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:05:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/sasha-engelmann\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/sasha-engelmann\/","acf":{"first_name":"Sasha","last_name":"Engelmann"}},{"ID":3010,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:08","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:08","post_content":"","post_title":"Chip Lord","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"chip-lord","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:19:16","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:19:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/chip-lord\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/chip-lord\/","acf":{"first_name":"Chip","last_name":"Lord"}},{"ID":3224,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:27","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:27","post_content":"","post_title":"Max Stocklosa","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"max-stocklosa","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:44:14","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:44:14","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/max-stocklosa\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/max-stocklosa\/","acf":{"first_name":"Max ","last_name":"Stocklosa"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20733,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:57:12","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:57:12","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene remains peculiarly flat and colorless when it comes to concrete images, which are lacking cultural nuance and historical depth.

New imaginaries and imaginations are needed to engage with alternative futures of infrastructure and anthropogenically altered landscapes.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of the Anthropocene has resonated in Western cultures since at least the nineteenth century. Today it presents itself in scientific images as planetary boundaries and limits to growth, as an age when human interventions on the planet call for a great transformation. But in a much wider sense, transformation, utopia, collapse and ambition, reflection and bewilderment have long been topics of human relationships with the landscape, large and small. This can be seen in works of art as well as in science: images of landscapes, or indeed the entire Earth, express topics of metamorphosis, of power, economy, security, and appropriation. They also express fantasies about the wild, the other\u2014and about possible alternatives to present-day ways of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of the seminar was to explore existing images of the Earth and the Anthropocene, and to extend the scope further to include imaginaries of alternative futures. Participants engaged with ways in which a transformed, warmer, less stable, highly utilized world might see changes in social patterns, ways of life, and culture that go much deeper than what is commonly discussed. Exploratory, imaginary engagement with anthropogenically altered landscapes in a possible future presented sharp new perspectives on the Anthropocene and its implications in areas such as architecture and art.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Imaging the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-14 18:23:57","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-14 16:23:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20733","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":23593,"id":23593,"title":"HKW_Imaging the Anthropocene","filename":"HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","filesize":327981,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\/hkw_maging-the-anthropocene\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_maging-the-anthropocene","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20733,"date":"2020-04-02 15:55:34","modified":"2020-04-02 15:57:00","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1589,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-768x477.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":477,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-300x186.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":186,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-768x477.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":477,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1400x869.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":869,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1536x953.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":953,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1271,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1600x993.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":993}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene remains peculiarly flat and colorless when it comes to concrete images, which are lacking cultural nuance and historical depth.
