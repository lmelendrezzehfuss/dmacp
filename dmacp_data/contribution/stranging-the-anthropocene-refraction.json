In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Romantic thinkers began to criticize the scientific approach of the Enlightenment for its treatment of man and nature as mutable, reducible, and disenchanted entities\u2014masters and slaves. In contrast, Romantic attempts to rediscover society\u2019s lost unity with the natural world came to idealize the \u201cother\u201d as a source of understanding of our place in that world, rather than our mastery over it. Authors such as Adelbert von Chamisso combined mythical tales on the workings of nature with the travelogues of diligent Humboldtian naturalists, encouraging us to rediscover our wanderlust, and our ability to wonder and discover. On the other hand, the Romantic fascination with otherness, the sublime, or the uncanny also led to a renewed politics of marginalization and abuse. It was in this period that industrialization and colonization moved ahead, laying the foundations of the global technological society.<\/p>\n<h1>To wander and wonder \u2026<\/h1>\n<p>To bridge the historical distance between nineteenth-century colonial Romanticism and twenty-first-century technospheric Romanticism, we take several intermediary intellectual stopovers. During the first stop, we provisionally take on the position of bourgeois <em>fl\u00e2neurs<\/em>, as they appear in Baudelaire\u2019s Paris; as \u201cpassionate spectator[s], [for whom] it is an immense joy [\u2026] to see the world, to be at the center of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world,\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Charles Baudelaire, <em>The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays<\/em>, tr.

Following Georg Simmel, Benjamin understands the uneasiness of the urban panorama of social life to stem from its \u201cmarked preponderance of visual activity over aural activity\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Walter Benjamin, \u201cThe Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire,\u201d in <em>Selected Writings: Volume 4 1938\u20131940<\/em>, ed.

By first disarticulating the aurality, visuality, and temporality of Westhafen-Moabit, and then re-collaging them together, we explore what can be regained through aesthetic experiences of the technosphere\u2019s local manifestation.<\/p>\n<h1>Open, closed, sparse \u2026<\/h1>\n<p>A second halt brings us to the attempts of systems thinkers in the 1960s, aimed at dissolving the place opposite that of our environment altogether. At that time, systems ecologists and cyberneticists searched for alternatives to species-based and geographically limited classification schemes for vegetation.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">See, for example, Francis Raymond Fosberg, A Classification of Vegetation for General Purposes. Section IPB\/CT (Conservation of Terrestrial Communities), International Biological Programme (IPB), 1967<\/span><\/span><\/span> Their attempts brought about a new focus on abstraction: on structure and basic functions independent of taxonomy and topography (and materiality) that we picked up on in our contribution. Their classifications did not depend on floristic criteria or particular plant species. Rather, they aimed at capturing the physiognomy, the vegetational arrangement in space: whether it was open, closed, or sparse. They purposefully avoided the incorporation of place-specific environmental information, such as climatic or geographic details, into their vegetation categories. In this way, they hoped to generate new fundamental knowledge without drawing premature conclusions about the functioning of systems or communities from isolated elements. We share in these attempts to rethink the regimentation of inherited epistemes, and to look again at the ontological division between nature and machinery. In this, our gaze is led by interesting spatial arrangements and structures, rather than by any a priori distinction between types of matter or substance.<\/p>\n<p>Juxtaposing the Romantic ambitions of unknowing the familiar and rediscovering the mundane with the cybernetic attempts to reconceptualize the distinction between nature and technology (or the lack thereof), our contribution to the \u201cRomancing the Anthropocene\u201d seminar combines video, sound, and image material that we collected during our field exercise in Berlin\u2019s Westhafen shipping district.<\/p>\n<p>In recording the industrially generated techno-biodiversity of the port district, we suggest new perspectives and ways of breaking up and opening rigid classification systems that capture and limit the knowledge of our environment in perhaps obsolete ways. As we consider the problematics of our subject positions, our creative repurposing of the sensory experience in an industrial transportation hub during springtime is an attempt at subversion. We attempt to inflect our wandering contemplation, collection, and reconfiguration of aesthetic practices that go some way towards recuperating a Romantic taxonomical project.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":""}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3291,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:34","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:34","post_content":"","post_title":"Rohini Devasher","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"rohini-devasher","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:13:27","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:13:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/rohini-devasher\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/rohini-devasher\/","acf":{"first_name":"Rohini ","last_name":"Devasher"}},{"ID":3157,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:22","post_content":"","post_title":"Joseph Pfender","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"joseph-pfender","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 15:11:41","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 13:11:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/joseph-pfender\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/joseph-pfender\/","acf":{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"Pfender"}},{"ID":3324,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:36","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:36","post_content":"","post_title":"Simone Schleper","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"simone-schleper","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:07:21","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:07:21","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/simone-schleper\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/simone-schleper\/","acf":{"first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Schleper"}}],"projects":[{"ID":19740,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2016-04-23 14:02:31","post_date_gmt":"2016-04-23 12:02:31","post_content":"<p>Tracing shadows\u2014an examination of technological datasets and Romantic concepts in the study area of Berlin-Moabit.<\/p>\n Urban Diffractions of the Technosphere <p>Tracing shadows\u2014an examination of technological datasets and Romantic concepts in the study area of Berlin-Moabit.<\/p>\n <p>The seminar begins with the curious tale of Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man, as a trope for contemporary urban diffractions of the Technosphere. Written in 1814 by the Berlin\u2010based botanist and Romantic novelist, Adelbert von Chamisso, the tale of the shadowless man casts a critical light on issues of capitalism, mobility, scientific advancement, social responsibility, and statelessness and immigration\u2014then as now. As the story goes, the hero trades his shadow, and thus his existence and identity, to the devil for limitless wealth; only to be shunned by society. After a period of inevitable philanthropy, he trades in his riches for a pair of magical, seven\u2010league boots, with which he travels the world in search of peace before finally finding solace in the study of earth sciences.<\/p>\n<p>The first part of the seminar unpacks the legacy of the shadowless man in the context of Berlin as a hub for multiple Technospheres. Schlemihl\u2019s (i.e. Chamisso\u2019s) scientific ambitions can be traced in the Berlin Digital Environmental Atlas, a comprehensive dataset documenting almost every possible aspect of the city\u2019s natural and built environment, from breeding bird populations and rare flowers, to carbon dioxide emissions, population density, and environmental justice. This wealth of knowledge stands in sharp contrast to the complicity of a political elite who have sold the city\u2019s public lands to devilish investors in the face of climate change, demographic upheaval, and the wanderings of tens of thousands of displaced individuals who, like Chamisso\u2019s hero, possess nothing more than their shadows, but bring new forms of knowledge to an already complex repository.<\/p>\n<p>The second part will embark on a collective field exercise through the Westhafen area of Berlin-Moabit to explore the potential dialogue\u2014or divergence\u2014between quantitative data, personal narrative, and changing imagery. Using methods of participatory observation, a form of anthropological \u201cshadowing,\u201d ecological site surveys, creative cartography, artistic invention, and radical story-telling participants track down evidence of industrial infrastructures and biological niches, local perceptions and everyday visions, and the paths and patterns of resources being shipped, stored, sold, or wasted. Literary moments from the Schlemihl story and key concepts of Romanticism, such as mystery, spontaneity, horror, and the sublime (concepts that appeared as revolutionary counterpoints to the scientific rationalization of nature in the nineteenth century), are applied to the overly quantified contemporary city. Amidst a sea of data, new romantic protagonists develop alternative narratives of the city.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Romancing the
