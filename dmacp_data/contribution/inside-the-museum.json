It is a time in which humans intervene in nature, and thus change and shape it. A world has developed in which humans and their needs play a dominant role in the ecological system. Agriculture, trade, transportation, and industry: as long as humans have existed we have been utilizing and altering our environment. Industrialization, in particular, has contributed to the unmistakable and often irreversible fingerprint that we are making upon the Earth. Today, the human imprint is so deep and pervasive that scientists, policymakers, and society are considering whether human-caused changes are affecting the geological record over the long term\u2014and there is talk that a new geological era has arrived. Welcome to the Anthropocene!<\/p>\n<p>This thesis was first introduced fifteen years ago and has been the topic of much debate since then. At first, the idea of an \u201cAge of Humans\u201d was only discussed among geologists, but now it has evolved into a multidisciplinary mental framework that links scientific and engineering theories and approaches to social and cultural scientific concepts. Humans in the Anthropocene not only intervene in nature as geological and biological actors, they also initiate mental processes in order to reinterpret the relationship between nature and culture, environment and society.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the Anthropocene is only a hypothesis and there is no consensus about its temporal scope or its scientific status. With its special exhibition on the Anthropocene, the Deutsches Museum is taking part in the global debate on this topic. In cooperation with the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society, the Deutsches Museum is the first such institution to present the Anthropocene in a large-scale exhibition. In doing so, the two Munich institutions have created a space for reflection, interpretation, and discussion\u2014and for further research on human\u2013nature interrelations.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>Covering 1,450 square meters, the gallery inspires visitors to ponder various questions. How could humans gain such an enormous influence on the ecological system? What is typical in the world of the Anthropocene? What will we eat? What will our cities look like? Will machines take control of our world, which is already highly automatized and regulated by algorithms? Through selected topics such as urbanization and mobility as well as evolution and food, the exhibition explores the past, present, and future of humanity. Historical artifacts trace the technology that put us on the path to the Anthropocene, while current research presents the challenges we are facing today, as well as possible solutions. Artistic interpretations provide visions for the future and ask us to look at the world in new ways.<\/p>\n<p>At the entrance, a supersized media cube familiarizes visitors with the Anthropocene by showing short video clips and an additional movie on this topic. The object shelf, which embraces the whole exhibition room and resembles a huge notebook or diary, presents real objects that trace the increasing influence of humans on the natural world, from industrialization to the present.<\/p>\n<p>Six large thematic \u201cislands\u201d address the following topics in detail: urbanization, mobility, humans and machines, nature, food, and evolution. They highlight the Anthropocene\u2019s effects and interactions on a global, biological, and social level. Carefully selected objects in combination with the central installation of film and media stations illustrate the spatial and temporal dimensions of human-caused global change and the chances and challenges we face in the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n<p>The exhibition contains multiple participatory elements. In particular, it invites visitors to answer such pressing questions as: what will the Anthropocene look like in the future? What sort of future do you wish for? What dangers do you see, what motivations are there for change, what are you afraid of, and what are your hopes for the Anthropocene?<\/p>\n<p>Visitors can take a sheet of paper and write down their thoughts, wishes, fears, and suggestions. They fold the paper and place it on a vacant stem in the flower bed. The flowers planted by visitors during the course of the exhibition are being \u201charvested\u201d and presented online.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>The virtual exhibition, interviews, a virtual tour of the exhibition, and further information on the exhibit can be found directly on the webpage of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.deutsches-museum.de\/en\/exhibitions\/special-exhibitions\/archive\/2015\/anthropocene\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deutsches Museum<\/a>.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3100,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:17","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:17","post_content":"","post_title":"Helmuth Trischler","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"helmuth-trischler","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 17:50:02","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 15:50:02","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/helmuth-trischler\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/helmuth-trischler\/","acf":{"first_name":"Helmuth","last_name":"Trischler"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20683,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:06:10","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:06:10","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grasping the Anthropocene demands a sense of deceleration\u2014we need \u201cslow media\u201d that by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The Imaginary Museum of Listening to the Anthropocene <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grasping the Anthropocene demands a sense of deceleration\u2014we need \u201cslow media\u201d that by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects. One such way is to focus on the development of an imaginary museum, whose galleries open up vistas for everyone seeking alternate ways to educate students and think about global change.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, global knowledge is often packaged for the \u201cfast and furious\u201d commercial media, or challenged by the democratic social media, but this module focuses on a \u201cthird way\u201d: \u201cslow media\u201d that, by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects. The idea of the Anthropocene demands thinking about a Long Now\u2014that is, not just a single human lifetime but up to seven generations, as suggested by <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/longnow.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Long Now Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To this we added the global imaginary, the Big Here: the local is now planetary in scale. An Anthropocene imaginary demands a sense of global citizenship and a consciousness on the part of an observer that includes their great-grandparents and their great-children. Having a \u201cglobal soul\u201d (to use Pico Iyer\u2019s term) and dwelling across generations stretches and stresses the human sense of self. The idea of doing such imagining at a slower pace in a physical place or with real objects, offers an alternative to the \u201csound bite\u201d approach to communicating complex ideas. One way to make the idea of slowing down concrete and accessible is through extending our understanding of the museum as a place that exhibits and preserves objects and artifacts. With the idea of an imaginary museum that holds individual objects and collections the seminar wants to offer new tools not only for people working in museums, but for everyone seeking alternative ways to educate students and citizens to think about global change and ways of living in the Anthropocene.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Slow
