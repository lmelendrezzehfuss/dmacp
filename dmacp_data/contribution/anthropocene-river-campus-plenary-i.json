In a seminar that confronts the difficulties of being out of energy and out of ideas, participants will negotiate the many limits the Anthropocene confronts us with and how this has a severe effect on how we understand and exist within it. The way that this exhaustion can also mark the cessation of practices and approaches that are no longer fit for purpose will also be explored.<\/p>\n <p>A foundational issue in studying the effects of climate change is the possibility of exhaustion; of resources, of ways of life, of species, the oxygen starved \u201cdead\u201d hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet the exhaustion can also indicate the end point of some practices that have become less useful\u2014or even ways of life that were not so compelling in the first place. It could also account for the effective exhaustion of communities or activist groups trying to battle global issues and sustain ways of living in an increasingly vulnerable state. By visiting multiple sites downriver from Tulane University, this seminar will explore the roles of exhaustion and imagination as pertaining to ongoing ecological, cultural, and historical figurations in the area. Exhaustion and imagination will be viewed as concurrent themes that inform each other by decoding the many layers of anthropogenic behaviors expressed upon and within the landscape.<\/p>\n<p>One site that will be focused on during the seminar is a disappearing parcel of land in Plaquemines Parish, outside the federal levee protection system and south of the soon to be constructed Breton Sound sediment diversion. It is heritage of a legacy of generations connected to this river land, descendants of an ethnic European man and an enslaved woman. Those involved with the seminar will take on differing perspectives concerning this parcel of land and how its geomorphological transformations play into the themes of the seminar while also discussing philosophies of ownership and its relation to place. Other sites of exploration will include geological remnants of deltaic lobe building and sites that reveal current practices surrounding river constriction and diversion measures in the parishes of Orleans and Saint Bernard.<\/p>\n<p>Seminar participants will be in-situ to observe, sense, listen, and interact with a complex accumulation of anthropogenic layers at multiple scales throughout time. These sites will serve as test cases to understand local permutations of macro issues pertaining to planetary changes, commodity chains, infrastructural and ecological metabolism, and the duration and temporality of these systems, with a particular focus on the exhaustion of land, water, and the body.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Exhaustion and

sediment into close contact with the human sciences, the arts, and Pierre Part, a community who live according to the movements of the River.<\/p>\n  <p>Among the myriad temporalities that weave in and out of each other along the Mississippi River, how can we understand time and register it? In attending to time, layers, and sediment, this seminar brings geology and conceptualizations of different timescales into close contact with the human sciences, the arts, and Pierre Part, a community who live according to the movements of the River.<\/p>\n <p>This seminar focuses on the concepts of layers and time. Sedimentary layers, layers of human experience, and the layers of industrialization in Louisiana\u2019s Mississippi \u201cchemical corridor.\u201d It will also explore many timescales at play in the river\u2019s sphere, from the long and astronomic to those of the river\u2019s evolution, to human history, and the lifespans of organisms. Cycles of human cultural or industrial processes often fail to synchronize with the layers and rhythmic cycles of many other biological, geological, and ecological processes, including the temporality of the flow of the river itself. Mis-matching rhythms of human practices also cause political tension and conflict over ways of life. The concept of the Anthropocene provides a space to think about these clashes of temporalities more explicitly. Through these tensions, we can begin to unpack how human and nonhuman temporalities affect each other and disentangle the cascading effects of unsynchronized cycles or accelerating processes. It will also investigate the different sedimentary layers along the river\u2019s path. Rachel Carson described the sediment record as \u201ca sort of epic poem of the Earth\u201d\u2014in arguably the first century of the Anthropocene, this layered waterborne matter also offers direct evidence of human impacts. Thus, the core objective of this seminar is to understand the Mississippi as a central actor in this anthro-geoscientific saga. The post-war period has been marked by \u201cnovel sediments,\u201d one of the most pervasive of which is plastic, the distribution and layering of which provides a potential marker of anthropogenic influence. Along the Mississippi plenty of plastic is produced by the region\u2019s petrochemical giants. But sediment is not just degraded and lost; the Wax Lake Outlet to the south of Pierre Part is growing as sediment accumulates and forms a new delta. Better understood, the management of sediment can provide a means to work against land loss and sea level rise along the Gulf coast.<\/p>\n<p>Multiple sensory pathways\u2014visual, auditory, tactile\u2014will navigate these different timescales and layers. The seminar will begin with a journey to the township of Pierre Part in Assumption Parish. Pierre Part residents live near the path of one of the river\u2019s main release valves, the Morganza Spillway. When opened, it threatens the town with waterborne sediment. Guided by local experts Bruce Barnes and Amy Lesen, the seminar will meet citizens from Pierre Part and discuss the effects of River Basin movements on people\u2019s lives in the area. We will weave music and song into our experience throughout the day. Returning to NOLA along Highway 18 (the Old River Road) at the end of Day 1 will entail dialogue on concepts of time and recognize the visual evidence of industrial layers and human history, such as plantations and chemical plants. Amy and Bruce will narrate a history of environmental and cultural change as we re-approach the city. Traveling on Day 2 to Baton Rouge, participants will visit the Louisiana State University\u2019s Lower Mississippi River model, which will demonstrate the dynamic river system and sedimentation processes there. Participants will also have the opportunity to engage with a core sample taken from the False River Point bar, a bow shaped water body formed by upriver deposition, and to visit the False River site.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Clashing

the heart of environmental justice is the focus of this seminar, which explores the paired concepts of risk and equity through lived experiences.<\/p>\n  <p>Risk to life and wellbeing are emblematic of the Anthropocene yet many risks are not shared nor accounted for amid the slow disasters of faulty infrastructure and exclusionary spatial practices that leave marginalized people in harm\u2019s way. This seminar articulates how risk assessment and management are at the heart of environmental justice.<\/p>\n <p>The adverse risks to climate change and ecological degradation are never shared equally across the globe\u2014or even within a region. This seminar explores the paired concepts of risk and equity as expressed through the lived experiences of residents in the lower Mississippi River region, and the infrastructures of greater New Orleans. It brings the notions of the \u201cQuotidian Anthropocene\u201d and \u201cSlow Disaster\u201d to bear, thinking about industrialization and toxicity not merely as quantifiable events on a timeline, but as exceedingly slow processes of environmental and human stress, locating the effects in the everyday lives and coping strategies of communities that persist and resist. Participants will work with conveners to gain background knowledge about these ideas, and then apply the concepts to field experiences in conjunction with community partners. The conceptual application is only made viable through a commitment to the mutuality of partnership with community members and locally active health and land use experts. We will explore the scale and scope of (anti-)Anthropocene activism and the diverse ways of reacting to risk\/equity issues in Louisiana.<\/p>\n<p>Special care is taken to emphasize that participants will be working within pre-existing channels of mutuality and collaboration, focused on the work of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN) and the Louisiana Landmarks Society (LLS), among others. Rather than foster \u201ctoxic tourism,\u201d participants will deepen their facility with the Quotidian Anthropocene and Slow Disaster through the development of methods of local action\u2014working on a project that was launched in September through the activities of the New Orleans Anthropocene Field Campus. At this time, the project format is open-ended, but will revolve around the formation of a community archive and it is expected that participants may wish to remain active and engaged in the localized work and partnerships after the Campus ends. Two advance call-in seminars will introduce participants to the concepts and the partnered project before the November Campus convenes. In Louisiana, participants will engage in on-site work sessions with LEAN and LLS as well as \u201con-campus\u201d debrief and discussion sessions.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar:
