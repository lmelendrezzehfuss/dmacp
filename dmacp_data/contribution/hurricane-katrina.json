The process of selective framing is shaped by the politics of knowledge and the hierarchies that inform the constitution of expertise. It affects how issues are understood and acted upon.

The seminar explored how the Anthropocene concept applies to both the small-scale and the large\u2014from the local and the regional to the national and global. It analyzed how class, race, nationality, and gender affect the relative positions assigned to social groups within the Anthropocene frame. The ultimate aim was to equip participants with the tools to think carefully and critically about the concepts and methods of analysis that they deploy.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Filtering the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-filtering-the-anthropocene","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-03 17:46:39","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-03 15:46:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20649","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-filtering-the-anthropocene\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":20650,"id":20650,"title":"Benedikt Rugar_Filtering the Anthropocene","filename":"HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene.jpg","filesize":2024147,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-filtering-the-anthropocene\/hkw_filtering-the-anthropocene\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_filtering-the-anthropocene","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20649,"date":"2020-02-27 14:31:10","modified":"2020-02-27 14:36:38","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":7679,"height":4778,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-768x478.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":478,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-300x187.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":187,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-768x478.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":478,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-1400x871.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":871,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":956,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1274,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/HKW_Filtering-the-Anthropocene-1600x996.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":996}},"teaser_text":"<p class=\"text\">The Anthropocene lens acts as a \u201cfilter\u201d: it emphasizes some elements of the socio-ecological spectrum even as it screens out certain others.
