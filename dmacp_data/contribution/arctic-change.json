North Pole is a mark on a map. Its inscribed existence represents no ownership. Yet, this spot in the North is a powerful tool in politics, economy, scientific exploration, and the war of the Anthropocene. In the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the North Pole and the surrounding Arctic ice are excluded from any national 200 nautical mile zone, known as an EEZ\u2014exclusive economic zone. With climate change and the melting of Arctic ice, that status is questioned by five states with sea borders in the Arctic: Canada, Denmark (with Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Russia, Norway, and the United States (with Alaska). Each shifts its Arctic borders through remapping the continental shelf of the Arctic in order to expand territorial claims. The economic lures of new sea passages, as well as oil and gas resources, tempted the Kingdom of Denmark to go so far as to include the cartographic North Pole in its claim in December 2014 before the United Nations, with arguments based on histories of the past and visions of a sustainable North for human and nonhuman agencies.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs et al., <em>Kingdom of Denmark: Strategy for the Arctic 2011\u20132020<\/em>.
