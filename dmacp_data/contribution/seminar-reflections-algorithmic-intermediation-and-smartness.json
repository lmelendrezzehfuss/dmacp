Instructors suggested that the groups should \u201cBe Evil!\u201d (a play on Google\u2019s motto \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d), meaning that groups should seriously consider the deleterious consequences that would follow from introducing smartness ubiquitously, and should not shy away from the potentially inhuman results. Another instructor explained this imperative by suggesting that rather than circumventing the deleterious consequences of a smart world, imaginary disaster apps should attempt to \u201cgo through\u201d the world of smartness and come out the other side. Teams were encouraged to draw broadly on the diverse expertise of group members to produce the most imaginative and evocative applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From among the results of these projects, a selection of three are presented here. The report on \u201cKAIROS Earthquake Early Warning Application\u201d by Svenja Sch\u00fcffler is a literary and technical investigation of the potential to design automated smart systems to detect earthquakes and warn the citizenry in advance of disasters. Equipped with \u201cinnumerable sensory devices and objects found underground and on the surface [\u2026] MEMS accelerometers, cameras, RFIDs, and GPS,\u201d the proposed &#8220;KAIROS&#8221; system imagines the introduction of smart sensing technology into future megacities to forestall environmental catastrophes before they arrive. By contrast, \u201cCANARY TM\u201d imagines the installation of singing, canary-like voices throughout a city whose purpose would be reminiscent of the \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d whose death signalled a threat to human miners. &#8220;CANARY TM&#8221; imagines the introduction of such canaries on a (mega)citywide scale, based on equipping cities with speakers whose melodic chirping apprises residents of the environmental safety of the city. Finally, \u201cI prefer not to\u201d offers a critical and performative record of refusal to accept the parameters of the intermediated smart world. Comprising the stark, rudimentary documents of the responses made by the class to a group that refused to accept the parameters of the assignment, it queries how humans respond to the radical withdrawal of the technological and technocratic imperatives of the intermediated world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each of these projects (as well as other projects not included here as they remain in draft form) join philosophical and practical elements together. On the one hand, these disaster apps aim at imagining the kind of needs and challenges that might confront the technosphere in which we are destined to live. Following the principles of the \u201csmart mandate\u201d outlined by the instructors, these apps endeavour to understand how the future management of life might proceed in circumstances where the prospect of environmental destruction overshadows all of living experience. However, there is also an existential aspect to these apps\u2014an exploration of the mentalities and sensibilities that would pervade such a world, and where the human being locates itself in the technospheric landscape. Thus, each of these apps also grapples with ethical, affective, and aesthetic features of a future smart world. By employing exposition, visuals, multimedia, and audio, these apps imagine responses that go beyond technicity and automatisms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four proposed projects for continued development also spring from the seminar. Olivier Hamant has launched a project on the study of \u201csuboptimalism,\u201d informed by the contributions of members from the seminar. An early manifesto from that project will be delivered to the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) by Dr. Hamant. In addition, Juan Suarez of the Red Cross developed an idea for an app that would \u201cgamify\u201d the prediction and warning of flood systems. Efforts are being made to explore possible applications of this work. Finally, the \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d group is preparing an artwork and performance that more fully investigates the themes outlined above. Another participant in the seminar has approached members of the HKW to discuss the prospect of implementing an automated analysis of the audio recordings from the seminar, with the goal of producing a glossary for better understanding its key concepts. This proposal is under consideration by the HKW.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By way of reflection, participants in the seminar identified a number of areas and questions that might be helpful to direct future efforts, in order to develop these ideas in greater detail. One member of the discussion remarked that, in the case of some projects\u2014for example, the \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d\u2014there were challenges in understanding how artistic intervention concretely engages the technological problems of the seminar. Future seminars of this sort would benefit from a more sustained engagement with the bridge between aesthetic and technical investigation, as well as reflection on what group members owe to the seminar in terms of making constructive contributions that are intelligible to a wide range of participants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another question raised by seminar participants was how best to integrate the different types of knowledge brought to the seminar by the instructors. On the one hand, there was the concept of intermediation animating much of the course, and, in many respects, this concept borrowed from biology and related fields to discuss how it is that complexity and other problems in the technosphere may be managed. On the other hand, the concept of smartness, which was defined more in alignment with ideas drawn from design, critical theory, and their related fields. The different slants to these concepts reflects the different backgrounds of the instructors. Implicitly, this animated much of the work and discussion. Whether these ideas are best kept in tension, or whether it would have been better to have them fully integrated in advance, remains an open question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some seminar participants saw in the \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d intervention an allegory of the violence of data that reflects on the style of the campus. A number of participants did not realize that they were being recorded at all times before this intervention made clear the technospheric operations of the seminar space. A number of participants expressed unease with the fact that many of their ideas could not be expressed completely freely when they were being recorded. In future seminars, some of the participants would prefer a format that does not record conversations, in order to encourage a freer, less self-conscious dialogue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":2990,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:07","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21

With the advent of the Internet, new intermediation services have emerged, such as search engines and social networks. Intermediation is ensured by algorithms, which \u201cdecide\u201d what is relevant for people. Even as algorithms aim to satisfy users, they also optimize for other parameters, such as establishing a uniform balance between supply and demand. Intermediation also enables the sharing of resources, crowdsourcing, and crowdfunding by making people aware of potential consumers or producers of services. To explore the contemporary architecture of algorithmic intermediation, we focus on \u201csmartness,\u201d which has risen to prominence as a catchall term legitimating sensor and \u201cbig data\u201d analytics to facilitate the algorithmic intermediation among humans, technologies, and the environment. \u201cSmartness\u201d has come to take on a morally virtuous connotation as a purportedly necessary, even mandatory, set of practices by which to sustain or preserve human life in the face of environmental security, and financial insecurities. Much of this discourse is driven by corporations, as evidenced by the popularity of company tags such as IBM\u2019s recent corporate slogans (\u201cThink Smart\u201d; \u201cSmarter Planet\u201d), and products such as the \u201csmart phone\u201d and the \u201csmart home,\u201d and \u201csmart cities,\u201d all of which aim to integrate environmentally responsible practices, optimize consumer behavior, and operate as technologies of cybernetic governance.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Algorithmic Intermediation and Smartness","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-algorithmic-intermediation-and-smartness","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-27 15:53:27","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-27 14:53:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9144,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=18577","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2016\/seminar-algorithmic-intermediation-and-smartness\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":18578,"id":18578,"title":"seminar_07_vis_up01","filename":"seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","filesize":64530,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2016\/seminar-algorithmic-intermediation-and-smartness\/seminar_07_vis_up01\/","alt":"","author":"11","description":"","caption":"","name":"seminar_07_vis_up01","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":18577,"date":"2020-02-10 10:12:58","modified":"2020-02-10 10:52:40","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1140,"height":641,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01-768x432.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":432,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01-300x169.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":169,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01-768x432.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":432,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","large-width":1140,"large-height":641,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","1536x1536-width":1140,"1536x1536-height":641,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","2048x2048-width":1140,"2048x2048-height":641,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","feature-width":1140,"feature-height":641}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What forms of futurity, speculation, and life do algorithmic intermediations produce?
