Here, if you are fortunate, you might see the remains of a long-forgotten lock and dam. I say \u201cfortunate\u201d because the dam is a ghostly presence. Completed in 1907, abandoned and largely destroyed in 1912, its remains lurk just beneath the surface. When water levels fall, often toward the end of summer, it seems to rise from the river, an apparition that disappears just as silently as it arrived.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGhostly\u201d may be the wrong term. Or, if it is to be the right term, we will have to understand better what it is that returns. For ghosts return; they haunt. They must be attended to, be come to terms with. Which is to say that the Meeker Dam, as it is commonly known, is not just a ruin that occasionally presents itself to those who walk along the river\u2019s shore or to those who descend the recently restored wagon road from St. Paul, restored not long after the dam was placed on the National Registry of Historical Places in 2003. Nor is it merely a quaint reminder of the engineering feats of settlers or a charming remnant from past struggles between Minneapolis and St. Paul\u2014mediated far away in Washington D.C.\u2014over which city could rightly claim to be the head of navigation on the river.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Bradley B. Meeker was a settler, property owner, and judge who served on the Minnesota Territorial Supreme Court from 1849 to \u201953. Eager to establish Minneapolis as the head of navigation on the Mississippi River and capture the site\u2019s potential hydropower, Meeker and a number of Minneapolis businessmen proposed building the dam at a site owned by Meeker. Accounts of the Meeker Dam can be found in John Anfinson, \u201cThe Secret History of the Mississippi\u2019s Earliest Locks and Dams,\u201d <em>Minnesota History<\/em>, vol. 54, no. 6 (1998): pp. 254\u201367.

For the Meeker Dam represents a settler vision and a settler spatiotemporality: the river imagined and remade as infrastructure on which the development of a settler society and the fortunes of an emerging industrial capitalism would rest. This is a vision that turns the river into a problem of engineering, fluid-mechanics, geology, and hydrology. It makes of it a puzzle to be solved: how to channel water, hold it back, let it flow at the right times and through the right spaces; how to move boats up a river that is too shallow, its drop too steep; how to regulate flows so that commodities can be moved to markets, investments realized, speculations in land made profitable. The river was remade within a spatiotemporal imagination that linked northern forests and farmer fields to distant markets that no logger or farmer had ever seen.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, if the remains of the Meeker Dam haunt us, it is perhaps for other reasons.

The Meeker Dam haunts us for what it embodies. Not just as the projection of an infrastructural vision, but the projection of such a vision when other territorialities, temporalities, and ontologies\u2014Dakota, Ho-Chunk, and Anishinaabe\u2014were present all around. Rising from its watery grave, the Meeker Dam forces us to ask what made it possible to imagine the river then as an industrial river, part of an emerging industrial capitalism that had only recently taken hold further to the east? What erasures were necessary, what ontologies, territorialities, and temporalities had to be willfully ignored, for the river to become the \u201cnation\u2019s river,\u201d subsumed within the taken-for-granted temporalities of a settler nation and its political and legal institutions? How was a settler futurity set in place and Indigenous futures rendered unimaginable?

The dam was abandoned in 1912 because a much larger dam\u2014what is now known as Lock and Dam No. 1\u2014was built a few miles downstream, large enough to allow for navigation upriver to just below St. Anthony Falls, and with sufficient head to generate energy for the Ford Motors assembly plant that relocated there in 1925. In the following decades, almost 30 locks and dams would be built on the Upper Mississippi. Together with levees and dredging to control floods and enable larger barges, they produced an engineered river linked to industry and agriculture from Minneapolis all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, one which conformed to a geopolitical imagination that had no place for, or even consideration of, other temporalities and territorialities, other relations to water and land that did not follow the logic of settler law and property.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Audra Simpson notes that settler colonialism proceeds without regard for \u201cother life forms, other sovereignties, other forms of political will.\u201d Audra Simpson, \u201cThe State is a Man: Theresa Spence, Loretta Saunders and the Gender of Settler Sovereignty,\u201d <em>Theory &amp; Event<\/em>, vol. 19, no. 4 (2016), para. 17: <a href=\"https:\/\/muse-jhu-edu.ezp2.lib.umn.edu\/article\/633280\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/muse-jhu-edu.ezp2.lib.umn.edu\/article\/633280<\/a> <\/span><\/span><\/span> Today, managed as an integrated system, the locks and dams capture and channel the energy of water toward particular ends rather than others, creating new social and ecological relations, subtending settler society and its industrial ecologies, and, in their day-to-day operations, obscuring and continuing the work of dispossession, oblivious to those or that which have been displaced. Indeed, what remains of the Meeker Dam is less the physical ruins of the dam itself than a political, economic, and ecological rationality that presupposes nation and state, one that imagines capitalist markets to be as natural as rivers, and one that projects and assumes a settler future <em>as a matter of course<\/em>, much as Meeker and his associates already did 167 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>The story of the Meeker Dam is thus not just about a dam and a river, but a world created around it, a bustling city built on the fruits of primitive accumulation and the depletion and degradation of northern forests, soils, and water. As residents of the Twin Cities, we inherit this river and its worlds, albeit in radically different and unequal ways. During periods of low water, when the Meeker Dam appears to rise from its watery grave, it reminds us that the urban worlds we take for granted are built upon and carry forward these settler temporalities, spatialities, and ecologies.<\/p>\n<p>But what does it mean to say that we inherit the Meeker Dam, when this \u201cwe\u201d is defined by the benefits derived from Indigenous dispossession? What responsibilities does this demand? We might begin by noting that benefits are derived unevenly, that in the context of forced migration, immigrant exclusion, relocation, and chattel slavery, not all non-Indigenous residents are settlers in the same way.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">See Iyko Day, \u201cBeing or Nothingness: Indigeneity, Antiblackness, and Settler Colonial Critique,\u201d <em>Critical Ethnic Studies<\/em>, vol. 1, no. 2 (2015): pp. 102\u201321.<\/span><\/span><\/span> We might continue, as Potawatomi scholar Kyle Whyte proposes, by refusing to deny that as settlers, we live in what our ancestors could have only seen as fantasy times.

Dakota resistance had not ended and would only become more vigorous. Settler law and property were far from settled, and the river did not bend easily to the desires of investors and engineers. When construction of Meeker\u2019s dam was finally begun, long after Meeker himself was dead, engineers struggled to control the force of the river, resulting in cycles of destruction, redesign, and repair. Whyte asks us to see our present as continuous with this past, indeed, founded on it. Borrowing his language, we might say that infrastructures built in the past \u201cwere constructed to provide privileges to the builder\u2019s descendants.

If the Meeker Dam haunts, it is not only because it reminds us about a past where the future was not assured, but because when it rises from its watery grave, it brings that past into the present, it reminds us that if we look beneath the surface and allow ourselves to see what remains, we see that we are still fully <em>within <\/em>this history as an ongoing process.
