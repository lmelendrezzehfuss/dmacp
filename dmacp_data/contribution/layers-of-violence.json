Inspired by the revolution in Haiti, which overthrew the slave power in 1804, almost 500 slaves participated, before being met and defeated by federal forces and local militia two days later, near present-day Kenner, Louisiana. Over the course of the revolt, two white men were killed. After summary trials, ninety-five of the slaves faced execution and decapitation, their heads posted on pikes stretching along the path of the revolt. It was a disaster that overwhelmed the local population as surely as any hurricane or epidemic. But suppression of this history was crucial to slave owners, who were desperate to keep their captives illiterate, ill informed, and isolated. And so, the German Coast Uprising remained mostly a local story, fading into near legend. It has not been widely taught or studied, and barely exists in American history textbooks.<\/p>\n<p>In November 2019, the performance artist and activist Dread Scott led a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2019\/11\/09\/777810796\/hundreds-march-in-reenactment-of-a-historic-but-long-forgotten-slave-rebellion\">reenactment march<\/a> to commemorate the uprising, and to inspire awareness of the connection between that distant history and our own time.

But in an anthropocenic frame of mind, we need to take a much longer historical view, and we now see socioeconomic systems that were previously analyzed separately in the same frame: intensive, extractive plantation capitalism; unfree and unhealthy labor; structured violence and inequality\u2014from the slave system of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the Jim Crow system of racialized labor after 1865, to the industrial system of petrochemical production in the current era. The flow from system to system forms a remarkable anthropocenic continuity.<\/p>\n<p>Not only were South Louisiana slaveowners successful in their suppression of the German Coast Uprising and its history, but they thrived in the decades that followed. After the United States\u2019 participation in the international slave trade came to an end in 1808, Louisiana became the heart of the domestic slave trade in the Deep South. Investors and speculators streamed south, buying land to plant with cotton and sugarcane and slaves to work it. Propped up by a tariff on foreign sugar, Louisiana sugar planters expanded their holdings of land that hugged the river between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. They grew phenomenally wealthy off slave labor, building ever more opulent and fantastical plantation homes to showcase their success. These homes sat facing the levee one after another, each one with attendant, orderly rows of slave cabins crammed with dozens of enslaved workers.<\/p>\n<p>Louisiana\u2019s sugar plantations had some of the highest populations of enslaved people anywhere in the country. The stately homes, set off by lush gardens and stands of oak and pecan trees, obscured and softened the industrial-scale labor and violence in the fields and sugar factories.

As with many plantation museums, the slave owner\u2019s home is the prize of San Francisco Plantation. The big house, with its ornate facade painted in rich Caribbean blues and yellows, is prominently featured in regional promotional materials and advertisements. A visitor might be forgiven for being captivated by this spectacle of Antebellum architecture\u2014that was the very purpose of its construction, after all. But it\u2019s hard to see the complex truth with your gaze fixed, myopically, on the house. Widening the scope reveals the architectural context of this 1853 mansion. It is surrounded today on all sides by petrochemical tanks and machinery belonging to the Marathon Oil Company, which owns and operates the museum.

Strong economic and political forces are at work in the portrayal of a slave revolt or an oil spill as an aberrant event, unconnected from the normal flow of time, somehow separate and operating according to the logics of chance, or acts of God, or the madness of men. The idea of a \u201cslow disaster\u201d is a way to expose and explore these political investments in \u201cevent thinking,\u201d and an invitation to think about disasters not as atomized events but as long-term processes linked across time\u2014a crucial analytical act for the Anthropocene. Sometimes the linkages are documentable through the pages and photographs of a violent plantation era, sometimes they are buried more deeply in the land, the archaeological record, and at others aloft in the atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>The plantations needed river access to move their sugar cane to market\u2014a global market that was intensifying over the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries through industrial-scale plantation agriculture and the brutal \u201cmanagement\u201d of slave-labor forces. The plantations marked out long, skinny plots of land, with majestic houses usually fronting the river, today hidden behind the Mississippi River levee system. Docks and refining works stood along the river, slave houses stretched back into the cane fields, and swampy woods made up the rear. After the Civil War\u2014the moment of an expected liberation for the freed population of the German Coast\u2014the economy carried on largely unchanged, with sons and daughters of enslaved people, and grandsons and granddaughters, working the land. They were tied to this land by Jim Crow laws that prevented free movement and locked African Americans in debt, unrepresented and in constant fear of racial terrorism.<\/p>\n<p>In the early twentieth century, the land use began to change. Oil was discovered at Beaumont, Texas, in 1901, which was quickly followed by discoveries in Louisiana in 1906. Standard Oil bought a 300-acre cotton plantation outside Baton Rouge in 1909, establishing a precedent for dozens of companies. Chemical manufacturing to serve markets for fertilizers, pesticides, plastics, and the manifold additives for petroleum manufacture settled in to stay. The long, skinny plantation holdings were now assembled for industrial uses\u2014perfectly situated for the purposes of petrochemical manufacturing with their river access points, once again tying the land and the factories to a toxic global market. As international companies bought up Louisiana\u2019s sugar and cotton lands, refineries, tank farms, and pipelines began to share space with plantations, many of which did not cease operations until the late twentieth century. The intensification of petrochemical manufacturing along this stretch of river delta is heralded as one of the defining features of American economic development through and following the Second World War. Environmental impacts\u2014manifest in the air, the water, the senses of the residents and workers\u2014were ignored in the absence of any regulations or restraint.

Today, their descendants suffer a violence that is almost invisible. It is in the air they breathe, the water they drink\u2014their rates of COVID-19 infection are even higher than the American average\u2014and chronic health struggles predispose them to greater suffering today. Like their ancestors, their bodies suffer for the generation of someone else\u2019s wealth. The only industries that have ever existed on this land have been extractive.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3315,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:36","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:36","post_content":"","post_title":"Scott Gabriel Knowles","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"scott-gabriel-knowles","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-24 16:08:06","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-24 14:08:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/scott-gabriel-knowles\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/scott-gabriel-knowles\/","acf":{"first_name":"Scott Gabriel","last_name":"Knowles"}},{"ID":27411,"post_author":"12","post_date":"2020-07-24 15:37:30","post_date_gmt":"2020-07-24 13:37:30","post_content":"","post_title":"Ashley Rogers","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"ashley-rogers","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-08-03 10:55:33","post_modified_gmt":"2020-08-03 08:55:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=27411","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/ashley-rogers\/","acf":{"first_name":"Ashley","last_name":"Rogers"}}],"projects":[{"ID":3412,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-21 16:07:12","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 14:07:12","post_content":"<p>The articulation of risk assessment and management as being at the heart of environmental justice is the focus of this seminar, which explores the paired concepts of risk and equity through lived experiences.<\/p>\n  <p>Risk to life and wellbeing are emblematic of the Anthropocene yet many risks are not shared nor accounted for amid the slow disasters of faulty infrastructure and exclusionary spatial practices that leave marginalized people in harm\u2019s way. This seminar articulates how risk assessment and management are at the heart of environmental justice.<\/p>\n <p>The adverse risks to climate change and ecological degradation are never shared equally across the globe\u2014or even within a region. This seminar explores the paired concepts of risk and equity as expressed through the lived experiences of residents in the lower Mississippi River region, and the infrastructures of greater New Orleans. It brings the notions of the \u201cQuotidian Anthropocene\u201d and \u201cSlow Disaster\u201d to bear, thinking about industrialization and toxicity not merely as quantifiable events on a timeline, but as exceedingly slow processes of environmental and human stress, locating the effects in the everyday lives and coping strategies of communities that persist and resist. Participants will work with conveners to gain background knowledge about these ideas, and then apply the concepts to field experiences in conjunction with community partners. The conceptual application is only made viable through a commitment to the mutuality of partnership with community members and locally active health and land use experts. We will explore the scale and scope of (anti-)Anthropocene activism and the diverse ways of reacting to risk\/equity issues in Louisiana.<\/p>\n<p>Special care is taken to emphasize that participants will be working within pre-existing channels of mutuality and collaboration, focused on the work of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN) and the Louisiana Landmarks Society (LLS), among others. Rather than foster \u201ctoxic tourism,\u201d participants will deepen their facility with the Quotidian Anthropocene and Slow Disaster through the development of methods of local action\u2014working on a project that was launched in September through the activities of the New Orleans Anthropocene Field Campus. At this time, the project format is open-ended, but will revolve around the formation of a community archive and it is expected that participants may wish to remain active and engaged in the localized work and partnerships after the Campus ends. Two advance call-in seminars will introduce participants to the concepts and the partnered project before the November Campus convenes. In Louisiana, participants will engage in on-site work sessions with LEAN and LLS as well as \u201con-campus\u201d debrief and discussion sessions.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar:
