The history of urban housing and property insurance industries cannot be understood without accounting for the long histories of urban conflagrations in cities such as London or New York. Those cities were dense accumulations of wood, stone, fibers, and open flame that frequently burned and, because of this, gave rise to vast industries that broker futures with the material of cities. Thinking about how the future is political and material in this way has allowed us to understand more broadly how there is never just one future on the social scene but a dense ecology of them vying for attention, coming into being and passing away.<\/p>\n<p>But there is one thing that has been frequently overlooked in this work: the center of the earth. Those of us interested in the social and political function of the future can energize a discussion around cosmology and cosmogony.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<h2>Centering the Earth and the Earth\u2019s Center<\/h2>\n<p>On volcanoes, or coastlines disappearing under rising sea levels, and at the edge of earthquake cracks and the muddy grounds of landslides, there is obviously an intense relationship between the necessity of forecasting and the need to understand the earth itself. Pressing cosmological problems emerge around the makeup of the earth\u2014its interior, origins, contingency or lawfulness. It is pressing because there are social demands to know what the future holds and these require an engagement with the meaning and make-up of the earth. Nature forecasting at these sites of high levels of uncertainty is a way of doing cosmology because it demands an account of the structure and causes of how the earth works.<\/p>\n<p>But more than this, nature forecasting in these circumstances is also a way of building cosmologies into the world, making them material and giving them form. Cosmologies make worlds in their own image. They are not just interpretations of the world or ideas projected onto the world. The cosmology that states that mantle convection determines crustal movement, the shape of continents, earthquakes and volcanoes, is a product of modern earth sciences, and modern earth sciences are the product of the spaces made by global networks of instruments and laboratories. This is the modern cosmology of the earth, our myth of earth, that is enacted in space in these networks, laboratories and instruments. Forecasting earthquakes, eruptions, and tsunamis, then, becomes material performance of the cosmology of plate tectonics and a means of testing it in the world.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Deborah Coen,\u00a0<em>The Earthquake Observers: Disaster Science from Lisbon to Richter<\/em>\u00a0(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013).

Landscapes, then, are these built models made inhabitable and lived in.<\/p>\n<p>The reason that it is important for those of us interested in understanding forecasting to foreground cosmological and cosmogenic questions is because it allows us to dig deeper into the conditions that make particular futures possible and how the time of nature is lived socially. Modernist geology, as historians of geology tell the story, was born of a cosmology that struggled with its Judeo-Christian, monotheist inheritance, and produced not only the astonishing deep past but also the deep future\u2014an earth that will outlast human inhabitation and that was not made for us.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Martin Rudwick,\u00a0<em>World\u2019s Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform <\/em>(Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2008); Martin Rudwick,\u00a0<em>Earth\u2019s Deep History: How It Was Discovered and Why it Matters<\/em> (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2008).<\/span><\/span> This \u201cdisenchanted\u201d modernist future is inseparable from a conception of earth and planetary structure developed in the European and American high imperial and colonial periods and of which the Anthropocene designation is the most recent instance of this geological cosmology.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>By placing the future of the earth at the center of inquiry we can also begin to think about the stories that describe and explain how the earth operates\u2014its cosmology. This also means taking seriously the multiplicity of cosmologies that haven\u2019t been \u201cmodernized,\u201d or otherwise subverted, escaped, or hybridized with contested cosmologies. We can begin to understand how the earth\u2019s futures differ according to the cosmological understanding of what, how, and why it is made. This has consequences for the kinds of political futures we can imagine. We can imagine that multiple futures of the earth\u2014not only deep time\u2014have emerged, been tested, and put into circulation. And because of this, we can also begin to understand how those different futures have forged different kinds of politics and relationships between society and nature.<\/p>\n<p>The future of nature, then, is a cosmological question. Before making claims about what the future of nature will be, I suggest that we undertake the cosmological work on the make-up of earth itself, its origins, and how multiple cosmologies interact as ideas, architectures, and materials in space. This of course also means avoiding the tropes of modernist comparative cosmologies which often imagined that cosmological systems were stable, with defined edges, and without history. Instead, it is a problem of cosmologies in motion and encounter, of space and matter, folded and enfolding. They carve out and test futures of the earth, place the earth under our feet, make sense of its shuddering and displacement. They multiply the earth and its futures.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":26073,"post_author":"97","post_date":"2020-05-28 13:41:11","post_date_gmt":"2020-05-28 11:41:11","post_content":"","post_title":"Adam Bobbette","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"adam-bobbette","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-05-28 13:41:11","post_modified_gmt":"2020-05-28 11:41:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=26073","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"friederike.becker","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/adam-bobbette\/","acf":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Bobbette"}}],"projects":[{"ID":11633,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2018-11-07 15:45:31","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-07 14:45:31","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">How can the concept of \u201cthe Elemental\u201d inform the ways in which we speak about the Anthropocene?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n  <p>The theme of \u201cthe Elemental\u201d served as the organizing scheme of the <em>Anthropocene Campus Melbourne<\/em> and operated as a reference point for the articulation of genuinely anthropocenic questions and research paths.
