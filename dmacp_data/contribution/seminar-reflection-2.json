In the first round, the subject was numbers, in the second academic disciplines, and the third subject was stakeholders or other potential knowledge-bearers. If a matching number, discipline, or stakeholder was called out, the colleague who called out \u201cSnap\u201d first was the winner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discipline Slam: <\/strong>Each participant was given one minute to describe the academic discipline(s), profession, or knowledge community to which they felt they belonged, and to indicate its relevance to the Anthropocene. Even though participants had been trained in different disciplinary realms, many shared similar research questions, methods, and preferred readings. Some observed, in fact, that there seemed to be more in common between Campus participants than those of many other, more discipline-focused conferences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Introductory Lecture I: <\/strong>Bronislaw Szerszynski\u2019s introductory lecture put forward the possible dimensions of interdisciplinarity, which is formed from different degrees of interdisciplinary integration across and beyond disciplines, various practices of interdisciplinarity as well as the various different goals and motivations of interdisciplinarity. The strength of interdisciplinarity lies in the fact it can be creatively agonistic between forms of knowledge and thereby serve to disrupt ontological objects of knowledge. Szerszynski suggested that it was necessary to distinguish between forms of knowledge, explicit or tacit, individual or collective, and that this division formed the basis for Alice Lam\u2019s typology of embrained, encoded, embodied, and embedded knowledge. The processes of knowledge transformation were considered through the work of Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi: the externalization that turns tacit into explicit knowledge; the combination of forms of explicit knowledge; the internalization involved in learning through doing, thus giving explicit knowledge a tacit dimension; the socialization of individually-held tacit knowledge through field-building.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Introductory lecture II: <\/strong>Mark Lawrence\u2019s lecture looked at interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity with reference to climate geoengineering. In the context of anthropogenic climate change and historical attempts at controlling the weather, various techniques have been proposed, including removal of carbon dioxide on land and at sea, and planetary albedo modification. Toward this aim, different academic disciplines have been involved in climate geoengineering research (from the physical sciences and engineering, to political science and philosophy) and, in addition, wider societal issues, such as governance and ethics, have come to the fore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Experiential learning game \u2013 Performing Burning Issues<\/strong>:<br \/>\nIn the first round of the Learning Game, one person\u2019s opening statement was followed by someone else\u2019s response that began \u201cNo! But \u2026\u201d before their own opinions and ideas as alternatives were offered. In the second round, the same format was used, but now the responder began \u201cYes! And \u2026\u201d before they presented their own ideas, complementary to the other person\u2019s statement. In the third round, each participant again began \u201cYes! And \u2026\u201d although now a physical response was required. Now the responder had to act out his or her idea by striking a frozen pose, which was meant to connect in some way to the poses struck by earlier participants, resulting in a collective human-concept \u201csculpture.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Group Work<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compassion and connectedness \u2013 on how to connect to the fate of individuals;<\/li>\n<li>Practices of the self \u2013 Molly \u2013 about a molecule and its journey;<\/li>\n<li>Creative experiments \u2013 developing an archive and web platform that allows users to navigate through diverse narratives of matter;<\/li>\n<li>Sharing \u2013 focusing on Haiti\u2019s journey from independent utopia to dystopia; \u2022 Radical education reform \u2013 looking at the school as a microcosm of the planet;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Wrapping it All Up<\/strong>: Participants questioned the dominance of the interdisciplinarity approach, which is seen as a precondition to better problem solving (the logic of integration). Delegates reflected on how to situate knowledge if the Anthropocene is approached as an entanglement that we are in, rather than as a problem to solve. Perhaps what the Anthropocene does is force us to recognize that disciplinary knowledge is less about the world than in the world; that it participates in the world\u2019s becoming. Hence, working across disciplines can be a means by which to achieve greater knowledge, especially if it helps to cultivate friction between disciplines rather than to integrate them. In this way, disciplinarities promote comparing incommensurable things, so that categories are questioned, rather than simply compiled as data. One approach that made use of creative experiments as radically interdisciplinary modes of research is described in the essay &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/feeling-following-creative-experiments-and-material-play\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feeling\/Following<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":false,"projects":[{"ID":20699,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:29:33","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:29:33","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The blurring of distinctions between Earth processes and human history requires us to be \u201ctransdisciplinary\u201d and sometimes even \u201cundisciplinary\u201d \u2013 in order to combine the knowledge base and research capacities of a wide variety of stakeholders.<\/span><\/p>\n  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The blurring of distinctions between Earth processes and human history requires us to be \u201ctransdisciplinary\u201d and sometimes even \u201cundisciplinary\u201d \u2013 to learn how to go beyond traditional disciplinary forms of knowledge production in order to combine the knowledge base and research capacities of a wide variety of stakeholders.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene incites us to learn new habits and practices of knowledge production.

But it also requires us to be reflexive \u2013 to be aware of the way that all forms of knowledge production are shaped by historical and social context, by instrumentation and by social practices, and can thereby make certain things visible while hiding others. The idea of the seminar was to explore these issues through diverse kinds of collaborative activity. We looked at the range of existing knowledge-skills and their relevance for the Anthropocene. What does it mean to \u201cknow\u201d something, individually or collectively? In which ways does \u201cknowing in the Anthropocene\u201d centrally involve issues of non-knowledge in all its diverse forms, including \u201cknown unknowns\u201d and the
