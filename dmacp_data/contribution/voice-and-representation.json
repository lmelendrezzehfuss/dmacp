In this seminar the various applications, valuations, privileges and risks accompanying recent Anthropocene scholarship come under close scrutiny through a focus on keywords.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of keywords, following on Raymond Williams\u2019 work and subsequent projects such as Keywords for Radicals (Fritsch, O\u2019Connor and Thompson) is that word usage may tune us into prevailing social priorities as well as what is elided in such framings. Considering the keywords that we choose to examine as scholars, or those we try to dismiss, also encourages reflection on our own work as academics, artists and other communicators\/meaning-makers. We think our collective assemblage of keywords may help structure our critical discussion on the topic of this seminar within the context of the Anthropocene Campus Philadelphia.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":false,"projects":[{"ID":4982,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2017-10-22 15:00:30","post_date_gmt":"2017-10-22 13:00:30","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">A collaborative campus hosted by Drexel University, Philadelphia, from Oct 22\u201226, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n  <p>The <em>Anthropocene Campus Philadelphia<\/em> (ACP) was a collaborative campus event that took place at Drexel University in October 2017 to challenge the familiar boundaries between the environmental studies disciplines and to open the way for what we believe is a sustainable and provocative research enterprise. The ACP-developed inquiry into Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley engaged with questions of importance to multiple sectors and resonated with other cases in a transnational framework. We construed our approach broadly to include intersecting disciplines, a wide range of actors and experts, and historical time scales from the deep past into the future. In addition to four primary seminars, the ACP also featured plenary lectures, short workshops, a film series, performances, and a full day set aside for field visits (from historical archives and empty buildings to brownfield sites and barges) in the region.<\/p>\n <h1>About<\/h1>\n<p>The <em>Anthropocene Campus Philadelphia<\/em> (ACP) builds on the Anthropocene Campus events hosted in Berlin by the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in 2014 and 2016. Both of these transformative events challenged familiar boundaries between the environmental studies disciplines, opening the way for what we believe is a sustainable and provocative research enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>The ACP breaks some new ground in that its geographical gaze is focused squarely on one region: Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley. From the complex industrial, economic, and environmental history of this region, the ACP develops an inquiry that engages with questions of importance to multiple sectors, and which resonates with other cases in a transnational framework.
