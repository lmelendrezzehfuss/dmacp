Their leader, Black Hawk, had already tried to surrender several times during the so-called war that bears his name, and the massacre began even after he once again waved a flag of truce. When soldiers began firing, Black Hawk\u2019s band had little choice but to provide cover for those trying to cross. Soldiers on the bluffs streamed down to shoot at closer range, while a military riverboat fired on retreating families with cannons. Although some made it to safety, many of those who crossed the river were soon captured by the US-allied Dakota. Militiamen gleefully mutilated corpses; sharpshooters deliberately targeted babies. When reproached for these actions, one volunteer soldier coldly replied, \u201cKill the nits, and you\u2019ll have no lice.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">William Henry Perrin, <em>History of Crawford and Clark Counties, Illinois<\/em>.

Of course, some Ho-Chunk refused to be removed, and remained in or returned to each of these places.<\/p>\n<p>The Bad Axe Massacre has a prehistory, a context. A land cession treaty had been signed in St. Louis in 1804 by a Sauk delegation that did not expect to enter into land negotiations and lacked the authority to do so, leading many members of the Sauk Nation to regard the treaty as invalid and to resist American attempts to enforce it. This fraudulent treaty and increasing squatter incursions into their traditional territories prompted the Sauk, Meskwaki, Ho-Chunk, and Potawatomi to support the British during the War of 1812. Black Hawk himself fought in that war and incorporated British insignia into his wardrobe for the rest of his life. Under the terms of the Treaty of Ghent of 1814, the US assumed actual, rather than nominal, control over the so-called Northwest Territory, and settlers began arriving en masse. At the conclusion of that war, Saukenuk, the Sauk capital where <em>Over the Levee, Under the Plow<\/em> ended, was the largest city in what would soon become Illinois. Occupied mostly during the growing season when the Sauk returned from their winter hunting grounds in what is now Iowa, Saukenuk\u2019s log houses were surrounded by vegetable and corn fields. The lead deposits of northwestern Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin were mined seasonally by Ho-Chunk, Sauk, and Meskwaki women. These well-stewarded resources were extremely attractive to settlers, and from the 1820s both Sauk and Meskwaki leaders began to complain of finding white squatters living in their Saukenuk homes, stealing their corn, and mining the ore with people they had enslaved.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"grid","image":[{"ID":25896,"id":25896,"title":"03FS2_Blackhawk Park","filename":"03FS2_FraudulentTreaty-scaled.jpg","filesize":1712872,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/03FS2_FraudulentTreaty-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/blackhawk-park-is-indigenous-land-beyond-acknowledgment\/03fs2_fraudulenttreaty\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"by Ryan Griffis","caption":"Commemorative marker to the Treaty of 1804 installed by the Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma and the Meskwaki Tribe\/Sac and Fox of the Mississippi in Iowa.

But that is obviously not all that has happened there, and those who survived the massacre have relationships to this place that cannot be reduced to a simple narrative of domination and extermination. As George Thurman, a direct descendent of Black Hawk and the former Principal Chief of the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma, explains:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To say that Black Hawk still has relevance to the Sac and Fox implies a hold to the past, and that\u2019s true because we are all connected, a part of those who came before and holding on to what they taught us for those yet to come. However, our past is not a fixed point that grows farther away with each new generation; instead, our past is like a bloodline, living, breathing, and growing as we grow. [\u2026]<\/p>\n<p>As a descendant, my perspective about Black Hawk is more personal. He is a very real part of what I bring to the Sac and Fox Nation as its chief and who I am as Sac and Fox. I have visited the places where he walked and could place my own footsteps where his had been. I stood on the banks of the Mississippi River at Bad Axe where 179 years ago I would have been a target for the guns and cannon just for being Sauk.<\/p>\n<p>So many of our people died there. The massacre still echoes within us. It was a tragic ending. But I, a member of that same tribe, stood there at the place of \u201cending\u201d and saw my people of today make offerings at the riverside.

The first is that what has been called the Anthropocene\u2014the intensification and industrialization of land and resource use that has led us to the brink of ecological collapse\u2014is not the inevitable product of humanity writ large but rather the consequence of Euro-American colonialism and the capitalist economic systems it built. Anthropocene Drift (Field Station 2) tried to make visible not just the Anthropocene but also the <em>colonial Anthropocene<\/em>, which is to say it sought to reveal how ongoing processes of colonization are transforming the Earth. The (colonial) Anthropocene is everywhere, of course, but it is particularly palpable in places like Blackhawk Park, Indian Lake, and the former site of the Badger Army Ammunition Plant in Wisconsin, where our field station programming took place.<\/p>\n<p>Our second proposition is that the Anthropocene is an uneven spatial phenomenon. Debates about the start of the Anthropocene are usually framed in temporal rather than spatial terms. <em>When<\/em> did it begin, we ask, not <em>where<\/em> did it start? Dates are singular rather than plural. The Anthropocene started in either 1492, 1610, 1619, <em>or<\/em> 1950. It didn\u2019t start in all these, plus a million other times and places. We contend that the Anthropocene is both a world geo-historical event and a highly variegated and textured condition that is experienced unevenly and very specifically across space, species, gender, race, and class. Anthropocene Drift asked not <em>when<\/em> did the (colonial) Anthropocene begin, but, instead, <em>where<\/em> is it most visible? And where, how, and by whom is it felt most intensely? Part of our interest in the Driftless Area was thus pragmatic, insofar as it ties the Anthropocene to colonialism <em>in place(s)<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s ironic to think about the Anthropocene in terms of temporal golden spikes. Spikes are, after all, driven into space, not time. They are staples connecting one thing with another, an attempt to bridge a gap. According to historian Manu Karuka, that other famous golden spike\u2014the one that connected the First Transcontinental Railroad\u2014\u201cdid not suture the Union after the Civil War; it symbolically finalized the industrial infrastructure of a continental empire where none had existed before.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Manu Karuka, <em>Empire\u2019s Tracks: Indigenous Nations, Chinese Workers, and the Transcontinental Railroad<\/em>. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2019, p. xiv.<\/span><\/span><\/span> But if you wanted to place a spatiotemporal golden spike to mark the start of the Anthropocene in the Upper Midwest (or, as it was known from 1787 to 1803, the Northwest Territory), the confluence of the Bad Axe and Mississippi Rivers\u2014that is to say, Blackhawk Park\u2014would be an ideal location.<\/p>\n<p>Yet framing the \u201cquotidian Anthropocene\u201d as starting here risks reducing this place to the Bad Axe Massacre and reinforcing what literary scholar Mark Rifkin calls \u201csettler time,\u201d a temporality that consigns Indigenous people to the past while selectively admitting them to a present defined entirely in settler terms. Only within settler time could the Black Hawk conflict be described as the \u201clast Indian war east of the Mississippi.\u201d This designation is another instance of the \u201cphenomenon of lasting,\u201d which Ojibwe historian Jean O\u2019Brien identifies as a \u201crhetorical strategy that asserts as a fact the claim that Indians can never be modern.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Jean O\u2019Brien, <em>Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians Out of Existence in New England<\/em>.

It wasn\u2019t even the last Black Hawk war. The longest and most destructive conflict between so-called pioneer immigrants and Native Americans in Utah history, which occurred thirty-three years <em>after<\/em> the conflict in Illinois, is also commonly referred to as the Black Hawk War.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, calling the Anthropocene a new geologic time that \u201cwe\u201d are all in only makes sense in the framework of settler time. If we adopt the Anthropocene as a useful analytic framework, we must take care that it not become a totalizing, teleological narrative, an extension of Rifkin\u2019s \u201csettler time\u201d to which Indigenous people might be admitted, but only on terms that ultimately undermine the heterogeneous temporalities that are forms of sovereignty existing beyond settler recognition.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Mark Rifkin, <em>Beyond Settler Time: Temporal Sovereignty and Indigenous Self-Determination<\/em>.

We were most interested in how the Anthropocene is to be survivable and, crucially, for whom. We must remember that the colonial project that undergirds the Anthropocene was never fully successful: there still exist biocultural <em>and<\/em> temporal \u201crefuges,\u201d sustained by the descendants of the people colonization failed to exterminate. Anthropocene Drift (Field Station 2) was a protracted effort to learn about what novelist and essayist Gerald Vizenor calls \u201csurvivance\u201d (\u201csurvival\u201d plus \u201cresistance\u201d) in the face of extended, violent ecosocial trauma.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Gerald Vizenor, <em>Manifest Manners: Narratives on Postindian Survivance.<\/em> Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1999.<\/span><\/span><\/span> While we sought to listen to and learn from Indigenous people, we do not hold up Indigenous \u201cresilience\u201d as a model for settler society, such that the refusal to be eliminated becomes yet another resource for Euro-Americans to plunder. Rather, we sought to strengthen relationships with and between Indigenous individuals and groups and among settler descendants, out of which we aimed to build practices of survivability that foreground both difference and justice in the (colonial) Anthropocene. Clint Carroll, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, and the seminar\u2019s concluding speaker, describes this as \u201crelational activism,\u201d explaining:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For Indigenous peoples, the political is environmental\u2014our struggles are most fundamentally about and for the land.

Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011, p. xix.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h1>Grounded Relationalities<\/h1>\n<p>In the Vermilion River watershed near the border of Illinois and Indiana, there has been something of a successful campaign against the unregulated impacts of waste from coal-burning power plants, which of course are always located alongside rivers. A coalition of urban and rural organizations\u2014including the Prairie Rivers Network, Faith in Place, Eco-Justice Collaborative, and Earthjustice\u2014mobilized a large, politically diverse population to pressure the Illinois government to force power companies to deal with the problems posed by mountains of coal ash. At one Illinois Environmental Protection Agency hearing, residents packed a gym at Danville Area Community College to argue that the river needs to be understood as a living thing that cannot be legislated or controlled by engineering solutions. These residents represented the largely white, rural, working-class population that voted for Donald Trump in 2016, and we have no illusions that they\u2014whether individually liberal or conservative\u2014were representing anything other than their own interests, in the form of maintaining their property claims and protecting the health of their families and friends. But we could also choose to hear at least some recognition of what one of our participants, the historian Alyosha Goldstein (along with his coauthors Jodi Byrd, Jodi Melamed, and Chandan Reddy) has called \u201cgrounded relationalities\u201d: \u201cIf the grounded relationalities of Indigenous philosophies might tell us anything, then, they remind us that knowledge must always remain grounded as the land calls to us and for us to find our place within the ongoing acts of interconnectivity that surround us.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Jodi A.

Goldstein and his coauthors ask for a consideration of how land, \u201cunderstood not as property or territory but as a source of relation with an agency of its own,\u201d might make other possibilities available, possibilities that recognize the racialized and embodied histories that we have inherited and continue to create.<\/p>\n<p>Although our Field Station research and public program centered Indigenous voices, the opening of the seminar did not include the visible participation of Native Americans in the spiritually, historically, and ecologically charged site of the Bad Axe Massacre. Early in our planning, we spent several weeks asking individuals we know in the Sauk, Meskwaki, Ho-Chunk, and Kickapoo Nations about the value of meeting there to address this history. Several of these people joined us for portions of the seminar but did not respond to or declined the invitation to meet us at Bad Axe. Bill Quackenbush, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer for the Ho-Chunk Nation, who led a four-hour tour with the group on the seminar\u2019s second day, explained his reluctance: \u201cOur internal perspectives, stories, and histories of this and many other traumatic events are only intended to stay within our tribal communities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Quackenbush helped us understand that an invitation to perform or narrate at this site of trauma is inappropriate. It is only within settler time that this \u201chistory\u201d needs to be specifically addressed as such, since it is being actively lived in Indigenous communities every day. If the (colonial) Anthropocene is to be survivable, Indigenous people and settlers will have different roles. As Dakota medicine gardener Francis Bettelyoun explains in artist Corinne Teed\u2019s booklet for the Field Station: \u201cWe [the Dakota people] are Indigenizing. We are not decolonizing.
