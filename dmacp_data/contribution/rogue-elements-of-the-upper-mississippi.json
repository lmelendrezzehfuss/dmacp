thing about sand is that it\u2019s everywhere. It crawls under fingernails, into hair, in between teeth. Sand finds its way into every meal. It sticks to the rims of water bottles. In the mornings, it slinks into the pools of sunscreen we pour into our open palms, then travels over faces and shoulders and knees. At night, sand ducks into the corners of our tents and never leaves.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are troubled by sand, too. On a stretch of the Upper Mississippi just south of Minneapolis, we canoe by a hydrographic survey boat used by the Corps. It\u2019s a black and white vessel, with thin metal arms on either side that drop down into the water, taking measurements of the river\u2019s bottom. Another time, we see one of their dredging boats, slowly scraping away to clear the channel of sediment.<\/p>\n<p>On a normal day, the mighty alluvial river carries an average 400 million tons of silt, sand, gravel, and clay downstream. In June 2019, intense flooding brought even more sediment than usual into the mix. The Corps are constantly working to fulfill their constitutional mandate to keep the nine-foot channel clear, so that barge traffic can continue unabated.<\/p>\n<p>The barges provoke a kind of fearful awe: the industrial sublime. From a safe distance, we watch them churn the water as they pass by, transporting goods up and down the channel. Sometimes we try to guess at what\u2019s inside. Grain is usually a good bet. Coal is an easy one; it\u2019s left uncovered, exposed to the elements. Oil, chemicals, and liquid fertilizer are contained in pipes and barrels. We pass one carrying long, glistening metal blades, laid flat and packed side by side. They look like fangs taken from the mouth of a giant animal. We can\u2019t figure out what they could be.

The green buoys, which have flat tops, have the more perfunctory nickname of \u201ccans.\u201d The key phrase to remember, I\u2019m told, is \u201cred, right, returning.\u201d When the nuns are on your right side, it means you are headed upriver, returning to the headwaters. Together, these navigational buoys form the boundary lines demarcating either side of the 9 foot channel.<\/p>\n<p>Or at least that\u2019s the idea. But, as it turns out, the Corps has to constantly wrangle the buoys to keep them in place. When it floods, they can cut loose entirely, drifting and bobbing their way into places where they shouldn\u2019t be. On one of the islands where we camp near Prairie Du Rocher, Illinois, we find a green can that has run aground and gotten stuck in a pile of driftwood. Upon closer inspection, it turns out to be part of a shelter for a snapping turtle.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"grid","image":[{"ID":27027,"id":27027,"title":"5.

The mile-wide main channel, where she came from, is broad, straight, and unobstructed. The lock and dam system that controls the Upper Mississippi essentially cuts the flow of water up into a series of interconnected pools. At times, it can feel more like moving through a lake than a river. But in side channels like these, narrow streams braid together and come apart in unpredictable patterns. A thick layer of duckweed swirls over the surface of the water, casting a warm green glow into the surrounding humid air. Not far away, clumps of wild rice shoot up, waving in the breeze. In another side channel, we find a beaver lodge carefully constructed from sticks. Pausing near the rogue nun, we take our oars out of the water, rest them on our laps, and let the canoe float for a while.

This was one of the species native to the Upper Mississippi that was prized by settler colonialists around the turn of the twentieth century, who heavily harvested the bivalves to make mother-of-pearl buttons and pins. Higgins\u2019 eyes thrive in free-flowing, deep, clean water. The constant dredging, plus the lock and dam system, have made it difficult for the mussels to bed, to reproduce, and to grow. And because mussels are filter-feeders, they are especially sensitive to the municipal, industrial, and agriculture runoff that pollutes the river. Ironically, if their numbers were greater, mussels could help to reverse these exact processes that make it impossible for them to thrive. Not only do they clean water of chemicals and heavy metals, but they help to maintain the integrity of the riverbed by forming a kind of coral system, which in turn supports microorganisms that feed fish, otters, turtles, and other creatures.<\/p>\n<p>As we canoe down the river, I think about the ghosts of these past ecosystems. I think about a future where they are thriving. I think about how, when a grain of sand or other rogue element makes its way inside the shell of a freshwater mussel, the mollusk goes into defense mode. It starts to coat the intruder with a mineral-rich, iridescent liquid called nacre. Layer upon layer of nacre is what forms a pearl.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Dune<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The sand dredged by the Corps gets dumped onto artificial islands, where we camp at night. One of the islands where we stop, somewhere in between Minnesota and Wisconsin, is piled so high and so steep with fresh sand that it\u2019s become a dune. After we set up our tents for the night and have dinner, we scramble up the dune. Our bodies are tired from a long day of rowing, and it feels good to sit once we\u2019ve reached the top. We have a bird\u2019s-eye view of the river valley, which is not-quite-land and not-quite-water.

Similar to the Mississippi, once the Kushiro River was channelized, unintended consequences quickly followed: the wetlands started to dry up.

I grew up near the Wabash River\u2014a tributary to the Ohio River, which meets the Mississippi just south of St. Louis. The resemblances between Hokkaido and the Midwestern United States are intentional; when the Japanese state colonized Hokkaido in 1869, they followed settler colonial tactics that they learned on visits to the United States. They dispossessed Indigenous Ainu communities of their land and hired American experts in agriculture, engineering, and botany to form the Sapporo Agricultural College. Instead of crops like rice and sweet potato, which are grown in other parts of Japan, Hokkaido became known for milk, cheese, and corn. I\u2019m surprised to find myself thinking of this history so often during my time on the Upper Mississippi.

All of those hours spent together: Eating, sleeping, talking, cooking, sloshing, carrying, observing, singing, rowing.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/w.soundcloud.com\/player\/?url=https%3A\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/859762756%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5XCa8lA2YCb&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; line-break: anywhere; word-break: normal; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif; font-weight: 100;\"><a style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Mississippi.

Imagine what it would have been like to wear masks that whole time\u2014how grimy they would have gotten, with rain and sweat and sand. I suppose we could have rinsed them out every night in the river, then hung them up on branches to dry, hoping they would not blow away by morning.<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 is a rogue element. Jumping from body to body in tiny droplets of spit, the virus has completely disrupted normal patterns of life. Who knows what it will be like when the dust settles? People want to know: \u201cAre handshakes a thing of the past?\u201d \u201cWhat will it be like to kiss someone unfamiliar?\u201d \u201cCan I pet this dog?\u201d All of these are the same question: \u201cHow do I trust the world again?\u201d And within that, there\u2019s another one: \u201cHow do I trust that which is outside of myself?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How did we ever? Our bodies have always been porous\u2014open to germs, to contaminants, to allergens, to parasites. This porosity is something that I have thought about a lot in my research, mostly in the context of the ongoing Fukushima nuclear disaster. Like the virus, radioactive contaminants are invisible. In the immediate aftermath of the nuclear explosions in Japan, the threat of radiation made people afraid of everyday objects that they had taken for granted before. The fruits, vegetables, and fish in the grocery store were suddenly threatening sponges for cesium in the soil. Even the air outside became suspect; people started to dry their laundry indoors, just in case.<\/p>\n<p>In the midst of a global pandemic, openness to the world can feel like a weakness. For those in power\u2014the state, the wealthy, the corporate giants\u2014uncertainty is threatening. This anxiety has been made all the more apparent in the midst of the Black Lives Matter uprisings in the United States, after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, not too far from the sacred confluence of waters at Bdote. These recent events remind us once again that the goal of those in power is maintenance of the status quo: the continuous flow of capital and the preservation of white supremacy. It is those in power who are clamoring for a return to normalcy. It is the same with the Mississippi River: retain the channel at its current depth of nine feet. Make sure the barges can keep moving their goods. Do not rock the boat.<\/p>\n<p>What if some rogue elements offer other possibilities, more just\u2014and more joyful\u2014ways of coexisting? The writer Rebecca Solnit, in <em>A Paradise Built in Hell<\/em>, contends that although our narratives of disasters tend to emphasize moments of chaos and grief, many people also express an exaggerated sense of well-being, meaningfulness, and connection in the trying times that follow a catastrophe. Solnit\u2019s point is not to romanticize disasters, but to understand how moments of disorder might allow us to see potentialities that are already there. \u201cThe possibility of paradise hovers on the cusp of coming into being, so much so that it takes powerful forces to keep such a paradise at bay,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf paradise now arises in hell, it\u2019s because in the suspension of the usual order and the failure of most systems, we are free to live and act another way.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\"> Rebecca Solnit, <em>A Paradise Built in Hell<\/em> (New York: Penguin Books, 2009), 7.<\/span><\/span><\/span> Or, as the poet Masahide Mizuta, a disciple of the haiku master Basho, put it, after a devastating fire in 1688 that destroyed his home:<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">In Lucien Stryk, ed., <em>Zen Poetry: Let the Spring Breeze Enter<\/em>, ed. and trans.

We had been seeing signs of them ever since we reached the St. Louis area and got past the lock and dams, where the river starts to flow more freely. The islands around there, thick with willow trees, are a beaver paradise. All night long, we heard them slapping their stiff tails on the surface of the water, making their disdain for our presence known. Then, late one night, we were sitting on the shore when we noticed something small bobbing out in the water, maybe ten feet away. It was the head of a beaver. He was floating on his back, enjoying the moonlight.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3056,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:13","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:13","post_content":"","post_title":"Emily Sekine","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"emily-sekine","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-09-16 14:28:44","post_modified_gmt":"2019-09-16 12:28:44","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/emily-sekine\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/emily-sekine\/","acf":{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"Sekine"}}],"projects":[{"ID":3505,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-22 11:49:27","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-22 09:49:27","post_content":"<p>What modes of collecting, representing, and knowing are appropriate to meet the conceptual and practical challenges of the Anthropocene? Which narrative forms and styles can help us to document states of flux and transformation, across multiple scales of space and time?<\/p>\n  <p>As a traveler on the <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em> , I propose to create an Upper Mississippi River Field Diary, with multimedia entries to be posted online. Each Field Diary entry will focus on a specific object, or \u201cspecimen,\u201d found along the way. The selected specimens will be eclectic, storied, and difficult to categorize, creating the cumulative effect of a cabinet of curiosities. The spirit and tone of the Field Diary will alternate between wondrous discovery and ambivalent recounting. In addition to text, the Field Diary entries may include photographs, sketches, sound, and video, according to the demands of the object in question. By playing with the conventions of the travelog or field survey genres, my goal is to question how we measure, observe, and make sense of the rapidly changing landscapes of the present.<\/p>\n <p>What modes of collecting, representing, and knowing are appropriate to meet the conceptual and practical challenges of the Anthropocene? Which narrative forms and styles can help us to document states of flux and transformation, across multiple scales of space and time?<\/p>\n<p>This project is inspired in part by the <em>Anthropocene Slam<\/em> event held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014, in which individual presenters shared an object that was representative of the Anthropocene, and which audience members then voted on for inclusion in a cabinet of curiosities. In the volume that emerged from the event, titled <em>Future Remains: A Cabinet of Curiosities for the Anthropocene<\/em>, editors Gregg Mitman, Marco Armiero, and Robert S. Emmett (2018) make the case for an object-oriented approach to understanding planetary change. Objects, they note, crystallize the intertwined relationships between nature and culture, past and present, local and global. Importantly, they also offer possibilities for multiple futures, while at the same time questioning the notion of human exceptionalism. By curating and juxtaposing a number of different specimens in the Field Diary, I hope to bring to life some of the complex attachments and ecologies that make up the Upper Mississippi River region, weaving together stories about people, creatures, plants, and landscapes with broader social, political, economic, technical, and geo-atmospheric processes and rhythms.<\/p>\n<p>Once my time as a Traveler has concluded, the Field Diary entries will be a jumping-off point for other contributions as well: I plan to develop some of the entries into longer nonfiction pieces that speak to the broader themes of the field stations, such as river-engineering, rewilding, agriculture, and biome change. In addition, I am interested in writing about how the project as a whole is negotiating between different ways of knowing and apprehending the landscape (for example, between artistic and scientific observational approaches, or between indigenous and settler-colonial cosmologies). Using the sound clips and interviews with fellow participants I collect during the Journey, I will also create an audio story about the collaborative nature of this research project. This story will be included as an episode for a podcast about fieldwork that I am launching with my colleague Christina Kim Chilcote next year under the title <em>The Field.<\/em><\/p>\n","post_title":"A Field Diary of the Upper Mississippi, 2019","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-field-diary-of-the-upper-mississippi","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-07-17 18:09:41","post_modified_gmt":"2020-07-17 16:09:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2775,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=3505","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-journey\/a-field-diary-of-the-upper-mississippi\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":4573,"id":4573,"title":"Allium cernuum (Nodding Onion)","filename":"Merged.jpg","filesize":122717,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Merged.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-journey\/a-field-diary-of-the-upper-mississippi\/merged\/","alt":"","author":"9","description":"","caption":"Left: Allium cernuum (Nodding Onion) from \"Addisonia\" an illustrated journal that was published from 1916-1964 by the New York Botanical Garden.
