deceptively fluffy, this is a plastic sheep. It is both deeply personal and mass-produced (although the sheep must have been sewn by hand). Soft synthetic fibers enclose the hard plastic casing and tape measure. It will be around long after I, and those I love, have lost our animate forms. Yet, given time, even plastic will break down, although it will not decompose. If it breaks and ends up in a landfill, what might it look like several decades from now, or in half a century? If it is washed out to sea, what will be left of it after a hundred years of the persistent forces of waves and sunlight? In truth, I have no idea. I do not know the chemistry of decay, nor the exact make-up of this measuring tape. The value of this imaginative exercise, for me, lies elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>My measuring sheep lends some form to my thoughts about the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene is a big word that is generating many others. It makes me feel a little tired. This measuring tape is the product of greater technological developments, as well as of standardization\u2014standardization that simultaneously enables collaboration, trade, and communication, and feeds into global hegemony and the loss of diversity. Given its material composition, it will outlast me. However, drawing the imagined future of a measuring sheep helps me scale down in time and space; from the caveman\u2019s fire, the steam engine, or nuclear physics, to what my hand holds here and now.

Which tools, in terms of coevolutionary dynamics between man and machine, are needed to ensure human survival in the technosphere?<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more than 3.5 billion years, the biosphere has been a continuous, highly active component of the Earth, interlinked with the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. As an emergent system, it modulates the conditions of the Earth\u2019s surface, its evolution over time including major innovations such as photosynthesis and the emergence of animals. This dynamic has become more complex with the appearance of the technosphere. In one view the latter is less a conscious construct than an emergent system which humans no longer fully control, with dynamics partly modulated by human actions and needs, and partly by the serendipitous emergence and spread of system-altering components such as computers and their unintended consequences. The technosphere\u2014which like the biosphere is a means to collect, transform, and store energy and matter\u2014co-evolves to maintain itself and appropriate more of the Earth\u2019s surface and materials. Alternatively the technosphere may be viewed as a socio-epistemic, i.e. a knowledge-based system, embodying a fundamental dilemma: individual actions are controlled by thought, while collective actions are controlled by institutions that contain shared knowledge, but cannot think, while participating individuals do not necessarily realize the consequences of collective action. This, together with the limited co-evolutionary dynamics of its epistemic component, lies at the root of the uncontrollability of the technosphere. Collective actions can reach global scale, affecting human survival, with knowledge-production still determined locally. Yet, Enlightenment-style ideas may survive, perhaps, sufficient to ensure human survival.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this seminar, we wanted to consider the biosphere and technosphere, technological and scientific progress, in terms of co-evolutionary dynamics; the cognitive, material, and social dimensions of knowledge; and the major steps of socio-epistemic evolution in human history.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Co-evolution of the Technosphere","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-co-evolution-of-the-technosphere","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-03 12:42:32","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-03 10:42:32","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20703","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-co-evolution-of-the-technosphere\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":23587,"id":23587,"title":"HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution","filename":"HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution.jpg","filesize":1566588,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-co-evolution-of-the-technosphere\/hkw_technosphere_coevolution\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_technosphere_coevolution","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20703,"date":"2020-04-02 15:52:22","modified":"2020-04-02 15:53:02","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":7810,"height":4778,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution-768x470.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":470,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution-300x184.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":184,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution-768x470.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":470,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution-1400x856.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":856,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":940,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1253,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Technosphere_Coevolution.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":979}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biosphere has budded off a second global \u201csphere,\u201d the technosphere, a technology-based system on which humans now depend\u2014and which they find hard to control.
