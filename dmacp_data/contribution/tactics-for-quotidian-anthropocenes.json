with Different Modes of Expression and Representation: Community Archiving Project<\/h1>\n<p>A key aim of the St. Louis Field Campus was to experiment with different modes of scholarly and artistic expression, and to develop a set of tactics that participants could take back into their own field sites. For this, on the one hand, we invited Yanni Loukissas and Emily Catedral of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/stlmaproom.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">St. Louis Map Room<\/a>, who engaged us in a community-mapping project. On the other, the artists involved in the campus brought with them their rich experience with materials and forms, of which we had learned previously in both the technical applications and in the online meetings that took place before the campus. In addition to mapping, we decided to focus on different forms of communicative expression: photography, film, podcast, drawing, and walking tours. Participants had a chance to sign up for groups according to their own interests.<\/p>\n<p>However, we also envisioned the field campus as a tactic in and of itself, as a way to engage participants in new forms of documentation or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mitpress.mit.edu\/books\/rogue-archives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rogue archiving<\/a>\u201c,\u201d a method attuned to the demands of anthropocenics. We visited two local history museums, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/wrrmuseum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wood River Refinery History Museum<\/a>, located on the grounds of the refinery itself, and the Wood River Museumlocated in Wood River, Illinois. In the Refinery Museum, we interviewed the curators, who themselves had worked at the plant, and we discussed the challenges of safeguarding the history (with all of its complexities) to ensure it remained alive and vital. We also visited the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site, near the convergence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Here we encountered a much more formal public museum, but also one that struggles to place the history of American exploration within the broader context of struggles over resources, racial and Indigenous violence, and the meta-narratives of the American Empire. Our discussions, here, with the staff and guides were lively, and opened up new ways of considering the possibilities for localized Anthropocene archives.<\/p>\n<p>Though we welcomed making use of the Disaster-STS Network platform\u2019s capacity for collaboration, we also wanted to allow for the local means of documentation and presentation. For this, we prepared a final exhibition at Granite City Art and Design District (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gcadd.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G-CADD<\/a>), where we installed each group\u2019s project. These included a film and photo essay, which we projected on to the wall; a range of short podcasts; imaginary \u201cAnthropocene Tours\u201d; and a large-scale map that documented the St. Louis Anthropocene Field Campus. We also provided a large-format poster for each of the twelve questions we were asking, so that participants were able to contribute their insights in a semi-structured way. The research findings and artistic contributions were deliberately provisional, but they serve as a model for future field campuses as a way to connect analogue practices with the digital archive.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, this engagement will continue through a series of online meetings, called the Open Seminar. In\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/disaster-sts-network.org\/content\/quotidian-anthropocene-bi-monthly-calls\/essay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bi-monthly meetings<\/a>, we will discuss and prepare for the next campus, the New Orleans Anthropocene Field Campus, which will take place immediately before the annual meeting of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.4s2019.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Society for Social Studies of Science (4S)<\/a>. The seminars are open to anybody who is interested in attending.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3177,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:23","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:23","post_content":"","post_title":"Kim Fortun","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"kim-fortun","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-22 15:59:30","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-22 13:59:30","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/kim-fortun\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/kim-fortun\/","acf":{"first_name":"Kim","last_name":"Fortun"}},{"ID":3315,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:36","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:36","post_content":"","post_title":"Scott Gabriel Knowles","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"scott-gabriel-knowles","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-24 16:08:06","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-24 14:08:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/scott-gabriel-knowles\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/scott-gabriel-knowles\/","acf":{"first_name":"Scott Gabriel","last_name":"Knowles"}},{"ID":3122,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:18","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:18","post_content":"","post_title":"Jason Ludwig","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"jason-ludwig","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-25 16:18:47","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-25 14:18:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/jason-ludwig\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/jason-ludwig\/","acf":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Ludwig"}},{"ID":3350,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:38","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:38","post_content":"","post_title":"Tim Sch\u00fctz","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"tim-schuetz","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-25 16:21:11","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-25 14:21:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/tim-schuetz\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/tim-schuetz\/","acf":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Sch\u00fctz"}}],"projects":[{"ID":2789,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-20 19:41:38","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-20 17:41:38","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">How has the Mississippi River region been documented, analyzed, and described thus far, and how have these practices set the stage for further research?<\/p>\n  <p>The Anthropocene is global and planetary.
