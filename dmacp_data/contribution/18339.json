He also indicated another couple of concepts similar to floating\/flying like gliding\/soaring. I learnt many other things about the mechanisms of floating and flying from an article he introduced me to: Jasper F. Kok, Eric J. R. Parteli, Timothy I. Michaels, and Diana Bou Karam, \u201cThe Physics of Wind-blown Sand and Dust,\u201d <em>Reports on Progress in Physics<\/em>, vol. 75, no. 10, 106901 (2012). The article is interesting; it deals not only with the phenomena of things that fly on Earth, but also things on Mars and the other planets that fly (or float). Imagine flying in Mars! I was reminded of Szerszynski\u2019s marvelous essay about the possible religion (Mangalayana Buddhism) in Mars in the twenty-second century. See Bronislaw Szerszynski, \u201cLiberation through Hearing in the Planetary Transition: Funerary practices in twenty-second-century Mangalayana Buddhism,\u201d in: Katrin Klingan, Ashkan Sepahvand, Christoph Rosol, and Bernd M.

I thank him for all of this.<\/span><\/span> They splash when strong wind hits them and the aerodynamic lift exceeds the gravitational and inter-particle forces. Some small grains of sand move from the Sahara desert and reach the South American continent. Recent research points out that this kind of immigration of the sands enriches the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the sand particles fall back to the Earth before they can reach the continent. When sand drops into the Atlantic Ocean, it provides nutrition to the sea in that area. Sands of the deserts contain minerals, especially bio-available iron and phosphorus, and the fallen sand particles with minerals are the origins of the richness of the ocean. But such flying is only possible for small particles. I cannot take off in the wind (in normal conditions).<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":18353,"id":18353,"title":"fig2_Terada_Float","filename":"fig2_Terada_Float.jpg","filesize":689241,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/18339\/fig2_terada_float\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Image by Masahiro Terada","caption":"","name":"fig2_terada_float","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":18339,"date":"2020-02-05 14:02:46","modified":"2020-02-05 14:03:01","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2288,"height":1712,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float-768x575.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":575,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float-300x224.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":224,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float-768x575.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":575,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float-1400x1048.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":1048,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1149,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1532,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fig2_Terada_Float-1600x1197.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1197}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><center><\/center>Floating in my memory.

Exploring this concept from the perpsective of the Aerocene: a nascent, collaborative, speculative vision of the future.<\/p>\n  <p>Is a different kind of technosphere possible? What forms of knowledge might a different technosphere require and engender? In order to explore such questions, we will take as our point of departure the Aerocene: a nascent, collaborative, speculative vision of the future.<\/p>\n <p>The concept of the \u201ctechnosphere\u201d developed by Peter Haff refers to an emergent, semi-autonomous \u201csphere\u201d of the Earth, comparable to the hydrosphere or biosphere, currently being produced by a planet in flux. A growing number of human and nonhuman entities are being locked into this technosphere, which itself is tied into an accelerating exploitation of fossil fuels and other material resources, and depends on particular forms of knowledge production. The sort of questions one should ask therefore are: Is a different kind of technosphere possible? What forms of knowledge might a different technosphere require and engender? In order to explore such questions, we will take as our point of departure the Aerocene: a nascent, collaborative, speculative vision of the future proposed by Berlin-based artist Tom\u00e1s Saraceno. In the Aerocene, societies become untethered from the Earth\u2019s surface. Instead of relying on the extraction of resources from the Earth\u2019s subterranean sinks and combusting them, the Aerocene, by contrast, simply encloses volumes of ambient air in envelopes, and thereby embarks in a collaboration with elemental flows of energy and matter. The Aerocene performs experiments in lighter-than-air motion, without fossil fuels or refined gases, to sustain the movements of a range of aerostatic devices for scientific research, for human transport\u2014or even for human habitation in what Saraceno terms Cloud Cities. The Aerocene invites us to develop new forms of collaborative knowledge production, which combine the sciences and humanities, craft and philosophy, speculation and sensory experience.<\/p>\n<p>We will take the Aerocene as an alternative future technosphere, founded on a shift in the dominant global \u201cthermodynamic imaginary\u201d (Kiel Moe). Rather than immediately moving to technoscientific \u201csolutions\u201d and thereby implicitly consenting to a particular vision of the future, we will try to suspend entrenched disciplinary habits of thought and speculate about which future we actively wish to create. In exploring the Aerocene we will use techniques to unlearn ingrained, modernist \u201cbifurcations\u201d of thought (Alfred North Whitehead). We will develop forms of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity that resist the allure of prematurely integrated forms of knowledge and that instead experience creative agonism between modes and ontologies of knowing (Andrew Barry).<\/p>\n<p>In groups, participants will bring together a range of different kinds of knowledge in order to articulate alternative versions of the Aerocene, flesh out particular aspects of Aerocene living, tackle distinct knowledge challenges, or raise objections to the idea of the Aerocene as an alternative technosphere. Playing with these different kinds of knowledge, we will also explore the different ways of knowing and sensing that the Aerocene makes possible, as we capture ambient air, release its latent powers, and make our bodies sensitive to its elemental properties.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Knowing (in) the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"knowing-in-the-anthropocene","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-06-04 14:57:34","post_modified_gmt":"2020-06-04 12:57:34","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9144,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=18200","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2016\/knowing-in-the-anthropocene\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":18201,"id":18201,"title":"seminar_04_Knowing the Anthropocene","filename":"seminar_04_vis_up01.jpg","filesize":81089,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2016\/knowing-in-the-anthropocene\/seminar_04_vis_up01\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"","caption":"","name":"seminar_04_vis_up01","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":18200,"date":"2020-02-03 14:38:46","modified":"2020-02-03 16:02:59","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1140,"height":641,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01-768x432.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":432,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01-300x169.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":169,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01-768x432.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":432,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01.jpg","large-width":1140,"large-height":641,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01.jpg","1536x1536-width":1140,"1536x1536-height":641,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01.jpg","2048x2048-width":1140,"2048x2048-height":641,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_04_vis_up01.jpg","feature-width":1140,"feature-height":641}},"teaser_text":"<p>Is a different technosphere possible?
