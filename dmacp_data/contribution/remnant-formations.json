However, because the US Army also used the state game-lands site for training purposes, unintentional fires sometimes occurred due to the use of artillery and weapons; likewise, spent ammunition littered the site. Managed forestry and logging were conducted at the publicly managed sites and I had to obtain national and state permits to collect ants there. The electrical utility company\u2019s site in New York allowed no fire maintenance and instead mowed and cut vegetation to maintain space for the power lines.

An amateur ant expert, Ray Sanwald (Figure 1), was my local guide, as he has been for many international ant researchers looking to sample species native only to that locale. Ray has lived in this area of Long Island continuously for over seventy years. Over that time, his house lot, which had been at the far edge of agricultural land in the 1950s, in the intervening time has been engulfed by suburban development.<\/p>\n<p>While I certainly altered the landscape with my own ant collecting (digging as deep as two or three meters to obtain the ants and removing the colonies in the process), Ray had begun to actually collect and relocate ants to a two-acre plot of land near his house to create a biodiversity sanctuary for native ant species that were in danger of becoming extinct due to habitat loss. Ray\u2019s particular interest in \u201cslave-making\u201d ants and species of this group were of high priority for his singular conservation effort. He was very supportive and encouraging of my collecting because he saw my species as competitors to the slave-making ants that he was trying to preserve\u2014anything that aided their removal was a positive change in his eyes.<\/p>\n<p>There is no other person known to have the expertise Ray has with that local ant fauna, and this has implications for future study into the slave-making species, which are of great interest to a global group of researchers. Like the national and state forests, the Long Island Pine Barrens are garden versions of those that existed before. The habitats within the utility power line areas and similar sites present interesting cases in which patterns of otherwise uncontrolled urban and suburban development are interrupted, although often they function in support of those very forms of development they partially resist. Perhaps there is some very loose comparison to be made to various areas of \u201cnew wilderness\u201d that result from a mixture of both management and conflict, like the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site\u2014both of which are forms of inadvertent nature preservation born out of the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":23195,"id":23195,"title":"Anthropogenic Landscaps_A Yang_2","filename":"AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2.jpg","filesize":95629,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/remnant-formations\/al_b1-9_yang_15_12_14_image2\/","alt":"","author":"97","description":"","caption":"The Apalachicola National Forest site in Florida; note the burn marks at the base of the trees.","name":"al_b1-9_yang_15_12_14_image2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":22240,"date":"2020-03-31 08:57:38","modified":"2020-03-31 08:58:03","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":498,"height":723,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2.jpg","thumbnail-width":498,"thumbnail-height":723,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2-207x300.jpg","medium-width":207,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2.jpg","medium_large-width":498,"medium_large-height":723,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2.jpg","large-width":498,"large-height":723,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2.jpg","1536x1536-width":498,"1536x1536-height":723,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2.jpg","2048x2048-width":498,"2048x2048-height":723,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/AL_b1.9_Yang_15_12_14_image2.jpg","feature-width":498,"feature-height":723}}]}]},"contributors":[{"ID":2957,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:05","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:05","post_content":"","post_title":"Andrew Yang","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"andrew-yang","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-25 15:25:57","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-25 13:25:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/andrew-yang\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/andrew-yang\/","acf":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Yang"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20767,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2014-11-23 18:11:58","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 17:11:58","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">Anthropogenic Landscapes ground us in the Anthropocene.

People embody, and reflect in the space they inhabit, the social and economic changes occurring in the larger context.
