This self-powered facility is spread across farmland near the suburb of Werribee on the coastal plains beside Port Phillip Bay, a region where the Wathaurung people\u2014the traditional owners of the land\u2014fished, foraged, and shaped their surroundings in the centuries before the plant began operating in 1897. The WTP is now run by Melbourne Water, a government-owned, permit-granting body that decides what gets in and out of the city\u2019s water system and its infrastructures.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, human waste has the ultimate level access to the WTP: A direct line runs into the facility through roughly thirty kilometers of pipes and drains. Waste is not all that gets in: There is also a ghost town, once inhabited by sewage workers, now used to exhibit work by local artists; and there are shallow lagoons where bacteria are encouraged to metabolize excrement, their work interrupted only by human \u201cpoo divers\u201d who emerge from the ponds\u2014victorious and feces-covered\u2014after mending broken equipment. Waste draws film crews, too: Set designers have currently turned one section of the plant into a rural village in sub-Saharan Africa. Birds come in their thousands, some from as far away as Siberia, followed by birdwatchers who require their own permits to visit the protected wetlands inside the plant. And on a brisk, sunny day in August, a range of invasive species\u2014anthropologists, geographers and other social scientists interested in human waste\u2014were given permission to ask the plant and its workers some questions about the future.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":11867,"id":11867,"title":"McKean2","filename":"McKean2.png","filesize":3635766,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2.png","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/telling-time-through-lagoons-of-human-waste-at-the-western-treatment-plant\/mckean2\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Photograph courtesy Google maps","caption":"Aerators oxygenate the raw sewage, keeping communities of aerobic bacteria alive and reducing odors that once floated across the nearby highway and into surrounding suburban sprawl.","name":"mckean2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":11847,"date":"2019-09-19 16:17:01","modified":"2020-05-05 15:07:54","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/png","type":"image","subtype":"png","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1700,"height":1100,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2-768x497.png","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":497,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2-300x194.png","medium-width":300,"medium-height":194,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2-768x497.png","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":497,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2-1400x906.png","large-width":1400,"large-height":906,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2.png","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":994,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2.png","2048x2048-width":1700,"2048x2048-height":1100,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2-48x48.png","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/McKean2-1600x1035.png","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1035}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>On a dirt road beyond the foaming bacterial lagoons of section 55E, this busload of researchers is wondering aloud how Melbourne\u2019s main sewage processing facility will survive the coming centuries. One of our guides, Paul Balassone, the Principal of Cultural Heritage at Melbourne Water, explains that storm surges are already disrupting certain processes at the plant. Wearing a high-visibility vest and steel-toed boots, he gestures through the windows of the bus to the waste-filtering lagoon systems outside, which contain massive ponds that are barely above sea level. Although the plant is prepared for risks, a projected rise in sea level of one hundred centimeters or more over the coming century is still a hard-to-imagine scenario.<\/p>\n<p>Traveling deeper within the plant, we pass fields of canola grown with recycled sewage water, disused stables for the thousands of livestock that once grazed here, and Lollypop Creek with its unseen population of growling grass frogs\u2014endangered amphibians who seem to enjoy the altered ecology of the facility. Finally, the bus approaches the biosolids: tall mounds of dry, insoluble, nonbiodegradable waste that has passed through the bodies of Melbourne residents over the past decades. These human-made geological formations loom over the bus, silently holding toxins and sparkling with minerals. Balassone tells us that the managers of the plant are not quite sure about what to do with all of this biomatter, and invite us to think of potential uses.
