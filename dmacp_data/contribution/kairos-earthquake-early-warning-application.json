These cities are located all over the world, with an unexpected preference for plate boundaries. As we are living in the age of construction on our planet, earthquakes that did not have very much impact before will shake urban agglomerations with millions of people in the future. Large parts of these settlements have no earthquake resistance and no strict building codes have been applied. They are rubble in waiting. In fact, for many there is no plan and no hope of fixing them before they collapse. These cities have become a neglected weapon of mass destruction, and an epicentral hit on such a megacity has the potential to kill a million people. Actually, it is not the earthquakes that kill, the buildings do.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>cf.

This is the moment of the theoretical alert. This alert is based on the efficient early-onset registering and de-noising of the primary p-wave signals and fully automated analysis of the information they carry. This is the first evidence of a quake that seismometers can detect. Automatic phase-picker algorithms are trimmed on identifying the changes in some of the characteristics of incoming p-wave signals, such as the energy, wavelet coefficient, frequency content, and signal amplitude.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>E.

They make it to the surface before the arrival of the slower but more damaging s-waves, the low-frequency waves that bring the destructive forces; when the shaking gets serious. The latter are the gut-wrenching movements that crush buildings and create landslides. The p-wave-based alert of the theoretical arrival of the s-waves anticipates the strength and location of the ground shaking and its onset time, and offers a few seconds for rescue. A few seconds that vary depending on the underground liquid and solid structures, and your distance from the source of the earthquake.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>M.

These growing cities are challenged by the fact that, in the future, the performance of megacities will interface with the performance of mega-earthquakes; the space and the city itself have transformed and become spaces capable of sensing. Now, the city is embedded with innumerable sensory devices and objects underground and on the surface; equipped with MEMS accelerometers, cameras, RFIDs, and GPS that carry the signals of an accelerating ground. Boreholes, civil structures, building walls, furnishings, commodities, mobile phones, contact lenses, implants, and an infinitely expanding number of consumer and communication devices contribute to the composition of an advanced, real-time structural and spatial monitoring of an increasingly refined grid. This cyber-physical system is incorporating \u201coff the shelf sensor, processing, and communication components into low cost sensing units.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Picozzi et al., \u201cApplications of Low-cost, Wireless, Self-organising System (SOESEWIN).\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All sensing units communicate with each other via wireless links, and the seismic data are streamed in real time to huge data centers worldwide using the network of the Internet, the Internet of a billion things.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>cf.

Considering the interior composition and equipment of the building, special sensor-equipped devices stamp critical paths or positions on the site, to indicate escape routes.

It revolves around a basic risk assessment, a classification setup that mainly evaluates the possible types of adverse effects and intensities that are performed by all entities\u2014structures, objects, and people\u2014and the probability of damage at your target location in the upcoming shaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your danger<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An earthquake will transfer and spread its energy and intensity over the entire surface layer. However, depending on where you reside, your individual exposure to an earthquake will generate a highly specific and individual scenario of danger; and ultimately, the person you are will essentially affect your survivability and the consequences of the danger you are in. Therefore, on top of everything described so far, the decision making process of KAIROS incorporates an overarching individual footprint. A first set up will establish personalized mean thresholds for the decision making implementation system. The set up includes accessing your medical records according to a detailed assessment of your physical and mental condition, executed by our medical experts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, your navigation instructions will also vary depending on your physical and mental conditions, and skills. A mobility impairment, advanced age, a physical disability, a wheelchair, a lower level of fitness, an infant, or a tendency to panic would prompt an instruction that is distinct from that received by a practitioner of extreme sports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extraordinary accuracy is necessary when making decisions over risky passages, where you absolutely should not get stuck when the shaking starts. For example, stairs are a part of the building likely to cause or suffer a lot of damage. People who get onto the stairs are often chopped up by the stair treads and are horribly mutilated.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>David Mikkelson, \u201cTriangle of Life: Does a \u2018Triangle of Life\u2019 article provide good advice about earthquake safety?,\u201d Snopes.com (posted March 31, 2014), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.snopes.com\/inboxer\/household\/triangle.asp\">online<\/a>.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in the final decision-making process, special evolutionary algorithms are entering the stage of the test\u2014bed stage.

In addition to the personal data histories, they will incorporate into their decision-making the anticipated shaking and the theoretical arrival time of the s-waves, the whole damage risk-assessment, your GPS position, and the real-time monitoring of your physical and mental conditions in the countdown to the earthquake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We use eye-implanted sensors, eye projectors, and eye cameras\u2014RFIDs, which are the required implants\u2014to provide our algorithms with significant information by measuring GPS, sight direction, gestures, camera view (mimicking your own view), and significant body variables and variations such as blood pressure and temperature.

The heat(color)map is used to associate statistical values of adversity with positions or regions in space. This digital navigation system will pop up on your mobile or implanted eye display at the moment the first early-warning alarm arrives.

Respecting and exploiting the ambiguity of red as a sign of danger that attracts and repels at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The KAIROS visualization algorithms calculate the color ramps and shadings in real time according to the statistical values of anticipated damage along the escape route, in balance with your color presets and the on-site time delays during the countdown, always monitoring the quality of color adjustment. So, the color mapping of your territory is a process of constant versioning, and, while constantly adapting in real time, the procedure has to decide between the two main mapping and perception styles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first mapping style pops up if red is your color of immediacy, emphasis, and highlight. This is put into practice by favoring a color palette characterized by small, enclosed areas of an extreme red color. It creates expressive and clear visual patterns on a plan, patterns that attract your attention immediately by using your color for messages and affirmation. It is the color you will follow intuitively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if your heightened sensibility to red equates the color with danger and evasion, a second navigation display is provided that provokes the opposite effect, by drawing a map shaded with unrelieved red over large areas adjacent to each other. These are the key danger zones that you will avoid and repel instinctively.

With the advent of the Internet, new intermediation services have emerged, such as search engines and social networks. Intermediation is ensured by algorithms, which \u201cdecide\u201d what is relevant for people. Even as algorithms aim to satisfy users, they also optimize for other parameters, such as establishing a uniform balance between supply and demand. Intermediation also enables the sharing of resources, crowdsourcing, and crowdfunding by making people aware of potential consumers or producers of services. To explore the contemporary architecture of algorithmic intermediation, we focus on \u201csmartness,\u201d which has risen to prominence as a catchall term legitimating sensor and \u201cbig data\u201d analytics to facilitate the algorithmic intermediation among humans, technologies, and the environment. \u201cSmartness\u201d has come to take on a morally virtuous connotation as a purportedly necessary, even mandatory, set of practices by which to sustain or preserve human life in the face of environmental security, and financial insecurities. Much of this discourse is driven by corporations, as evidenced by the popularity of company tags such as IBM\u2019s recent corporate slogans (\u201cThink Smart\u201d; \u201cSmarter Planet\u201d), and products such as the \u201csmart phone\u201d and the \u201csmart home,\u201d and \u201csmart cities,\u201d all of which aim to integrate environmentally responsible practices, optimize consumer behavior, and operate as technologies of cybernetic governance.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Algorithmic Intermediation and Smartness","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-algorithmic-intermediation-and-smartness","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-27 15:53:27","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-27 14:53:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9144,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=18577","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2016\/seminar-algorithmic-intermediation-and-smartness\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":18578,"id":18578,"title":"seminar_07_vis_up01","filename":"seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","filesize":64530,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2016\/seminar-algorithmic-intermediation-and-smartness\/seminar_07_vis_up01\/","alt":"","author":"11","description":"","caption":"","name":"seminar_07_vis_up01","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":18577,"date":"2020-02-10 10:12:58","modified":"2020-02-10 10:52:40","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1140,"height":641,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01-768x432.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":432,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01-300x169.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":169,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01-768x432.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":432,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","large-width":1140,"large-height":641,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","1536x1536-width":1140,"1536x1536-height":641,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","2048x2048-width":1140,"2048x2048-height":641,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/seminar_07_vis_up01.jpg","feature-width":1140,"feature-height":641}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What forms of futurity, speculation, and life do algorithmic intermediations produce?
