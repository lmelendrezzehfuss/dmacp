The triple-principle frame (social justice, environmental responsibility, and cultural acceptance) was used as a reference. The idea consisted of simulating possible trajectories of societal change by imagining <em>strong sustainability<\/em>options leading to socio-ecosystemic resilience, i.e. more frugal, self-supporting societies. Ultimately, this approach allows one to anticipate the societal and ecological transition costs of a zero-debt society (economic, social, environmental, educational, etc.) as an aid to decision-making. Two hypotheses were considered that state:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis 1:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2211R (available resources) = vital needs + wants (resources could cover both needs and wants; carrying capacity at equilibrium).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis 2:<\/strong><br \/>\n(vital needs + wants) &gt; \u2211R &gt; vital needs (carrying capacity &gt; available resources).<\/p>\n<p>A development model based on zero socio-ecosystemic debt was suggested in order to systematically:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internalize the socio-ecosystemic negative externalities (no dumping);<\/li>\n<li>Adjust resources to comply with the vital\/fundamental needs of individuals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To this end, it appeared necessary to reconfigure institutions ensuring legitimate, transparent, equitable access to resources and to design instruments and norms for social justice (such as equitable access to resources, limiting the use of private property to encourage better use of the commons), and environmental responsibility (including policies on price, taxation, and subsidies).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<div>\n<div class=\"_3ngFjWKpOr0BV7e4JfgnKT\">\n<h1>2.
