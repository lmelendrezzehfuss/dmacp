How humanity inadvertently shifted the whole planet so radically and in such a self-damaging manner is now the subject of intense debate. Different narratives of blame locate relative responsibility with various sectors, activities and groups. Common candidates include farming, colonial plantations, industrialization and urbanisation, and the post-war acceleration in consumption and pollution. From a material perspective, there is a strong geological rationale for naming each as a major source of planetary-scale environmental and social impacts and \u201cterraforming.\u201d Indeed, this is how these various proposed starting dates for the Anthropocene have been identified: through the pursuit of widespread and sharp enough changes in the geological record to count as what geologists call a \u201cGolden Spike\u201d, the prerequisite for declaring a new epoch. Yet this search for the physical origins of the Anthropocene in the historical record needs to extend far past physical signals and their proximate causes to the visions, goals and assumptions underlying the activities involved, including what Ian Hacking would call styles of reasoning. Reading the Anthropocene in this light reveals many limitations within the outlooks, ideas and values that informed the activities mentioned above, including an often willful ignorance of the immediate impacts on people, nonhumans and the abiotic environment, as well as the \u201cunknown unknown\u201d of the long-term, accumulative changes being wrought.<\/p>\n<p>In combing history for the sources of our present problems, it is easy to lament past generations\u2019 failure to care about the future. Yet their ignorance of future effects should not be conflated with a disinterest in the future per se. In fact, past fixations with and assumptions about the future were core to the problematic styles of thought that enabled Anthropocene-inducing actions. Some of the proposed start dates for the Anthropocene are notable not just for the physical changes they mark, but for the ideas about the future with which they were associated. In the remainder of this essay, I consider three of them.<\/p>\n<p>The earliest of the three is an increasingly prominent origin date for the Anthropocene: the beginning of the Colonial era, when certain Europeans began their Earth-changing project of finding, appropriating and exploiting lands, natures, and peoples across the planet. This \u201corganizational transition,\u201d as Simon Lewis and Mark Maslin call it, was essentially about creating a globalized economy. As they put it, \u201cA new world order driven by the search for private profit was born.\u201d Key to this globalized economy was merchant capitalism: the distribution of products around the world via increasingly long transport routes involving ships. Conducting business through long, ocean-faring supply chains demanded a new comfort with uncertainty, notably a new and positive calculative attitude toward risk. The dangers of merchant capitalism meant that the successful \u201ccreation of profits depended on foresight and planning.\u201d This led to a new vision of time as &#8220;a commodity to be used, saved or sold to create profits, rather than something that was simply doled out by the creator&#8221;.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":11651,"id":11651,"title":"Producing the Anthropocene_Ships in Distress off a Rocky Coast","filename":"1.png","filesize":283042,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1.png","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/producing-the-anthropocene-producing-the-future\/1-2\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Painting by Ludolf Bakhuizen","caption":"Ships in Distress off a Rocky Coast.

Here, the shock of the wars, competing visions for what world should be rebuilt, and new computing technologies of the sort that eventually enabled the Anthropocene to be detected by Earth System Scientists, led to a different stance on the future. No longer was time understood as reliably linear or the future as single. Rather, a new profound uncertainty about what could happen led to a sense of the future as an array of multiple possibilities; a maze to be negotiated carefully, not just pursued blindly. Fittingly, the computer power that enabled this new stance on the future was a by-product of the atomic weapons program that led to the dropping of the world\u2018s first atomic bomb, a moment in July 1945 that is now proposed as a suitable Golden Spike for the Great Acceleration phase of the Anthropocene. In 1964, RAND Corporation scientists in the United States used the &#8220;massive data processing and interpreting capability that \u2026 created the breakthrough which led to the development of the atomic bomb&#8221; to produce a &#8220;general theory of prediction&#8221;, the aim of which was to &#8220;enable us to deal with socio-economic and political problems as confidently as we do with problems in physics and chemistry&#8221;. This &#8220;radical shift&#8221; in notions of the future \u2026 became known as \u201cforecasting\u201d\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Forecasting is now ubiquitous, thanks in part to the radical uncertainty that the Anthropocene has ushered in. While consideration of the future is more important than ever, it is prudent to remember that the social origins of our assumptions about the future and the tools we use to perceive it are rooted in the very origins of the Anthropocene. Thus, how suitable they are for helping us understand and navigate the Anthropocene is open to debate. One group that contests the implicit determinism of futurists and their forecasts are futurologists, who argue instead for both a greater degree of openness to unexpected possibilities, and for a commitment to actively and inclusively choosing desirable futures. Many commentators of the Anthropocene similarly call for greater reflexivity about what futures humanity as a whole is now creating, knowingly or not. With the future recast in this way as less a territory to map and claim, and more a path to be carefully and painstakingly created, we may be witnessing yet another stance on the future emerging, one more attuned to the blind spots and responsibilities involved.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":26071,"post_author":"97","post_date":"2020-05-28 13:39:53","post_date_gmt":"2020-05-28 11:39:53","post_content":"","post_title":"Lauren Rickards","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"lauren-rickards","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-05-28 13:39:53","post_modified_gmt":"2020-05-28 11:39:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=26071","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"friederike.becker","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/lauren-rickards\/","acf":{"first_name":"Lauren","last_name":"Rickards"}}],"projects":[{"ID":11633,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2018-11-07 15:45:31","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-07 14:45:31","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">How can the concept of \u201cthe Elemental\u201d inform the ways in which we speak about the Anthropocene?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n  <p>The theme of \u201cthe Elemental\u201d served as the organizing scheme of the <em>Anthropocene Campus Melbourne<\/em> and operated as a reference point for the articulation of genuinely anthropocenic questions and research paths.
