Meskonsing-Kansan is delineated by glacial limits\u2014the limits of the so-called Kansan and late Wisconsinan glaciations\u2014separated by more than 500 miles and 500,000 years.<\/p>\n<p>Meskonsing-Kansan is articulated through a series of treaties, broken and unhonored except for the land cessions. In the wake of the 1832 Black Hawk War, the Ho-Chunk, for example, suffered multiple removals\u2014from Wisconsin to Iowa, to Minnesota, to Dakota Territory, and then to Nebraska. If it can be defined by tracing Indigenous removals and land cessions, Meskonsing-Kansan can also be understood in terms of refusals and returns, particularly among the Ho-Chunk, Meskwaki, Iowa, and Kickapoo Nations. The effects of removals are felt today and every day, and shape what Nick Estes calls \u201cthe Indigenous political practice of return, restoration, and reclamation of belonging and place.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Nick Estes, <em>Our History Is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance, <\/em>New York: Verso, 2019, 248.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Meskonsing-Kansan is composed of hundreds of watersheds above the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers near present-day St. Louis and historic Cahokia. It can be traversed by following these ribbons of water not from source to sea, but from source to source\u2014from the headwaters of the Delaware River, for example, to the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, and then up the Mississippi River to the Wisconsin River, and finally to the headwaters of the Kickapoo River.<\/p>\n<p>Glacial narratives, like glacial erratics, dot the contemporary landscape. Meskonsing-Kansan is shaped and storied by a Glacial Manifest Destiny that pushes preordination, like a stone, back in time\u2014beyond time immemorial into the vast expanse of geologic time or settler deep time. Despite the physical and symbolic violence enacted by these glacial narratives, they are precarious. They have failed to erase other stories\u2014other ways of thinking with the land\u2014and failed to persuade us of their own inevitability. Meskonsing-Kansan makes visible the (colonial) Anthropocene, which is to say it reveals how ongoing processes of colonization are transforming the earth. The (colonial) Anthropocene is everywhere, of course, but it is palpable in places like Iowa Point, Kansas, and Indian Lake, Wisconsin.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":28694,"id":28694,"title":"02_Glacial Rev_Intro","filename":"02_Glacial-Rev_Intro.jpg","filesize":112067,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/02_glacial-rev_intro-2\/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"Image courtesy the authors","caption":"Map of the limits of Kansan and Wisconsinan glaciations, after Aber (1991).","name":"02_glacial-rev_intro-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-09-28 09:47:46","modified":"2020-09-28 09:49:36","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1800,"height":1275,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro-768x544.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":544,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro-300x213.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":213,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro-768x544.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":544,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro-1400x992.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":992,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro-1536x1088.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1088,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro.jpg","2048x2048-width":1800,"2048x2048-height":1275,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/02_Glacial-Rev_Intro-1600x1133.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1133}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>If Meskonsing-Kansan is an attempt to reckon with settler colonization in place, it is marked by our own \u201cgood intentions,\u201d which \u201cpresent a set of deep colonizing (unintended) consequences that obscure ongoing relations of inequity and conquest.&#8221;<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Sarah de Leeuw, Margo Greenwood and Nicole Lindsay, \u201cTroubling good intentions,\u201d <em>Settler Colonial Studies 3<\/em>, no. 3\u20134 (2013), 381\u2013394.<\/span><\/span><\/span> Meskonsing-Kansan is also \u201can epistemological counter-formation, which takes shape in reaction to the lived relations and incommensurable knowledges it seeks to render impossible and inconceivable.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Manu Vimalassery, Juliana Hu Pegues, and Alyosha Goldstein, \u201cColonial Unknowing and Relations of Study,\u201d <em>Theory &amp;
