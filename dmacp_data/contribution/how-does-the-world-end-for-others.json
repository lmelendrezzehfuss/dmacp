the last events of Field Station 4: Confluence Ecologies, we gathered in the late afternoon at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, a point of land called Fort Defiance Park. With the help of many hands, artists Jenny Kendler and Jeremy Bolen launched a ghostly craft made from a pile of ash-white life preservers, its summit providing just enough space for a lounge chair to rest, open for the taking. Tethered to a rope and bobbing on the confluence waters, <em>Lounging through the Flood<\/em> might have been simply an indictment of those\u2014us\u2014who cast themselves as passive witnesses to the deluge. But it was equally a query: Will we, who sit on a cache of life-preserving strategies, get off our elevated roost to actually use them?<\/p>\n<p>But for that moment, witnesses we were, and as we stood assembled at the point, looking over the turbulent waters, we became enmeshed in waves of sound from the inland direction. Machine and insect noises droned together in pulsing hums, a reverie at once alien and familiar. The sweeping mass of sound grew larger and more complex, layering too many elements to identify. A woman\u2019s voice joined the otherwise wordless chorus, reading from a text that, despite the voice\u2019s steady pacing and clarity, was impossible to decipher as a whole. The tone, however, was unmistakable: biblical, incantatory, prophetic, mournful, cautionary.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"embed","title":"","embed":"<iframe title=\"Field Station 4: Performance\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/421537067?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","caption":"Kayla Anderson reads an excerpt from Hermann Broch\u2019s novel The Death of Virgil as part of Brian Kirkbride, Beate Geissler and Oliver Sann\u2019s performance piece \u201cHow Does the World End (For Others?)\u201d"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>We were hearing a sonic composition by Brian Kirkbride, based on a song by the electro pop band the Knife and emanating from speakers mounted on the two-story monument at the center of the park\u2014a ship-like structure with its own elevated prow.
