Out of these direct economic losses, insured losses reached $48 billion.

First, risk is increasing! In the aggregate, actual loss-amounts indicate a global trend towards spiraling disaster costs. Infrastructure damage, crop losses, personal injury, and death: each of these is an area where consumers in every sector feel fear, and this fear motivates the purchase of insurance.<\/p>\n<p>But, there is another, more subtle factor here.

In other words, the desire for insurance is rising, and yet the global-risk system is too complex for the average consumer, or even the average treasury, to understand. Global-disaster anxiety provides the basis for the market. To capitalize, reinsurance keeps one foot in this realm of anxiety, while the other foot leaps boldly ahead into scientific risk avoidance.

This rise is slow but perceptible, occurring at an average rate of about 0.14 inches (3.5 mm) per year since the early 1990s. As sea levels change, some parts of the world will find themselves submerged. Others will acquire new territory as the result of glacial melt, or new oceanfront property as the result of changing sea levels. Populations will move away from submerging markets and toward emerging ones. Anthro-Re offers reinsurance for submerging and emerging markets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>+ Coastal Cities \u2012 Submerging<\/strong><br \/>\nThe first sign of a submerging market is frequent or more intense flooding. In 2008, Venice experienced its worst flood in twenty years, with water nearly waist-deep in St Mark\u2019s Square. With rising temperatures and sea levels and increasing storm intensity it won\u2019t be long until this record is surpassed.<\/p>\n<p>Miami Beach has become notorious for flooding during high tide, even in the absence of storms, and this flooding is only getting worse. Flooding in coastal cities increases risk for residents and industry alike, and the tourist industry stands to be particularly hard hit as many of these cities stand to lose their status as prime vacation spots. Currently, governments are the main providers of flood insurance, as traditionally this area has been seen as too risky for the private insurance market. By offering reinsurance for coastal city flood policies, Anthro-Re seeks to both monetize this growing risk and increase the availability of coverage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>+ Coastal Cities \u2012 Emerging<\/strong><br \/>\nAs sea levels continue to rise, the old coastal cities will submerge and new ones will emerge. For example, when Santa Monica goes under, Pasadena may find itself with a new coastline, and national and local governments and business interests will want to quickly develop and monetize newly created oceanfront properties.<\/p>\n<p>Anthro-Re offers a product to governments in regions that may experience the emergence of new coastal cities. When the time comes, wealthy populations and tourist industries will move from submerging to emerging coastal cities. In other cases, governments will build coastal economies from scratch if the country currently has no coastline. These movements and associated construction will require insurance. The long and uncertain time horizon on sea-level change means that investors could be collecting money on these insurance products for decades before reimbursement becomes a possibility.<\/p>\n<p><strong>+ Immigration Insurance<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile many large coastal cities can be insured against flooding, most small island states cannot, and will soon be underwater. However, Anthro-Re offers a product to insure other governments against the risks and costs of the growing number of climate refugees who it is predicted will seek settlement as their countries are submerged. Europe has already been inundated with refugees from Syria, Eritrea, and elsewhere as the result of ongoing climate-induced warfare. Climate change will only exacerbate this problem as refugees from small island states join the stream of migration, not only to Europe, but also to North America and particularly Australia. Settling refugees is costly and potentially dangerous, yet turning them away is also costly, both financially and politically. With immigration insurance from Anthro-Re, governments can rest assured that when the masses arrive, they will have the resources to deal with them, one way or another.<\/p>\n<p><strong>+ Post-Glacier Settlement<\/strong><br \/>\nAs glaciers melt and global temperatures rise, land currently covered by ice will become available for human settlement, and may prove to be prime farmland as the aridity line moves farther north. Governments will want to be prepared to take advantage of these lands as soon as they come available, both to resettle coastal or refugee populations and to build new agricultural economies as our current agricultural lands become desert. Anthro-Re\u2019s post-glacier settlement product will provide governments with the resources they need to develop these markets as they emerge.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":22284,"id":22284,"title":"Anthropocene Reinsurance Corporation (ANTHRO:RE*)_6","filename":"image6.jpg","filesize":32406,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/anthropocene-reinsurance-corporation-anthrore\/image6\/","alt":"","author":"96","description":"","caption":"","name":"image6","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":22253,"date":"2020-03-26 10:29:44","modified":"2020-03-26 10:30:23","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":610,"height":225,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6.jpg","thumbnail-width":610,"thumbnail-height":225,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6-300x111.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":111,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6.jpg","medium_large-width":610,"medium_large-height":225,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6.jpg","large-width":610,"large-height":225,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6.jpg","1536x1536-width":610,"1536x1536-height":225,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6.jpg","2048x2048-width":610,"2048x2048-height":225,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image6.jpg","feature-width":610,"feature-height":225}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><strong>+ The Drought Opportunity Zone<\/strong><br \/>\nFarmers and pastoralists, especially those engaged in dryland farming and herding, are understandably risk averse.

They bond with them. In the Anthropocene, \u201ccats\u201d are catastrophes and \u201ccat lovers\u201d are reinsurance companies that bond with them through financial instruments called CAT bonds. CAT bonds are a mechanism through which financial markets can provide high returns \u2012 in the order of 9% \u2012 by speculating on large-scale natural catastrophes.<\/p>\n<p>This is becoming big business. In April 2014, Florida\u2019s insurer of last resort issued the largest ever CAT bond for a cool $1.5 billion. In the same year, the African Union issued a $1 billion CAT bond covering climate-related extreme events. In 2013, New York shut the stable door after the proverbial horse had bolted when it issued a $200 million CAT bond following Hurricane Sandy.<\/p>\n<p>So how does a CAT bond work? Imagine you are a large Asian city, let\u2019s say Manila. Let\u2019s say for the fifth year in a row the strongest typhoon in the history of meteorology is about to crush you. In the past, you\u2019d have had to deal with it. Not now. With Anthro-Re, you could issue a CAT bond; let\u2019s say for $1 billion. You sell your bonds up to $1 billion on the international market. Investors can buy the bonds on the promise of a whopping annual return on investment. If the typhoon decides to cruise by Manila, investors cash in. But if the typhoon crashes through Manila, the CAT bond helps deal with the insurance claims (and investors lose).<\/p>\n<p><strong>+ CAT Gambling<\/strong><br \/>\nCAT bonds can be issued for earthquakes, hurricanes, droughts, floods, you name it. They are purchased by pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and wealthy individuals, eager for high returns, and willing to take a chance. We\u2019re looking at you Warren Buffet.<\/p>\n<p>We establish stringent parameters for our CAT bonds. If certain pre-agreed conditions are met, if the typhoon reaches a specific wind speed, if the area affected is specified in the terms of the agreement, if the typhoon hits within the specified period, then an investor loses. If these conditions are not met and the typhoon causes no insurable losses, then the investor wins. The more Anthro-Re knows about the weather (and we know a LOT) the more likely we can offer investors betting opportunities such as these, without Anthro-Re coming up on the wrong side of the catastrophe.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":22286,"id":22286,"title":"Anthropocene Reinsurance Corporation (ANTHRO:RE*)_7","filename":"image7.jpg","filesize":44117,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/anthropocene-reinsurance-corporation-anthrore\/india-floods\/","alt":"","author":"96","description":"Image source: AP","caption":"","name":"india-floods","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":22253,"date":"2020-03-26 10:30:41","modified":"2020-04-07 07:47:22","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":400,"height":295,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7.jpg","thumbnail-width":400,"thumbnail-height":295,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7-300x221.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":221,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7.jpg","medium_large-width":400,"medium_large-height":295,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7.jpg","large-width":400,"large-height":295,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7.jpg","1536x1536-width":400,"1536x1536-height":295,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7.jpg","2048x2048-width":400,"2048x2048-height":295,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7.jpg","feature-width":400,"feature-height":295}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><strong>+ Live CAT Trading<\/strong><br \/>\nWith Anthro-Re, you can now bet on approaching catastrophes \u2012 live!

The field is not an isolated, distinct, stand-alone object, nor is the environment a neutral background on or against which human action takes place. Rather, it is a thick fabric of lateral relations, associations, and chains of actions between material things, large environments, individuals, and collective action. It connects different physical scales and scales of action. Establishing field causalities requires the examination of force fields, causal ecologies, which are non-linear, diffused, simultaneous, and involve multiple agencies and feedback loops. Whereas linear causality entails a focus on the sequences of causal events, field causality involves the spatial arrangement of simultaneous sites, actions, and causes. Field causalities, therefore, is a useful framework for describing forms of violence that are not punctual, but rather that are slow and continuous, without clear beginning or end\u2014those which might be considered to constitute an endless war defined by the permanent clash of multiple forces.
