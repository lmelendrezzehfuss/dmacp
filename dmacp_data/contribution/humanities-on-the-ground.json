Especially in the modern period of dramatic human-environmental change, it distinguishes the Earth as a grand collective project and problematic, so appearing to justify and legitimize a new round of techno-scientific management of the &#8220;Earth System&#8221;. At the same time, the &#8220;environmental crisis&#8221; has also been called a crisis of culture, and thus of imagination. In this sense, it begs the attention of the humanities, which have always been concerned with the human experience, even as it challenges their underlying assumptions and practices.<\/p>\n<p>This symposium engages the tripartite challenge facing humanities scholarship today: the need to expand beyond Western narrative\/disciplinary super-structures\u2014in which human separation from nature is a fundamental component\u2014and to simultaneously address &#8220;alternative&#8221; subjects and societal experience and the role of environment and nature itself as constituent element in this experience.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense the Anthropocene concept\u2014useful now as it encapsulates in a single word the grand theoretical tradition that has so defined Western understandings of modernity and nature itself\u2014must be taken down to the ground, to the lived experience that composes the long cultural-ecological histories of Asia. The Anthropocene therefore presents an epistemological problem that, if taken seriously, is also ultimately an ontological opportunity. The question of the knowledge that is considered legitimate and relevant now as human societies face rapid social-ecological change is linked so closely to particular cultural understandings of the agencies that constitute the known world. How to see such knowledge, cultures and ecologies in themselves as agents that indeed have also created the Earth?<\/p>\n<p>This symposium asks humanities and interdisciplinary scholars how to re-conceptualize the significance of the humanities now, in light of the history and modern day contexts of Asia, in which humankind\u2019s inevitable experience has formed part of an always dynamic, yet changeable nature.<\/p>\n<p>Further information at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chikyu.ac.jp\/rihn_e\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chikyu.ac<\/a><\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":false,"projects":[{"ID":4965,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2017-01-01 15:01:50","post_date_gmt":"2017-01-01 14:01:50","post_content":"<p>Conceptual, material, and immaterial cultural forms through which environmental knowledge has been recognized, organized, activated, and transmitted in East Asia.<\/p>\n The Concept of the Anthropocene in the East Asian Context <p><em>Where<\/em> is the Anthropocene? If seen from a corner of the East Asian Continent\/Peninsula\/Archipelago, does the same image come into focus as seen from other parts of the world? Although the notion of the Anthropocene points to humanity\u2019s involvement in Earth history, especially in light of contemporary global environmental change, the very same planet is comprised of individual ecological niches and diverse cultures existing within particular milieu. So we might also ask: Who is this <em>humanity<\/em>?<\/p>\n<p>Collaborating with both Japanese and European museums and their associated communities, the aim of the project is to design a sequence of events to explore the conceptual, material, and immaterial cultural forms through which environmental knowledge has historically been recognized, organized, activated, and transmitted in East Asia by way of conferences, public events, and publications.<\/p>\n <p>Project activities are emerging in the following domains:<\/p>\n<h1>Language<\/h1>\n<p>One of the characteristics of East Asian language is the widespread use of the sinograph which has been the lingua franca of this region&#8212;like Latin was in Europe&#8212;for more than a millennium. It still has huge influence on the way of thinking for nations in this area. How can the term Anthropocene be translated into languages in this Sinographic sphere (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese\u2026)? A definitive translation of the term does not exist yet and there are numerous possibilities; \u4eba\u65b0\u4e16(ren-xin-shi [cn] \/ in-shin-se [kr]\/ jin-shin-sei [jp]\/ human-new-era [en]),\u3000\u4eba\u9593\u4e16(ren-jian-shi [cn] \/ in-gan-se [kr]\/ nin-gen-sei [jp]\/ humanity-era [en]),\u4eba\u4f7f\u671f(ren-shi-ji [cn]\/ in-sa-gi [kr]\/ jin-si-ki [jp]\/ human-usage-period [en]), \u4eba\u9020\u65f6(ren-zao-shi [cn]\/in-jo-si [kr]\/ jin-zou-ji [jp]\/ human-made-time [en])? The problem of translation is the problem of a gap in perception. How are humanity, its agency, and its temporality &#8212; as contained in the term \u201cAnthropocene\u201d &#8212; translated into another language which has its own context? Is the translated word equivalent to the very concept of the Anthropocene itself? It might make us think of the possibility (and impossibility) of thinking the Anthropocene in a truly global perspective.<\/p>\n<h1>Knowledge Praxis<\/h1>\n<p>Related to the problem of language, the tendency toward \u201cformal knowledge\u201d is also problematized in the East Asian context. The history of modernization in this region is a history of struggle with new notions coming from the Western world in waves, one after another, over the last two centuries. Translation played an enormously important role in this process: the crucial task for intellectuals in that period was to express new foreign ideas in sinographs, and so to create new words.<\/p>\n<p>When the Anthropocene is argued in the East Asian context, does it not follow the same trace? Or can another mode of learning and discourse exist? How is knowledge beyond the history and yoke of the nation-state possible? In Tokyo, one of the historical windows into the modern world of East Asia, discussions dealing with the problem of learning in the Anthropocene are already being activated.<\/p>\n<h1>Long Dur\u00e9e of Patterns in Materiality<\/h1>\n<p>What is materiality in the era of the Anthropocene? East Asia is a region of rich material culture traditions, some still living today even after the long succession of more than ten thousand years; some even preceding the dawn of the Holocene. Such continuities speak to deep flows of human experience conveyed from past to present. In this context, we think about materiality not only as material in the literal sense, but as also including \u201cinvisible\u201d vehicles of culture such as social institutions, language, and landscapes.<\/p>\n<p>Collaborating with both Japanese and European museums and their associated communities, RIHN is planning a series of workshops to explore relationships between environment and humanity from this long dur\u00e9e and environmental perspective, with special emphasis on the experience of artists, craftspersons, and others whose knowledge is embedded in the material world. In total, these activities point to an interactive experience at the 2019 HKW Anthropocene campus signaling the continuing ubiquity and significance of such place-based and shared experience even in the midst of the Technosphere.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","post_title":"Anthropocene East
