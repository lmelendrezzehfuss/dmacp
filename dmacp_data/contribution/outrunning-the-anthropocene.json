These are lessons that frontline communities like the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe can already share, and which can help us reimagine a different politics of coastal protection and restoration for the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3105,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:17","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:17","post_content":"","post_title":"Ian Gray","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"ian-gray","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-03 10:32:09","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-03 09:32:09","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/ian-gray\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/ian-gray\/","acf":{"first_name":"Ian Patrick","last_name":"Gray"}}],"projects":[{"ID":3488,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-22 11:26:24","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-22 09:26:24","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">Green infrastructures intend to respond to the climatic and environmental challenges of the Anthropocene.
