As historians, we tried to replicate this methodology within the framework of historical contextualism. We brought Peter Schlemihl from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first century in order to see the Westhafen world of 2016 \u201cthrough the eyes of a past actor\u201d\u2014that is, in Schlemihl\u2019s case, through the eyes of an expert naturalist who loved to observe, collect, and classify unknown species. By forcing the unknown \u201cspecies\u201d\u2014cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, plastic bags, waste, metal and stone animals, and so on\u2014into his nineteenth-century natural categories, Schlemihl identifies artifacts as natural beings (plants or animals).<\/p>\n<p>From the perspective of someone living in the twenty-first century, Schlemihl erases the boundaries between the natural and the artificial world. The new meanings he attributes to nature deeply invoke the anthropocenic blurring of the dichotomy between nature, artificial\/nature and culture by questioning what is really natural in a world deeply (re)shaped by humankind, and simultaneously by naturalizing technology; in the process he endows its artifacts with a natural character. If we go a step further, we realize that not only do we see technology as natural, but we expect nature to behave as a technological artifact. A fitting example is the small child who plays with a tablet, dragging fishes with her finger. When confronted with fishes in an aquarium, she reproduces her finger\u2019s movements in order to control the movement of actual fishes, becoming surprised by her failure.<\/p>\n<p>In our seminar \u201cRomancing the Anthropocene,\u201d the concept of shadow acted as a quasi-object in Michel Serres\u2019 sense, as it forced us to adapt our own perspective on what we considered the \u201ccorrect\u201d approach to the Anthropocene, in a dynamic interaction where the shadow was used by us, but also \u201cused\u201d us. Thus, by being both object and subject, it strongly bordered Bruno Latour\u2019s concept of objects as \u201cactants.\u201d We hope to continue to develop this line of \u201calternative\u201d ontologies to discuss deeply and widely the relationship between the Anthropocene and the social sciences, particularly the history of science and technology.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3204,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:24","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:24","post_content":"","post_title":"Maria Paula Diogo","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"maria-paula-diogo","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:50:13","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:50:13","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/maria-paula-diogo\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/maria-paula-diogo\/","acf":{"first_name":"Maria Paula ","last_name":"Diogo"}},{"ID":2949,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:03","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:03","post_content":"","post_title":"Ana Sim\u00f5es","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"ana-simoes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:32:13","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:32:13","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/ana-simoes\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/ana-simoes\/","acf":{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"Sim\u00f5es"}}],"projects":[{"ID":19740,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2016-04-23 14:02:31","post_date_gmt":"2016-04-23 12:02:31","post_content":"<p>Tracing shadows\u2014an examination of technological datasets and Romantic concepts in the study area of Berlin-Moabit.<\/p>\n Urban Diffractions of the Technosphere <p>Tracing shadows\u2014an examination of technological datasets and Romantic concepts in the study area of Berlin-Moabit.<\/p>\n <p>The seminar begins with the curious tale of Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man, as a trope for contemporary urban diffractions of the Technosphere. Written in 1814 by the Berlin\u2010based botanist and Romantic novelist, Adelbert von Chamisso, the tale of the shadowless man casts a critical light on issues of capitalism, mobility, scientific advancement, social responsibility, and statelessness and immigration\u2014then as now. As the story goes, the hero trades his shadow, and thus his existence and identity, to the devil for limitless wealth; only to be shunned by society. After a period of inevitable philanthropy, he trades in his riches for a pair of magical, seven\u2010league boots, with which he travels the world in search of peace before finally finding solace in the study of earth sciences.<\/p>\n<p>The first part of the seminar unpacks the legacy of the shadowless man in the context of Berlin as a hub for multiple Technospheres. Schlemihl\u2019s (i.e. Chamisso\u2019s) scientific ambitions can be traced in the Berlin Digital Environmental Atlas, a comprehensive dataset documenting almost every possible aspect of the city\u2019s natural and built environment, from breeding bird populations and rare flowers, to carbon dioxide emissions, population density, and environmental justice. This wealth of knowledge stands in sharp contrast to the complicity of a political elite who have sold the city\u2019s public lands to devilish investors in the face of climate change, demographic upheaval, and the wanderings of tens of thousands of displaced individuals who, like Chamisso\u2019s hero, possess nothing more than their shadows, but bring new forms of knowledge to an already complex repository.<\/p>\n<p>The second part will embark on a collective field exercise through the Westhafen area of Berlin-Moabit to explore the potential dialogue\u2014or divergence\u2014between quantitative data, personal narrative, and changing imagery. Using methods of participatory observation, a form of anthropological \u201cshadowing,\u201d ecological site surveys, creative cartography, artistic invention, and radical story-telling participants track down evidence of industrial infrastructures and biological niches, local perceptions and everyday visions, and the paths and patterns of resources being shipped, stored, sold, or wasted. Literary moments from the Schlemihl story and key concepts of Romanticism, such as mystery, spontaneity, horror, and the sublime (concepts that appeared as revolutionary counterpoints to the scientific rationalization of nature in the nineteenth century), are applied to the overly quantified contemporary city. Amidst a sea of data, new romantic protagonists develop alternative narratives of the city.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Romancing the
