photo is of an object, a sculpture titled\u00a0<em>Cadillac Ranch<\/em>, created by a group of young architects\/artists named Ant Farm. I was a member of the group and supervised the installation in June 1974.<\/p>\n<p>The photo was taken at a party to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of\u00a0<em>Cadillac Ranch<\/em>. It is late afternoon on June 21, 2004, the Summer Solstice. It is a social gathering reflecting Anthropos\u2019 desire to commemorate and mark time passing. Twelve Anthropos can be seen in the photo. The location is a wheat field just west of Amarillo, Texas, alongside Interstate 40, but set back 150 meters from the highway. The site could be the geographic center of the North American continent: latitude 35.18724, longitude 101.9869.<\/p>\n<p>The nonhuman is represented by the ten cars which have been stripped of their functional mobility and transformed into art objects, frozen in place, inserted into the ground, and lined up as an evolutionary diagram\u2014the rise and fall of the tail fin, 1948\u201364. The automobile, an \u201cextension of man\u201d as Marshal McLuhan said, perhaps has been the most powerful shaping force in transforming the surface of the planet during the twentieth century, at least on this continent. The Cadillac was the top of the General Motors product line and considered \u201cthe Standard of the World\u201d during the 1950s. The 1959 Cadillac sports the largest tail fins, possibly representing a pinnacle of the automotive bell curve.<\/p>\n<p>Several \u201cTimes\u2014Before and After\u201d are represented here: times before and after the tail fin; the time before the peak of the automotive bell curve, which stretches back to the late nineteenth century, and the time after, an unknown future of changing technologies of mobility; the time before and after the transition of photography to a digital medium. The vertical line in the photo marks it as an artifact of pre-digital photography, because this panoramic view was made by combining two drugstore prints. The line also divides the 1956 Cadillac and the 1957. Two additional cars are not visible to the left. Dark clouds on the horizon portend severe weather, and, in fact, the party ended when rain, along with hail the size of tennis balls, fell from the sky.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3010,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:08","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:08","post_content":"","post_title":"Chip Lord","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"chip-lord","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:19:16","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:19:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/chip-lord\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/chip-lord\/","acf":{"first_name":"Chip","last_name":"Lord"}}],"projects":[{"ID":20733,"post_author":"11","post_date":"2014-11-23 16:57:12","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 15:57:12","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene remains peculiarly flat and colorless when it comes to concrete images, which are lacking cultural nuance and historical depth.

New imaginaries and imaginations are needed to engage with alternative futures of infrastructure and anthropogenically altered landscapes.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of the Anthropocene has resonated in Western cultures since at least the nineteenth century. Today it presents itself in scientific images as planetary boundaries and limits to growth, as an age when human interventions on the planet call for a great transformation. But in a much wider sense, transformation, utopia, collapse and ambition, reflection and bewilderment have long been topics of human relationships with the landscape, large and small. This can be seen in works of art as well as in science: images of landscapes, or indeed the entire Earth, express topics of metamorphosis, of power, economy, security, and appropriation. They also express fantasies about the wild, the other\u2014and about possible alternatives to present-day ways of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of the seminar was to explore existing images of the Earth and the Anthropocene, and to extend the scope further to include imaginaries of alternative futures. Participants engaged with ways in which a transformed, warmer, less stable, highly utilized world might see changes in social patterns, ways of life, and culture that go much deeper than what is commonly discussed. Exploratory, imaginary engagement with anthropogenically altered landscapes in a possible future presented sharp new perspectives on the Anthropocene and its implications in areas such as architecture and art.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Imaging the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-14 18:23:57","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-14 16:23:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20733","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":23593,"id":23593,"title":"HKW_Imaging the Anthropocene","filename":"HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","filesize":327981,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-imaging-the-anthropocene\/hkw_maging-the-anthropocene\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_maging-the-anthropocene","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20733,"date":"2020-04-02 15:55:34","modified":"2020-04-02 15:57:00","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1589,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-768x477.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":477,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-300x186.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":186,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-768x477.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":477,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1400x869.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":869,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1536x953.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":953,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-scaled.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1271,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_maging-the-Anthropocene-1600x993.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":993}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthropocene remains peculiarly flat and colorless when it comes to concrete images, which are lacking cultural nuance and historical depth.
