According to Peter Haff, the spatial manifestation of the Anthropocene is the emergence of a new geosphere \u2013 the technosphere. The concept of the technosphere highlights the systemic quality of large-scale transformation of the Earth surface by human beings and their technological tools.

Artificial satellites constitute a spatially remote and historically novel layer in orbit around the Earth.

In addition, although ownership can be traced to the specific actors, other aspects of satellite infrastructure\u2014such as debris generated through launch, operation, and disposal, or the distribution trajectories of their functional materials\u2014are difficult to assign to specific nations or companies.

From a perspective informed by an understanding of \u201cfield causalities,\u201d the analysis of armed conflict can no longer conform to the model of criminal law that seeks to trace a direct line between the two-limit figures of victim and perpetrator, or between the two ends of a smoking gun. The field is not an isolated, distinct, stand-alone object, nor is the environment a neutral background on or against which human action takes place. Rather, it is a thick fabric of lateral relations, associations, and chains of actions between material things, large environments, individuals, and collective action. It connects different physical scales and scales of action. Establishing field causalities requires the examination of force fields, causal ecologies, which are non-linear, diffused, simultaneous, and involve multiple agencies and feedback loops. Whereas linear causality entails a focus on the sequences of causal events, field causality involves the spatial arrangement of simultaneous sites, actions, and causes. Field causalities, therefore, is a useful framework for describing forms of violence that are not punctual, but rather that are slow and continuous, without clear beginning or end\u2014those which might be considered to constitute an endless war defined by the permanent clash of multiple forces.
