By framing the narrative account of our own culture in the nonhuman context of geological deep time we are subsumed: just another fleeting time-being within the expanse of nature\u2019s exceeding history.

This is not only by virtue of that past\u2019s vast and inhuman scales, but also for the sobering tale it tells about the fate that befalls so many species confronted with abrupt environmental change. In that light, starting this paragraph with \u201cat the same time\u201d shifts from an incidental phrasing into the core question that the Anthropocene designation poses: Can the time of \u201cnature\u201d and the time of \u201cculture\u201d now be embraced as one in the <em>same time<\/em>?
