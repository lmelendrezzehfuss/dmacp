It\u2019s not just the light greens, oranges, yellows, pinks, and reds intersecting and swirling across the page, or the interplay of curves tracing the meanders of the river against the underlying cartographic grid; the real power of these drawings, I believe, is in their fantastical nature. They speak to an unimaginable world in which a river runs rampant, sweeping to and fro across the landscape, riverbanks and watercourse shifting by miles even within the lifespan of a single human.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, the ways in which we represent and think about the landscape today are rooted in stability, even though it is clear that large-scale shifts in landscapes are well upon us\u2014in the form of rising seas and sinking marshlands, retreating glaciers and melting ice sheets, cataclysmic floods, wildfires obliterating entire towns, and climbing temperatures redefining climate regions and entire ecosystems. We understand the places we inhabit to be fixed in place, findable via GPS coordinates.<\/p>\n<p>Our infrastructural systems and our political discourse, even as we speak of retreat and \u201cclimate refugees,\u201d cannot countenance truly dynamic conditions. In the Mississippi River Valley and the Mississippi River Delta, the latter being the context of the River Campus seminar \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/anthropocene-river-campus-the-human-delta\/seminar-un-bounded-engineering-and-evolutionary-stability\">Un\/bounded Engineering and Evolutionary Stability<\/a>\u201d was engaged with, fixity drives policy and practice. We build and reinforce levees to keep the river from overflowing or breaking through its banks. We dredge the river bottom to maintain shipping channels. We build water intakes and sewage outflows for neighboring communities that are predicated upon the river staying where it is. If the river changes course, our communities would suffer, and our very state lines would change. We can scarcely imagine what we see in the Fisk maps: an environment in which the river regularly jumps its banks, and where human settlements change with the seasons and with the varying flow of water and sediment.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":27727,"id":27727,"title":"Diagram1","filename":"Diagram1-scaled.jpg","filesize":231696,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram1-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/diagram1\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Image

What would allow us to engage Nikiwe\u2019s introduction of multi-species ethnography alongside an exploration\u00a0of\u00a0microbes, algae, insects, and plants with Jelagat?

We asked: how can drawing support different modes of exploration and learning? How can drawing enrich dialogue and support multi-disciplinary practice? And how can drawing support the imagining of new futures for the Mississippi?<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of the seminar, we used drawings to tell each other about ourselves, to collect spatial data, to trace ecological relationships, to express questions and concerns, to make connections, and to envision new delta landscapes. Participants created drawings during every phase, as described in the following collection of texts and images. Using pen, markers, tape, copier paper, large rolls of paper, and artifacts collected at the riverfront, we created hundreds of drawings over the course of three days.<\/p>\n<p>Importantly, we also came up against the limits and fallibility of drawing, including how a strict emphasis on drawing lifts up some voices and forms of knowledge, while marginalizing other forms of knowledge and cultural practices (e.g., oral traditions). And also how the representation of environments and systems as lines, dashes, patterns, and colors too often elides human histories of racialized control, colonization, enslavement, displacement, and ongoing environmental injustice in the service of a false objectivity.<\/p>\n<h1>Day 1: Introductions, flow, and the levee<\/h1>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":27728,"id":27728,"title":"Diagram2","filename":"Diagram2-scaled.jpg","filesize":225367,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/diagram2\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Image by Aron Chang","caption":"","name":"diagram2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-08-04 14:22:23","modified":"2020-08-04 15:01:18","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1536,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-768x461.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":461,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-300x180.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":180,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-768x461.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":461,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-1400x840.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":840,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-1536x922.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":922,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-2048x1229.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1229,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram2-1600x960.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":960}},{"ID":27632,"id":27632,"title":"2. day1IMG_1695","filename":"2.-day1IMG_1695-scaled.jpg","filesize":470419,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/2-day1img_1695\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Photo by Chris Daemmrich","caption":"Participants introduce themselves to one another through drawings.","name":"2-day1img_1695","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-08-03 14:38:43","modified":"2020-08-03 14:42:23","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1707,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-1536x1024.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-2048x1365.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.-day1IMG_1695-1600x1067.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}},{"ID":27633,"id":27633,"title":"3. day1IMG_1708 -

Our interest is in the ways in which engineered forms both restrict and permit flow, and in examining relationships along and across the boundary formed by river levees and the spillway structure. We continue to draw using clipboards and markers, but also bring with us jars and bags in which to collect artifacts for the next day\u2019s drawings.<\/p>\n<p>On the way to and from the Spillway, Greta Gladney asks us to consider her family\u2019s long history living alongside the river and in the delta, both in St. Charles Parish and in New Orleans\u2019s Lower Ninth Ward. River floods and hurricanes in conjunction with public policies and practices for river control and hurricane protection have displaced her family multiple times in just the past century. Today, a proposal to expand the lock structure where the Industrial Canal draws ships from the Mississippi once again threatens to displace many of the Lower Ninth Ward\u2019s residents.<\/p>\n<p>Back from the Spillway visit at Tulane, one group sorts and analyzes the biological samples we\u2019ve collected while another group learns about the history of technologies used for river control as understood through patent applications. Tanya James challenges those of us working as designers, planners, engineers, and scientists to rethink how we do our work to address the racial inequality, injustices, and violence embodied in present day infrastructures and their histories. For example, how do we think about, represent, and talk about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologystories.org\/levees-slavery-and-maintenance\/\">Mississippi River levees<\/a> and their future if we understand that these levees were built up by enslaved people to protect the plantations and colonial society that held these people in bondage? And that those same levees now protect the chemical plants and refineries that poison the air and water of African American communities founded by the descendants of those enslaved people?<\/p>\n<p>The two groups come back together, and discussion coalesces around taking the notion of <em>speculation <\/em>that had been central to the seminar at the start, and using speculation to try to ask and answer questions about <em>how <\/em>we do our work. To close out the day, we ask participants to use cards to record their thoughts, questions, and concerns heading into the last day of the seminar.<\/p>\n<h2>Day 3: Scale, negotiation, and possible futures<\/h2>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"carousel","image":[{"ID":27730,"id":27730,"title":"Diagram4","filename":"Diagram4-scaled.jpg","filesize":310114,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-scaled.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/diagram4\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"Image by Aron Chang","caption":"","name":"diagram4","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-08-04 14:22:42","modified":"2020-08-04 15:01:21","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2560,"height":1536,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-768x461.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":461,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-300x180.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":180,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-768x461.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":461,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-1400x840.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":840,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-1536x922.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":922,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-2048x1229.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1229,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Diagram4-1600x960.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":960}},{"ID":27640,"id":27640,"title":"10. day3IMG_1996 -

Dialog, questioning, and ideation become tangible through the arranging of artifacts and through markmaking. Working together in this way requires coming to agreement on structure and principles, form and technique. How will we use this big sheet of paper? What is top, what is bottom? How do we reinterpret materials, draw connections, or add new ideas?<\/p>\n<p>In the first activity, all participants array drawings, artifacts, biological samples, and other materials from Days 1 and 2 on giant piece of paper to articulate relationships between different phenomena, scales, and systems.<\/p>\n<p>To wrap up, we organize ourselves around sets of ideas that are visible on the BIG drawing, and work in smaller groups to create <strong>new drawings representing possible futures <\/strong>for the river and the delta. With less than an hour to create our drawings, we use materials already at hand. We seek to communicate underlying principles and organizational structures rather than attempting to imagine what each possible future will look like. We tear open plastic cups and use wedges of plastic to represent extraction and toxicity as well as the arpent lines of plantations. We simulate a healthy wetland environment using paper, tape, and plants collected at the Spillway. We use tape to literally create a mesh network with no beginning and with no end.<\/p>\n<p>Each of the drawings and visual artifacts we create is a drawing \u201cof\u201d something rather than \u201cabout\u201d something. If you tug on the web of blue tape one group creates, for example, every other part of the network moves too. The drawing embodies the principles of interconnectedness and mutual dependency we are seeking to represent. The forested wetland another group creates is a model of a new kind of ecosystem where humans are not the prime actors\u2014the three-dimensional drawing contains within it the very sediments and seeds that would be necessary to seed such an ecosystem. And we discover new organizational and representational possibilities along the way. The segments of blue tape used to bind plants to paper form their own pattern, offering additional representational opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Aesthetically, these drawings are unruly, even ugly. They exist not as an articulation of a singular vision, but as the product of negotiation and improvisation by many\u2014groups of artists, biologists, anthropologists, landscape architects, social workers, geologists, filmmakers, and teachers still getting to know each other, each with a hand in creation and none with ultimate control. It is perhaps more apt to think about these drawings in terms of world building, which is why the co-creation of these drawings\u2014describing worlds as radical as the one seen in the Fisk maps from 1944\u2014suggests exciting possibilities for multi-disciplinary, creative work in a time of crisis and conflict.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p>Drawing as an exploratory, co-creative process is one way can come together to share different forms of knowledge and to develop and communicate ideas formed out of diverse perspectives. With limited time and limited materials, we end up relying on observation and listening, synchronizing the imaginations and hands of many co-creators, and the serendipity of materials. The process of making each drawing relies on our ability to build trust and understanding between co-creators and to find ways to work together. It asks us to engage both the physical properties and the symbolic value of tape, water, plant cuttings, mold, paper, cardboard, plastic, tar balls, words, and markings. With these humble materials, we can help each other draw connections between local conditions and global trade. We can make tangible interdependencies between our respective forms of knowledge, between humans and other species, and between the our past, present, and future. And we can both make visible and reimagine our own disciplinary practices even as we reimagine the myriad flows of water, soils, life, capital, and toxins that shape our existence, often through, over, under, and around the hard lines we\u2019ve drawn in the landscape in order to control the Mississippi and its delta.<\/p>\n<p>These are the very skills and practices that we will need to fashion more just futures for ourselves and the ecosystems we inhabit as we look to transform watersheds, rivers, deltas, and infrastructural systems in the face of climate change, sinking coastlines, environmental pollution, and centuries of environmental injustice.<\/p>\n<h2>Participants&#8217; field

toward human aims and the consequences this has on multiple scales is the key concern of this seminar.<\/p>\n  <p>Human interventions into alluvial flow patterns change the form and path of rivers across the world. This seminar examines the role of engineering river systems toward human aims and the consequences this has on interdependent metabolisms at multiple scales, between the watershed, the city, and the microbe\/organism.<\/p>\n <p>The Mississippi River Delta is a poster child for the effects of\u00a0<em>path dependency<\/em>. Its current geologic form is roughly 7000 years old, a direct result of the fan-like motion of alluvial deposits as the river changes course approximately every 1000 years. While this trajectory\u2014or necessary path\u2014constitutes the general topology of river-dominated deltas, the Mississippi River Delta stands out as both an emblematic and unique expression of how these alluvial formations come to pass. This is in part due to hydrological regulations mandated by the U.S. Congress, which have turned the river into a highly engineered conduit for drainage and navigation. This political decision to maintain the current path of the river by the \u201clevees only policy\u201d attempts to legislate the persistence of the \u201cThird Coast\u201d: the Port of Louisiana including the cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Since these ideas took hold in 1963, a complex of structures known as <em>Old River Control<\/em> has set the flow of water between the Mississippi and the Atchafalaya, overriding the Mississippi\u2019s intrinsic geomorphological trajectory. For this reason, the Mississippi River has turned from a vivid example of sublime nature exceeding human comprehension and influence, to the contemporary\u00a0<em>sublime\u00a0<\/em>and awe towards modern regulatory regimes and the incomprehensible accounts of loss should those regimes fail. How long can this societal path dependency endure, imposing control and order over the river&#8217;s trajectory, which eventually has to change course again?<\/p>\n<p>This seminar explores different implications of these alluvial pathways and their relationship to the hydrological engineering that orients it today, by visiting the Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway and the New Orleans Carrollton Water Purification Plant. The Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway is an ideal site for understanding the relationship between engineered and naturally occurring flows because it is designed to mimic the principle of episodic breaches by creating a site for such a breach to occur, in a controlled, mechanized fashion. As infrastructure, it rests between natural and engineered operations. Carrollton Water Plant supports deeper understanding of path dependency at the scale of cities and urban systems. It is a site that uses multi-stage engineering to draw from the Mississippi and create potable water for the city. Its importance and vulnerability, however, demonstrate the need to rethink how this infrastructure operates.<\/p>\n<p>Using a multi-scalar approach\u2014with the flow of water and pollutants as connecting threads\u2014participants will investigate metabolisms at three different scales (species, urban, deltaic). Participants will collect samples, study various components of riverine infrastructure, create collective maps and sectional drawings, and explore the dynamic relationship engineering and ecology have with path dependency. Participants will work directly with experts with backgrounds in water management, planning and design, social work, and coastal sciences to orient additional readings of the sites with concern to public access to clean water. Drawing on their experiences in the field, participants will develop possible scenarios imagining a \u201cradical\u201d shift in the river course and its relationship to the New Orleans area.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Un\/bounded Engineering and Evolutionary
