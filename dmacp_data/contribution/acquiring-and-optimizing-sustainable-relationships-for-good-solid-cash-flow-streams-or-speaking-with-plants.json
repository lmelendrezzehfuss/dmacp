The first gesture indicates meaning. The first word indicates intention. Language is a point of departure for the values we hold. Does a language have a beginning and end, like those we assign to a river? The mouth of this \u201criver\u201d is where we approach language, but, like the unclear headwaters, the story begins much earlier.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A river begins inside of the heart of a mountain\u2014inside the moan of thunder\u2014spun from headwaters, an almost-silent pond spiraling with a whispering thread of water disappearing into the forest to flow and flow and flow. The song of a whale echoes through ocean waters\u2014that were indeed once the beginning of rivers\u2014anthems of aliveness and companions to those like the salmon who return to their natal waters, traveling upstream, their memory feasts digested inside the bellies of some of the ancient swimming makers of milk. A river begins on the edges of stories. We travel to the depths of the beginnings of the river when we ask our grandmothers to share something from their childhood. A river begins inside the grief of forgetting. A river begins in the fingertips of a weaver.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maureen Walrath<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Language of Responsible Care\u2122<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is through the remoteness of words that so many of us manifest our relationships to place\u2014conjuring the significance of an environment through borrowed assumptions, locating ourselves within some predetermined coordinates, inhabiting a place only after we have already decided on its limits. We are obedient to politicized terminologies, vocabularies shaped by curricula that are afforded to the few, ephemeral hashtags that accumulate social capital. If so much of our experience and sense of responsibility toward land is shaped by the most profitable of words, what do we find behind these terms?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Landscapes are deeply personal. I find that there is great incongruence between how fast technologies change landscapes and how slow we are to culturally absorb or adopt to those changes. Our identities are often connected to a very static rendering of a place\u2014we often haven\u2019t seen what it was before \u201cus,\u201d or what it might be. That limited vision often means we fear landscape change because we fear losing that which defines us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Roopali Phadke<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@bgonzal1_73646\/line-3-debate-and-the-anthropocene-d8ce856487a2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Line 3 Debate and the Anthropocene<\/em><\/a>\u00a0is an essay by Bianca Acevedo Gonzalez, shared in John Kim\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/anthropocene-and-the-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Anthropocene and the Media<\/em>\u00a0<\/a>seminar.

The agency we have to take what we need from it for monetary profit\u2014where development is permitted because it promises capital gains, and value is immediate. In this imagining, there is no such thing as\u00a0<em>free<\/em>\u00a0space\u2014you might even say there are no more landscapes. Every place is limited by borders and a specific use; privatized, exploited for its potential value, and in this way imprisoned within itself.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are the teachings of elders. The requirements of wild rice. The beauty of places associated with human spirituality and ritual, or tended to by non-human beings. The imagining of a time far beyond the present moment. The respect given to a place that can exist only for itself.<\/p>\n<p>The justification of these qualities is challenging for legal systems that demand a linear message of growth, development, capital. The seductive term of progress is defined by return-on-investment, by the ability of companies to perpetuate their own businesses. What other effects does this numbing have on us?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The best developments are community driven processes. The challenge is time and patience. Community processes are slow and often circuitous. Developers are challenged to respond to many and competing voices, and lean on committees and officials to mediate. The other challenge is the investment landscape, which privileges placeless development and quick turn-around times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Roopali Phadke<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Placeless development leaves us with locations determined by the value we find in them\u2014speculative value, mineral deposits, strategic territory design. Our plans and maps are not illustrations of emotional networks, but deeply divisive contracts of ownership over resources.<\/p>\n<p>Gonzalez focuses on Enbridge and the specific issue of the Line 3 project in Minnesota, but such branding that centers on sustainability through the lens of \u201cEconomic Benefits\u201d is widely adopted by oil and gas companies, mining giants, and chemical conglomerates to justify their projects. Defining sustainability ultimately means owning the words to shape this definition. These proprietary definitions can then be used to create smokescreens around corporate strategy as, for example, with the Canadian-initiated Responsible Care\u2122 \u201cglobal product strategy\u201d that was adopted in 1985 by the International Council of Chemical Associations.<\/p>\n<p>The Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC)\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/canadianchemistry.ca\/responsible-care\/about-responsible-care\/the-ethic-principles-of-sustainability-for-responsible-care\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">describes this Ethic<\/a>: \u201cThrough Responsible Care\u00ae, CIAC member-companies strive to &#8216;do the right thing and be seen to do the right thing&#8217;.\u201d Such value statements are frequently trademarked. A marketing sleight of hand, a slogan for charitable programs, awards, and children\u2019s educational activities on Earth Day, or World Water Day. Today\u2019s crisis is tomorrow\u2019s woke image management campaign.<\/p>\n<p>A curious glance at what\u2019s trending for\u00a0#sustainability\u00a0on Twitter yields a number of companies using the \u201cfindability\u201d of the word to position themselves as thought-leaders and drive traffic to their content. Zurich Insurance introduces carbon-emissions measures for its offices. A Brand Contributor for Bayer writes a think-piece on \u201csustainable agriculture\u201d for\u00a0<em>Forbes<\/em>\u2019 BRANDVOICE Paid Program. A bottled water company is promoted on finance.yahoo for using aluminum \u201ccustom branded bottles\u201d in which to sell its premium water.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This will be a battle of vision. There are many who are quite happy with the status quo and the way they know and enjoy the river. Change is both frightening and seems unnecessary. It\u2019s hard to imagine returning the river to a pre-industrial path. Yet, for many in our communities, especially for native peoples, the built river today is an embodiment of a settler colonial vision that is full of pain.

Each time I weave I feel I am being asked to change form, grow more courageous, emulate the strength and resilience of the willow. The weaving is a prayer for the wildly complex world we are part of.

We can learn from our ancestors, the ways they formed relationship with materials and resources, and the way they related to the rhythms, patterns, and wisdom of the earth.

How do we rebuild relationships with something that we are actively disappearing? What part of ourselves do we give back to the land?

How to be in place, part of a place, to be a place?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been asking, what does it mean to be fully alive in a place, to move with and learn from the rhythms of the seasons among and with other humans, and within the lives of all beings. In A Wizard of Earthsea, Ursula K. Le Guin speaks to the intimate relationship with plants, fictional or not: \u2018When you know the fourfoil in all its seasons root and leaf and flower, by sight and scent and seed, then you may learn its true name, knowing its being: which is more than its use.\u2019 Being in a place means learning its true name. Being in a place means listening to the language that has been there and is there\u2014human and non-human. Learn the names of the rivers and creeks, and the names they had before those names. To be in a place is to be a part of the body of a place; slow down and quiet long enough to form a relationship with fully embodied sensual awareness. As a human, to be in a place means we can listen for what is needed and respond\u2014whether in song, stillness, planting seeds, cooking, making art, weaving, making love, expressing anger, grieving, showing up, or coming together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maureen Walrath<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What if we are to radically change the way we see space\u2014relating to an environment not as a demarcated location, but an aggregated presence of a multitude of individuals? Not a lifeless combination of coordinates, but a moving, breathing, sensing crowd that we encounter, attune to, interact with? Not as a territory to be owned, but as a living and sensing being, or plenitude of beings? Then, as with any consensual relationship, we cannot assume that we can take; we must seek permission from these multitudes. And perhaps, they will say to us,\u00a0<em>no<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Re-wilding depends on perspective\u2014are we referring to large ecosystems with\/without humans or the act of rewilding one\u2019s self. I think the answer creates a different sensibility. Since so much has been written about rewilding landscapes, like reintroducing predators, I\u2019ll make it more personal. For me, rewilding is about seeing where wildness already exists within and around us and cultivating the wildness you seek in the world. This can be tending a surly garden or adventuring beyond one\u2019s creature comforts. In the case of the Mississippi, it can mean imagining a river without walls and then helping bring that into being again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Roopali Phadke<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We may not be prepared for this. It would require of us to collaborate, bond, and make friendship with our environments. We already know that plants respond to touch, to singing and music, to animate and lively spaces\u2014brushed and misted, moving with the movement of the world. There is trauma buried into generations of plants, from the rumbling of heavy machinery, the automated blades of ploughs, the choking exhaust, and leaking contaminants. As if having learned the burden of a friend, we must struggle with what do with this information. But is this not also a science? This spring of curiosity and responsibility is the very beginning of science. This root of empathy muddies the headwaters, mystifying the terms with which we can create our coming beginnings.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":12133,"post_author":"12","post_date":"2019-09-23 10:56:11","post_date_gmt":"2019-09-23 08:56:11","post_content":"","post_title":"Temporary continent.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"temporary-continent","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-10-28 13:53:16","post_modified_gmt":"2019-10-28 12:53:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=12133","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"fiona.shipwright","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/temporary-continent\/","acf":{"first_name":"","last_name":"Temporary continent.
