Edwards Lorenz\u2019 Chaos Theory or Ren\u00e9 Thom\u2019s Catastrophe Theory are just two examples with broad applications across different disciplines. One conclusion drawn from these theoretical foundations was the recognition of some general limits to planning and prediction and the \u201cwicked\u201d nature of some problems. The Canadian ecologist Crawford S. Holling explicitly acknowledged this situation both in his theoretical approach to ecosystems as well as in his methods to manage them. In his widely cited paper \u201cResilience and Stability of Ecosystems\u201d he developed a perspective that no longer focused on notions of \u201cequilibrium\u201d or \u201cbalance of nature,\u201d but in which, instead, he defined the complex measure of resilience that can account for the ability of an ecosystem to remain cohesive even while undergoing strong perturbations.

Thus, while previous models and environmental assessments have provided mainly static \u201csnapshots\u201d of the world, modeling, in contrast, should enable actors to actively engage with (eco)systems to allow for coevolutionary development. As professor and director of the Institute of Animal Resource Ecology at the University of British Columbia, and especially as head of the Ecology Project at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Holling invented processes of adaptive environmental assessment and management, which earned him a wide professional following beyond that of the environmental sciences. The adaptive management process consists of a carefully designed series of alternating workshops and research periods in which scientists from different disciplines, policymakers, and other stakeholders come together. Systems analysts helped to identify the various aspects of a problem, translated them into variables and integrated them into a model, with which the participants play in order to explore the potential impacts of different policy options, the sensitivity of the system under observation, and the sensitivity of the simulation model itself. Models used to foster such learning experience were understood as evolving devices of self-instruction.

One study was conducted in cooperation with the Alpine Research Center of Innsbruck University, the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the inhabitants of Obergurgl, a Tyrolean Alpine village that the researchers presented as a microcosm for the problem of economic growth in relation to limited ecological and social resources.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":21829,"id":21829,"title":"MWP_b5_Holling-Obergurgl_lay_16_02_18_opt2","filename":"MWP_b5_Holling-Obergurgl_lay_16_02_18_opt2.jpg","filesize":166188,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/MWP_b5_Holling-Obergurgl_lay_16_02_18_opt2.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/adaptive-modeling\/mwp_b5_holling-obergurgl_lay_16_02_18_opt2\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Taken from the Alpine Areas Workshop, IIASA Conference Proceedings CP-74-2, 6.","caption":"Major components of the Obergurgl model.

Holling summarized the process:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIts purpose was to examine the likely consequences of several options available for this high alpine region of Austria: zoning changes, building subsidy or taxation, ski-lift construction. In a 5-day workshop a model was built, and the alternative futures under the different options were examined. The results of this exercise became a topic of major consideration in the region, and we believe they made a significant impact on decision-making. After a 1-day planning meeting, a core group of 5 methodologists and 15 participants met for a 1-week workshop. [. . .] Several important problems were defined and clarified by the Obergurgl model. The initial concerns about environmental quality receded to minor significance. Of more concern was the obvious inability of the village to maintain its current style of life, which is associated with continued growth of the hotel industry. The land will run out; subsidization, taxation, and zoning changes can only alter the date. When the Obergurglers returned to their village after the workshop, they initiated a series of public discussions about the future of the village.

Applying transdisciplinary systems models to problems such as climate change or global food supply gives us useful heuristics while forcing us to think about complexity and to witness nonlinear and counterintuitive outcomes.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201cwickedness\u201d of Anthropocene concerns arises because the problems it raises are hard to formulate, for several reasons. First, such problems involve competing interests (individual, corporate, state, etc.), each of which holds a different perspective on the nature of the problem. Second, problem framing and solutions to problems are interdependent: what counts as a solution depends on how the problem is framed, and vice versa. Third, the nature of the problem, the constraints, and the available resources can change over time. Finally, efforts to solve one aspect of a wicked problem often create new, unanticipated problems. The Anthropocene is rife with examples of wicked problems. Examples include anthropogenic climate change, loss of biodiversity, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, and global food supply. Complex, interlocking feedbacks\u2014both positive and negative\u2014make such problems difficult to understand conceptually and defy simple and effective solutions. These problems also defy experimentation that could lead to a better grasp of potential solutions. The seminar focused on applying systems thinking to wicked problems, which involves gathering knowledge from many disciplines for aggregation at a higher level. Various models were used to work through solving examples of wicked problems. This facilitated a partial, somewhat abstract, but holistic grasp of problems and methods used to seek solutions that require interdisciplinary perspectives.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Modeling Wicked Problems","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-modelling-wicked-problems","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-02 18:03:54","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-02 16:03:54","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9147,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=20719","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"nicholas.houde","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-modelling-wicked-problems\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":23600,"id":23600,"title":"HKW_Modeling Wicked Problems","filename":"HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","filesize":1954821,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/campus-2014\/seminar-modelling-wicked-problems\/hkw_modeling-wicked-problems\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Illustration by Benedikt Rugar","caption":"","name":"hkw_modeling-wicked-problems","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":20719,"date":"2020-04-02 15:58:24","modified":"2020-04-02 15:58:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":7810,"height":5454,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":536,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":210,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":536,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":978,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1073,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1430,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":34,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/HKW_Modeling-Wicked-Problems.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1117}},"teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying transdisciplinary systems models to problems such as climate change or global food supply gives us useful heuristics while forcing us to think about complexity and to witness nonlinear and counterintuitive outcomes.<\/span><\/p>\n","contributors":[{"ID":3235,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:28","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:28","post_content":"","post_title":"Miriam Diamond","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"miriam-diamond","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 14:38:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 12:38:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/miriam-diamond\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/miriam-diamond\/","acf":{"first_name":"Miriam ","last_name":"Diamond"}},{"ID":3263,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:30","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:30","post_content":"","post_title":"Paul N.
