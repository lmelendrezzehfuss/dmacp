The name derives from the Ecuadorian Yasun\u00ed Ishpingo Tambococha Tiputini (Yasun\u00ed-ITT) initiative, which called on the international community to prevent the expansion of oil fields in Yasun\u00ed National Park, but\u00a0<em>\u201cChallenge Yasun\u00ed\u201d<\/em>is also used as an emblematic case for a broader discussion about global challenges that result from complex interactions between anthropogenic environmental changes.<\/p>\n<p>The participative exhibition is a collaboration between Stella Veciana and Dan Norton. When it was first presented at the Center for Development Research in Bonn, it showed an interactive video-interface projected onto a kentia palm tree and a series of posters with quotes from interviewed experts of the so-called \u201cglobal North\u201d and \u201cglobal South.\u201d The interactive interface contains a growing archive of video interviews that connect specialist knowledge from a continuous series of transdisciplinary conferences. The key questions of the interviews address themes such as present resource policies, their impact on environmental and human rights, and possible ecologically friendly and good-governance alternatives to extractive and neo-extractive development models. Other interviews discuss topics relating to sustainability research and Buen Vivir. The interactive software allows extended video interviews to be analyzed and classified by theme and topic, and then these topics are categorized using key words in a drop-down menu, making each interview sequence directly accessible. This allows all interview comments that have been made regarding, for example, the key words Buen Vivir to be easily found, selected, and discussed on the site. Similar themes and references from specialists of the North and South can be compared, contrasted, and synthesized. Knowledge locked within long narratives can be identified, selected, and mixed. The user\u2019s own line of inquiry directs the narrative between the key words, and allows the interviews to respond to the viewer\u2019s own interests.

One such way is to focus on the development of an imaginary museum, whose galleries open up vistas for everyone seeking alternate ways to educate students and think about global change.<\/span><\/p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, global knowledge is often packaged for the \u201cfast and furious\u201d commercial media, or challenged by the democratic social media, but this module focuses on a \u201cthird way\u201d: \u201cslow media\u201d that, by analogy with the slow food movement, engages with the complexities of a rapidly changing world by slowing down to the pace of a museum visit or engaging with physical or visual objects. The idea of the Anthropocene demands thinking about a Long Now\u2014that is, not just a single human lifetime but up to seven generations, as suggested by <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/longnow.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Long Now Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To this we added the global imaginary, the Big Here: the local is now planetary in scale. An Anthropocene imaginary demands a sense of global citizenship and a consciousness on the part of an observer that includes their great-grandparents and their great-children. Having a \u201cglobal soul\u201d (to use Pico Iyer\u2019s term) and dwelling across generations stretches and stresses the human sense of self. The idea of doing such imagining at a slower pace in a physical place or with real objects, offers an alternative to the \u201csound bite\u201d approach to communicating complex ideas. One way to make the idea of slowing down concrete and accessible is through extending our understanding of the museum as a place that exhibits and preserves objects and artifacts. With the idea of an imaginary museum that holds individual objects and collections the seminar wants to offer new tools not only for people working in museums, but for everyone seeking alternative ways to educate students and citizens to think about global change and ways of living in the Anthropocene.<\/span><\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Slow
