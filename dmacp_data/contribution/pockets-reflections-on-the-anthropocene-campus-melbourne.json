After the End of the World<\/h2>\n<p>In their closing keynote on \u2018transmutation of the elements, radioactive refugeeism, and alchemical wanderings\u2019, Karen Barad re\/turns us to our inherited futures passed. Frustrated with the doings of their beloved physics, Barad set out to retrace the legacies of Nuclear Physics in its smallest bits, to reunite it with meaning again.<\/p>\n<p>I find myself folded forward to try to take in more of Barad\u2019s artful primer on Theoretical Physics and Quantum Field Theory. Barad is carefully pulling physics through itself to dismantle the idea of the discrete divisions that separate a past and present, here and there, other and self.<\/p>\n<p>Central to Newtonian physics, is the idea of the void: a background against which matter takes its place. The void does not have matter\/doesn\u2019t matter. This, Barad says, is the logic at the heart of occupation and the expansion of empire. It is an act of a\/voidance of the human and the non-human and of relations, times, histories, possibilities in a place, that makes for conquest and Colonialism, or, as they explored in their talk, the rendering of an island as the test-site for nuclear warfare.<\/p>\n<p>But as Quantum Field Theory has it, the void is always in motion, filled with infinite virtual im\/possibilities of life, death, being, non-being, time and matter. A virtual particle can emerge into being\/life when energy is put into the void, and can slip back into non-being, emitting that energy.<\/p>\n<p>Barad shows us how, in the heart of the void, the emotional life of a \u2018self-touching electron\u2019 in a vacuum of infinities queers any notion of continuity, and unhinges matters of time and space. There is laughter in the room when they read a quote from Richard Feynman, who expresses horror at the perverse life of the electron and proposes his theory of Renormalization, dressing the deviance of the electron with the infinity of the void so that the particle can be captured in time and space. They call this \u201cthe electron in drag<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">Barad, Karen. \u201cAfter the End of the World: Transmutation of the Elements, Radioactive Refugeeism, and Alchemical Wanderings.\u201d Keynote Lecture, Anthropocene Campus Melbourne, Melbourne, 6 September 2018.<\/span><\/span><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the void, all possible histories are im\/possible at the same time.
