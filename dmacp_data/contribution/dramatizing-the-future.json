It led to more uncomfortable questions: As a writer of fiction, is it a problem to use the predicted extinctions and environmental catastrophes of the not too distant future to produce (amongst other things) stakes in a literary production?<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<h2>Politics of Forecasting<\/h2>\n<p>We are living in a time of dire forecasts. We\u2019ve been doing so, quite happily, for at least half a century. But now, given the pervasiveness of data about climate change, our strategy of maintaining business as usual has assumed the characteristics of a theatre of cruelty that we bought tickets for and now only want to watch, stunned as events unfold. Even if we meet the goals of the Paris Agreement\u2014and that doesn\u2019t look good given the flexible definition of the term \u201cagree\u201d that some world leaders appear to have\u2014we are facing predicted challenges that range from increased crop losses due to drought and insect proliferation, the reduction of large fish populations in Australian waters by a third in the next decade (a statistic mirrored internationally), increased flooding in the UK, increases in hurricanes and wildfires in the US, increases in bushfires in Australia, and, accompanying this, massive increases in environmental refugee populations. These developments have global ramifications, although the poorest countries and people are bearing the brunt. In wealthy nations, such as Australia, we can see the future clearly enough, but the preparation we are most focussed on is scaffolding the terms of our denial.<\/p>\n<p>Given this, the near future world of my novel might seem too close for comfort. The story occurs in an affluent Western-yet-unlocated setting where people are obsessed with imagining an imminent, life-changing catastrophe such as those that unlucky others live with day-to-day. Perhaps the most frightening aspect of this world is how thoroughly depoliticised crisis has become. In this future, we are experts at description and obliteration. Disaster management is outsourced to private companies who move an underclass of those \u201cfor whom a stake in the new interurban lifestyle is not an option\u201d through the landscape in roving trailer packs. This is sustainability co-opted, a dystopian climax to Rob Nixon\u2019s slow violence.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Nixon R. 2011, <em>Slow violence and the environmentalism of the poor<\/em>, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In writing, I set out to parody some of the rhetorical foundations we lay to protect us from the hopelessness and desperation which characterizes thinking the future in this particular present. The protagonist, Max Galleon, is the wealthy creator of fully immersive disaster films which allow the rich to voyeuristically consume the experience of surviving catastrophe. Galleon\u2019s works are the inheritors of an ideological agenda that runs through present day depictions of environmental catastrophe in Hollywood films which, as Judith Hess Wright argues, \u201csimplify complex social structures and provide resolution.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Hess Wright, J. 2003, &#8220;Genre Films and the Status Quo.&#8221; Chap. 4, <em>Film Genre Reader 3<\/em>, edited by Barry Keith Grant. 41\u201349.

When the continually scrutinized sea levels rise against the landmass known as Pitcairn Island, and experts predict a catastrophe of world scale, a previously-thought extinct giant ground sloth suddenly stages a second coming. The event gets spun: perhaps the sloth pup signifies a new age for Earth, a return to the charismatic megafauna. The animal, dubbed Hope, disappears again as soon as it becomes clear that humanity will once again prevail. Presumably she will rest up, ready to be trucked out next time. Hope is required.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<h2>Environmental Instability and Neoliberalism<\/h2>\n<p>Naomi Klein\u2019s 2007 book\u00a0<em>The Shock Doctrine<\/em> prompted me to imagine what it would look like if increasing environmental instability allowed a tightening rather than a shattering of the neoliberal trajectory we are presently on. As I built the world of the novel, I asked myself, if disaster capitalism dominates, what will human life look like in forty years?

In my novel, as the natural world collapses Max and his family monitor the data in an infinite scroll that sets their daily nutritional goals, tasks, and personal histories alongside updates on major extinction events. They participate in the kind of self-surveillance to which we already devote so much of our time. They fret in an architecturally designed mansion that can turn into a fort, hermetically sealing their way of life inside.<\/p>\n<p>When I launched the novel at Fuller\u2019s Bookstore in Hobart, the chalkboard read \u201cTonight, The Island Will Sink,\u201d and then in parentheses: \u201c(don\u2019t worry, not this island)\u201d. We forecast, and then we say, \u201cdon\u2019t worry too much, not now.\u201d We say, \u201cthis might be the future, but the present is still just fine.\u201d This, then, might be the inherent ethic of speculative fiction for me. It is immediate. It brings a future to a reader and makes them hang out there. Here, I wrote this, it\u2019s just one dramatised forecast. Did I get it right? I really hope not, but I\u2019ll leave it with you.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":26072,"post_author":"97","post_date":"2020-05-28 13:40:29","post_date_gmt":"2020-05-28 11:40:29","post_content":"","post_title":"Briohny Doyle","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"briohny-doyle","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-05-28 13:40:46","post_modified_gmt":"2020-05-28 11:40:46","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=26072","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"friederike.becker","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/briohny-doyle\/","acf":{"first_name":"Briohny","last_name":"Doyle"}}],"projects":[{"ID":11633,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2018-11-07 15:45:31","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-07 14:45:31","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">How can the concept of \u201cthe Elemental\u201d inform the ways in which we speak about the Anthropocene?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n  <p>The theme of \u201cthe Elemental\u201d served as the organizing scheme of the <em>Anthropocene Campus Melbourne<\/em> and operated as a reference point for the articulation of genuinely anthropocenic questions and research paths.
