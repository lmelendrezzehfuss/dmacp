This approach reveals the intermingling of the different actors and their associated competing interests. One has to take the side seat of the moderator and listen to each stakeholder in order to obtain a more balanced understanding of the situation. Here we take this approach literally by proposing the voices of forgotten stakeholders, i.e. those that contemporary Western capitalist cultures tend to view as inert and lacking agency. Agency, however, assumes many forms. It is a pervasive and inbuilt property of matter and part of its generative dynamism. From this reality emerges an intertwined flux of material and discursive forces. Thus we focus on the actual geo-\/bio-resources that make (or break) the Maldives, such as the sand, coral, and the all-encompassing \u201cblue.\u201d Our intention is to raise the major challenge of representation, a key aspect of the filtering process. To address this aspect of the filter, we use computer-generated voices such as those used in GPS systems: a machine interprets the words that were attributed to these unusual stakeholders; the biases built into machine intonation are integrated as a coproduction with humans.<\/p>\n<p>Realizing what the Anthropocene entails is a wake-up call towards reworking and reinventing human relationships with nonhuman agents, be they plant, animal, mineral, or gas. All things and beings have the ability to communicate something of themselves to other beings, and what these voices are telling us is that it might finally be time to listen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<h1>Voice of the blue<\/h1>\n<p>By <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/hanna-husberg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hanna Husberg<\/a><\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"image","display":"column","image":[{"ID":21709,"id":21709,"title":"Deconstructing the We_Voice of the blue","filename":"Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue.jpg","filesize":60378,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/deconstructing-the-we\/deconstructing-the-we_voice-of-the-blue\/","alt":"","author":"96","description":"Image by Ellie Irons","caption":"","name":"deconstructing-the-we_voice-of-the-blue","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":21625,"date":"2020-03-24 16:20:47","modified":"2020-03-25 14:24:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1768,"height":995,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue-768x432.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":432,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue-300x169.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":169,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue-768x432.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":432,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue-1400x788.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":788,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue-1536x864.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":864,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue.jpg","2048x2048-width":1768,"2048x2048-height":995,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Deconstructing-the-We_Voice-of-the-blue-1600x900.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":900}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/w.soundcloud.com\/player\/?url=https%3A\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/233287575%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-hcErQ&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"<p><em>I won.
