Today, it is increasingly recognized that the effects of these attempts at hydrological control have proven of both local and planetary consequence. This short essay is part of a longer work which sets out the long history of attempts to put not just the river but the entire Mississippi watershed to work. These visions of a productive basin, realized or not, demonstrate the limits of human intentionality when faced with the complex cascades of relations set into motion by flowing water. Here the idea of a working watershed is explored via observations made in October 2019 during the fourth leg of the <em>Anthropocene River Journey,<\/em> and the consultation of both paper and sedimentary archives.<\/p>\n<h1>Foremost a basin<\/h1>\n<p>Bisecting the continent, the distinct energy geography of the Mississippi River has long influenced patterns of settlement, trade, and industry in North America and beyond. The various names it has been known by, from the \u201cMisi-ziibi,\u201d to \u201cMother of Rivers\u201d or \u201cFather of the Waters,\u201d \u201cBig Muddy,\u201d to the \u201cstrong brown god,\u201d also demonstrate its deep cultural resonances. Moreover, its unstoppable flow has inspired myriad plans for a more productive watershed. But before getting to this point, one might ask, why think in terms of basins at all? The Anthropocene denotes a new earth historical era, in which the planetary appears to be the scale at which human actions reach their most urgent conclusion. In response, this essay suggests that rather than immediately scaling up our thinking to such an all-encompassing perspective, we should consider the transformative capacities of the Earth system\u2019s component <em>regions<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Less-easily defined, these planetary provinces are distinguished by shared dynamic properties.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">According to this definition, the planet is of course also region.<\/span><\/span><\/span> The archetypal region is the river basin, a site in which the hydrological cycle offers an observable degree of holism. But regions defy abstraction and can only be discussed in specific terms. A belief in regionalism testifies to the belief that true descriptions of earthly processes can be understood only as an outcome of the interaction between physical laws, ecology, and human interventions manifest in specific places, a structure of relations from which myriad possibilities emerge.<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content-inner\">For a clear articulation of regionalism, see Richard Hartshorne, <em>The Nature of Geography: a critical survey of current thought in the light of the past<\/em>, Lancaster, PA: Association of American Geographers, 1935, p. 289.<\/span><\/span><\/span> Regions might be thought of as meaningful components of a prohibitively complex Earth system which can only be understood via abstraction. Regionalism heads in the other direction, toward the specific and the local. Moreover, rather than working with computational abstractions, geographers have long argued that regions can only truly be understood via fieldwork: by direct engagement with place.<\/p>\n<p>So it was that in October 2019 I joined a venerable group of paddlers who have sought to understand the Mississippi by entering its flow. In travelling by canoe, environmental historian Richard White has written, you get to know nature through labor. You become intimately acquainted with a river\u2019s unique energy geography, be it through paddling, or negotiating its currents, eddies, whorls, and boils. You can also become aware of the labor-saving potentialities of its flow, the shifting velocities of its meanders, and the smoothing or roughening effects of riverbed topography; a variety of propulsive means that require more experience than brawn.<\/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"embed","title":"","embed":"<iframe title=\"Hydrodynamics flow on the Mississippi River\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/435065248?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"219\" height=\"390\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","caption":"Hydro-, thermo-, and human dynamics in flow, St, Johns Bayou, New Madrid, Missouri. 18 October 2019.
