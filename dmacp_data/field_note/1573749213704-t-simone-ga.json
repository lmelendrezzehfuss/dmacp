A fetish commodity and the technology through which other humans and public and private enterprises accelerated this anthropocenic epoch. Having at one time been property, today was extremely heavy. Not only the moving through the city but that one of our group members could not be accommodated and therefore could not move with us. Value valuelessness confinement disposability. I find myself a bit stuck tonight. I hope that we can see the lingering and far reaching effects of racial capitalism and its relationship to the Anthropocene. I hope that we see the the racism and ableism within the environmental injustices we witness and participate in. I hope we see that New Orleans is here but that New Orleans is also everywhere.","latitude":"29.9508329","longitude":"-90.0692353","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","media":false,"linked_projects":false,"methods":false,"keywords":false,"folksonomy":false},"author_name":"t.simone.ga","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/15581"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/81"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/15581\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25307,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/15581\/revisions\/25307"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15581"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=15581"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=15581"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=15581"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
