Students of the Augsburg University\u2019s <em>River Semester <\/em>and twenty-five scholars, artists, and activists from around the world bring together the findings and practices of the individual field stations and collect their own observational research, making connections with local people along the way. Participants will use their <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em> online pages to collect the research and draw it into a common narrative depicting the downstream connections of the river system, engaging ongoing debates on how to react to, cope, and deal with the effects of the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n <p>How do we travel through the Anthropocene? This question is not only an ecologically ethical one\u2014being directly related to processes of resource depletion and fossil fuel extraction\u2014but also has an aesthetically conceptual dimension. Previously, travel anticipated the unknown\u2014a \u201cforeignness\u201d\u2014which the traveler or travelers familiarized themselves with and appropriated. In the Anthropocene, where a limitless interweaving of humankind, nature, technology, and economics replaces the white patches of terra incognita, this logic runs into nothingness. But what travel routes, forms of travel, and narratives are suitable for the new planetary realities? And how could travel be understood as a cultural technique of relating to something rather than as a process of appropriation?<\/p>\n<p>These are the prerequisites under which students, scientists, artists, journalists, and authors explore the Mississippi in an <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em>. Calling in at the five Field stations along the river, travelers develop and test new types of access to the complexity of the Anthropocene river system in talks, lectures, and excursions. At some stages, they are accompanied by students from Augsburg University, Minneapolis, who, as part of the <em>River Semester<\/em>, are covering the entire length of the Mississippi River\u2014from the source regions in the north to the Gulf of Mexico\u2014in canoes and vans in about eighty days. In experimental seminars on ecology, political science, biology, art, astronomy, and history, they are seeking answers to the challenges of the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Anthropocene River Journey","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"anthropocene-river-journey","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-05 14:50:53","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-05 12:50:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":8,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2775","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":2749,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-20 18:39:51","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-20 16:39:51","post_content":"<p>The art initiative <em>Laboratory for a Radical Suburbia <\/em>explores human connections to both land and to the environmental impacts of capitalist cycles of extraction, production, and consumption on that land.<\/p>\n Laboratory for a Radical Suburbia <p>In the past five years, America\u2019s suburbanized landscape has emerged as a site of urgent contestation\u2014arguably the defining geography of the national political moment. However, while the fields of art and design have largely failed to engage this critical space, <em>Laboratory for Suburbia<\/em> is a yearlong project inviting artists, designers, and others to respond to legacies of suburbanization\u2014and to do so in St. Louis. Presenting a potent paradigm for suburbanization in the twenty-first century\u2014just as Los Angeles did in the twentieth\u2014St. Louis is an illustration of a region where sprawl continues apace not because of explosive population growth but despite the lack of it, in the face of economic precariousness, population stagnation, and racial anxiety. The project is an initiative organized by the Luminary art space located in St. Louis.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n <p>\u201cDomesticating the Anthropocene\u201d\u2014the first public component of <em>Laboratory for Suburbia<\/em>\u2014consists of two bus tours investigating suburbia as a characteristic spatial form of the Anthropocene in the global North. Suburbia is not only resource-intensive to build and maintain, but both its physical form and the ways of life that operate in it can often negate human connections to the land and obscure the environmental impacts of capitalist extraction, production, and consumption. Considering the extensive legacy of nuclear contamination that affects suburban watersheds in St. Louis, bearing in mind also the accelerating cycle of century storms and floods in the Midwest, the route the tour takes will stitch together both the region\u2019s vast suburban landscape and its great rivers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","post_title":"Domesticating the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"laboratory-for-a-radical-suburbia","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-09-11 16:36:45","post_modified_gmt":"2019-09-11 14:36:45","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2749","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}],"methods":[{"term_id":4,"name":"Field Study","slug":"field-study","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":4,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":111,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":6,"name":"Modeling","slug":"modeling","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":6,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":17,"filter":"raw"}],"keywords":[{"term_id":219,"name":"Geo-engineering","slug":"geo-engineering","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":219,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":11,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":228,"name":"Imaginary","slug":"imaginary","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":228,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":29,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":233,"name":"Landscape","slug":"landscape","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":233,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":80,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":241,"name":"Model","slug":"model","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":241,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":17,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":255,"name":"Scale","slug":"scale","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":255,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":27,"filter":"raw"}],"folksonomy":[{"term_id":305,"name":"Overlook","slug":"overlook","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":305,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":374,"name":"Cement","slug":"cement","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":374,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":3,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":376,"name":"Confluence","slug":"confluence","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":376,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw"}]},"author_name":"underhil","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14019"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/17"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14019\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25564,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14019\/revisions\/25564"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=14019"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=14019"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=14019"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=14019"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
