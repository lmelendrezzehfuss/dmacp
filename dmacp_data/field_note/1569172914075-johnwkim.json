The location of Field Station 1 events. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSt. Anthony Falls was the upper limit of commercial navigation on the Mississippi until two dams and a series of locks were built between 1948 and 1963 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The locks made commercial navigation possible above Minneapolis. At midnight on June 9, 2015, the Upper St. Anthony Falls lock was permanently closed by Section 2010 of \"H.R.3080 - Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014\" which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on June 10, 2014, and was required to be implemented \"Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment\" The closure is intended to stop the spread of invasive species, namely two types of Asian carp: bighead carp and silver carp. Minneapolis is once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPhoto by Alicia Johnson.
