Here, the Mississippi River is a hydraulic cleave through a territory that is rife with contradiction: once the meeting point of the tribes of the Osage and the Illinois, the Cahokia and the Missouri; once a boundary between empires; once a line between the free and the enslaved; still a real and conceptual divide to collective imagination and action. Along this river, which troubles the totalizing binaries of corporations and individuals, environmental devastation and renewal, rural and urban geography, distant past and uncertain present, these latent histories and liminal boundaries rise to the surface and resist any form of clean analysis, any easy narrative closure.<\/p>\n <p><em>Anthropocene Vernacular<\/em>\u00a0foregrounds the ways that the rewriting of human geo-logics is not simply something out there\u2014in the spectacularly disturbing landscapes that have come to signify our contemporary anthropocenic epoch\u2014but, rather, is deeply interwoven right here, in the decisions, assumptions, and textures of everyday life.

What governs this constitution (or collision) of forces? What are the contingent, strategic, or cascading events and networks that form durable apparatuses among them? The exploratory research project <em>Technosphere 2015\u20132019<\/em> investigated the origins and future itineraries of technological agency in the Anthropocene in a series of inquisitive, multiday events taking place annually at HKW and several publication outlets.<\/p>\n <p>Is it possible to grasp the world at the planetary scale? Perhaps the challenges of the Anthropocene make it a necessity, despite how impossible the task might seem to be. Caught between the rapidly shifting baselines of global climate and ecospheric stability, amidst cultural, political, and economic tumult, the increasing interdependency of natural environments, human culture, and global-scale technologies is difficult to comprehend. Technologies have already shaped the world as a metropolis of fossil energy and an entangled industrial metabolism, but now go on to increasingly determine what forms of existence are possible to start with. From satellite networks to domestic-care techniques to cultural forms of expression to engineered bacteria, they challenge established worldviews and the values these are based upon. How can we produce new forms of action that enable us to steer these dynamics? And what forms could life take within the frame of these actions?<\/p>\n<p>Scientists and thinkers introduced the term \u201ctechnosphere\u201d to describe the technical mobilization and hybridization of energy, materials, and environments into a planetary system comparable in scale and function to the biosphere or hydrosphere. The term emphasizes the driving role of the technological in the transition to the Anthropocene. At the same time, its appellation encompasses the enclosure of human populations, forests, rivers, and other traditionally nontechnical entities within systems of technical management and productivity. But where is that ominous technosphere to be found? How does it operate? What impact will it have on the everyday concerns of humans and their experiences? And how did we all end up in this world of technological vertigo?<\/p>\n<p>Five different aspects of these questions brought together actors from the arts, sciences, and society in a series of multiday events at HKW between 2015 and 2019. investigated how planetary-scale apparatuses and emerging modes and functions of the technological can be characterized. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hkw.de\/en\/programm\/projekte\/2016\/technosphaerenwissen\/technosphaerenwissen_start.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Technosphere\u00a0Knowledge<\/a>\u2014a public event accompanying the <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hkw.de\/en\/programm\/projekte\/2015\/curriculum_campus_technosphere\/campus_the_technosphere_issue.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropocene Campus: The Technosphere Issue<\/a><\/em>\u2014focused on how the technosphere and knowledge production condition, sustain, and multiply each other. The event identified the mid-twentieth century as a decisive moment when rapid changes in micro- and macro-technologies, economics, industry, and policy set up the conditions to propel the technosphere\u2019s agency.
