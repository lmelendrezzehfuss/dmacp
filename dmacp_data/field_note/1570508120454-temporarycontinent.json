Here, the Mississippi River is a hydraulic cleave through a territory that is rife with contradiction: once the meeting point of the tribes of the Osage and the Illinois, the Cahokia and the Missouri; once a boundary between empires; once a line between the free and the enslaved; still a real and conceptual divide to collective imagination and action. Along this river, which troubles the totalizing binaries of corporations and individuals, environmental devastation and renewal, rural and urban geography, distant past and uncertain present, these latent histories and liminal boundaries rise to the surface and resist any form of clean analysis, any easy narrative closure.<\/p>\n <p><em>Anthropocene Vernacular<\/em>\u00a0foregrounds the ways that the rewriting of human geo-logics is not simply something out there\u2014in the spectacularly disturbing landscapes that have come to signify our contemporary anthropocenic epoch\u2014but, rather, is deeply interwoven right here, in the decisions, assumptions, and textures of everyday life. Artists, researchers, and community organizers will share through a series of projects the multigenerational story of how this region\u2019s people have cultivated an embodied, everyday culture in the midst of the intense convergence of social, environmental, and economic crises.

That is to say, through seeds, we can date the beginning of a preferential system for plant selection and domestication in relation to human settlements in the American Bottom region. Archeologic evidence points to at least five native plants, known as lost crops, as the foundation for unique local agro-ecosystems in the area. Yet \u201czeacentrism\u201d\u2014the focus on maize as the enabler of (North American) civilization\u2014has largely eclipsed this significant period of our agricultural heritage. In fact, these lost crops were likely to have been cultivated alongside maize, some surviving, and developing into landraces we recognize today like sunflowers and squash. During the Mississippian era\u2014over 1,000 years ago, and up to the influence of the colonial-era\u2014most communities in Eastern North America adopted maize agriculture, which experienced a morphological evolution while vigorously integrating into landscape cultivation and cultural consumption. Furthermore, within the last 200 years, we see yet another dominant wave of human-influenced production through the ongoing standardization and ubiquity of monocultures that have come to define our contemporary landscapes of production. Research in this area enables us to chart the changes through time, indexing progressive rhythms of what has been lost and gained through postnatural and human ecologies, and to arrive at the industrialized agricultural landscapes of the present.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Postnatural Landscapes","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"postnatural-landscapes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-06-17 09:58:41","post_modified_gmt":"2020-06-17 07:58:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=8887","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":3464,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-22 10:20:52","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-22 08:20:52","post_content":"<p>Temporary<em> continent.<\/em> maps the unstable tributaries of contributions and reflections arising from the research procession down the river.<\/p>\n  <p>Temporary <em>continent.<\/em> maps the unstable tributaries of contributions, reflections, and media arising from <em>Mississippi.
