Here, the Mississippi River is a hydraulic cleave through a territory that is rife with contradiction: once the meeting point of the tribes of the Osage and the Illinois, the Cahokia and the Missouri; once a boundary between empires; once a line between the free and the enslaved; still a real and conceptual divide to collective imagination and action. Along this river, which troubles the totalizing binaries of corporations and individuals, environmental devastation and renewal, rural and urban geography, distant past and uncertain present, these latent histories and liminal boundaries rise to the surface and resist any form of clean analysis, any easy narrative closure.<\/p>\n <p><em>Anthropocene Vernacular<\/em>\u00a0foregrounds the ways that the rewriting of human geo-logics is not simply something out there\u2014in the spectacularly disturbing landscapes that have come to signify our contemporary anthropocenic epoch\u2014but, rather, is deeply interwoven right here, in the decisions, assumptions, and textures of everyday life. Artists, researchers, and community organizers will share through a series of projects the multigenerational story of how this region\u2019s people have cultivated an embodied, everyday culture in the midst of the intense convergence of social, environmental, and economic crises. This grounded practice asks epistemological questions about how the normative academic approach to the Anthropocene has bracketed-out of its field of vision the very center of this age\u2019s ongoing dynamics\u2014the expression and knowledge of those communities who have experienced, and indeed survive within, these landscapes of the Anthropocene. This Field Station will focus on how the vernaculars of peoples, places, and landscapes have undergone layering and blurring in order to shape the region over time.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Field Station 3: Anthropocene Vernacular","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-06-17 09:58:10","post_modified_gmt":"2020-06-17 07:58:10","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":579,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2712","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":3464,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-22 10:20:52","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-22 08:20:52","post_content":"<p>Temporary<em> continent.<\/em> maps the unstable tributaries of contributions and reflections arising from the research procession down the river.<\/p>\n  <p>Temporary <em>continent.<\/em> maps the unstable tributaries of contributions, reflections, and media arising from <em>Mississippi.
