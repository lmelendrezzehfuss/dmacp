Starting off our Aldo Leopold tour, we walked his old tramping grounds in Crapo Park where we explored a waterfall, climbed into a cave, walked alongside a limestone bluff, and listened to Steve Brower talk about the Leopold family\u2019s connection to the area. We continued on to an oak savanna in Burlington that is part of a restoration project by the Leopold Landscape Alliance. We finished the night with a tour of both Leopold homes, a lovely dinner with Steve and his beautiful wife Kathy and some of the board members of the Leopold Landscape Alliance, and slept soundly in Aldo\u2019s childhood home. A huge thank you to Steve, Kathy and the Leopold Landscape Alliance for your generosity and wealth of knowledge.
