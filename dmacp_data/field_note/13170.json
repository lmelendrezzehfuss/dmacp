This stretch of the Mississippi River marks both its \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201canthropogenic\u201d origin, where a small creek becomes a continental torrent, where the Dakota, Ojibwe, and many other native peoples centered their material and spiritual lives, and where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has pursued its mandate to organize, manage, and direct the river\u2019s flow for almost two centuries.<\/p>\n <p>Along the Upper Mississippi River, engineering has taken the form of extensive infrastructural interventions into the river, including the building of 29 locks and dams and ongoing dredging to maintain a nine-foot deep navigation channel for ships carrying agricultural and industrial products. These interventions have been figured as projects of control, demonstrative of expertise and the power of humans to govern nature. Field Station 1 begins from the premise that past infrastructural interventions into the Mississippi River as well as proposed future projects are better understood as experiments, ones engaged under conditions of uncertainty and therefore inherently speculative.<\/p>\n<p>The region including the headwaters is an expansive tapestry of lakes, marshes, streams and rivers consisting of native lands, state parks, a large urban conglomeration, and rural municipalities. Understanding the Mississippi River as a site of speculations recognizes it to be a space of power. Field Station 1 connects projects and initiatives that conceptualize the Mississippi as a site of experimentation, speculation, and ongoing struggle in order to think about the communities, places, materials, creatures, interventions and imaginations that coalesce or disperse around the river. It asks who gets to experiment with the river; how experimentation figures into larger projects of state-building, social justice, and self-determination; how climate change can affect local decision-making; and how the flow of the river links upriver and downriver in complex and nonlinear ways. Field Station 1 reflects on the region as assemblage, characterized by overlapping experiences of space, time, water, land, precarity, opportunity, and possibility across multispecies relations. In so doing, it invites creative engagement with diverse experiences of the region.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","post_title":"Field Station 1: Sediment, Settlement, Sentiment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"field-station-1-sediment-settlement-sentiment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-02 12:17:15","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-02 11:17:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":579,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=1247","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":2704,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-20 14:21:16","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-20 12:21:16","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A multilayered project towards the de-regulation of nature.<\/span><\/p>\n  <p>The possibilities and challenges of the post-industrialization of the Mississippi River in the Twin Cities\u2014and the complex social-ecological issues that arise as a result\u2014are the focus of the multimedia and multi-layered project led by Morgan Adamson, Bruce Brau, and Roopali Phadke.<\/p>\n <p>The project looks at two aspects of the urban context in which the upper Mississippi is being reimagined. The first is the redevelopment of formerly industrial spaces, while the second concerns the potential de-commissioning of two dams, leading to the \u201crewilding\u201d of the river. In light of the economic transformations that have taken place within both Minneapolis and St. Paul over the past two decades, the project\u00a0 seeks to understand how the Anthropocene River intersects with issues of gentrification, racial justice, and notions of wilderness that come with de-industrialization. It also examines the ecological implications of these transformations and their consequences for a river situated in a settler-colonial context.<\/p>\n<p>The project has four main components. The first is a documentary film class at Macalester College taught by Morgan Adamson devoted to studying the redevelopment of the Upper Harbor Terminal in North Minneapolis. Second is a public forum with stakeholders from both the redevelopment and the dam removal project. Walking tours of relevant sites, such as Pigs Eye in St. Paul, the Upper Harbor in Minneapolis, as well as Ford Lock and Dam will be included as well. Lastly, media projects, including a short documentary film on the Upper Harbor Terminal redevelopment and a website with photographs and interpretive descriptions of relevant sites (inspired by the American Bottoms project form the St. Louis field station), will afford another layer of access to the project.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","post_title":"Contesting the De-industrial Futures of the Upper Mississippi","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"contesting-the-de-industrial-futures-of-the-upper-mississippi","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-09-16 17:48:20","post_modified_gmt":"2019-09-16 15:48:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":1247,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2704","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}],"methods":[{"term_id":336,"name":"Conversation","slug":"conversation","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":336,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":118,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":333,"name":"Film","slug":"film","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":333,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":49,"filter":"raw"}],"keywords":[{"term_id":208,"name":"Engagement","slug":"engagement","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":208,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":28,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":248,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":248,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":3,"filter":"raw"}],"folksonomy":[{"term_id":358,"name":"Mobility","slug":"mobility","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":358,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":5,"filter":"raw"}]},"author_name":"Christoph Rosol","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/13170"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/26"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/13170\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25215,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/13170\/revisions\/25215"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=13170"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=13170"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=13170"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=13170"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
