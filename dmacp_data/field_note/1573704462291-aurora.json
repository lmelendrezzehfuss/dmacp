Yesterday, Tuesday, I spent the afternoon with my group in Cancer Alley, breathing extremely polluted air. Although I didn't feel sick at the time, I know it taxed my system. Today, when at least three members of our seminar lit up cigarettes within a few feet of me in the first moments of our walking tour, my body reacted with burning lung pain, difficulty breathing, nausea and headache. I had to go home.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMany hours later, my body is still in a flare up of symptoms, a common event for people with environmental illness, so I won't be able to make my group's journey to tribal lands tomorrow.  But I will participate from afar. I will follow the field notes threads (pictures, please!) but I think my most useful contribution will be to write about why disability justice is an essential framework to include in our collective work. I will also attempt a crash course on access\/inclusion and how ablist assumptions about productivity, efficiency, affordability and the individual right to contaminate shared spaces have made the Campus an uneven playing field. My inability to attend tomorow's field trip is not a personal misfortune. It's an illustration. It's an anthropocenic event. Stay tuned.  Aurora<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPS.
