Students of the Augsburg University\u2019s <em>River Semester <\/em>and twenty-five scholars, artists, and activists from around the world bring together the findings and practices of the individual field stations and collect their own observational research, making connections with local people along the way. Participants will use their <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em> online pages to collect the research and draw it into a common narrative depicting the downstream connections of the river system, engaging ongoing debates on how to react to, cope, and deal with the effects of the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n <p>How do we travel through the Anthropocene? This question is not only an ecologically ethical one\u2014being directly related to processes of resource depletion and fossil fuel extraction\u2014but also has an aesthetically conceptual dimension. Previously, travel anticipated the unknown\u2014a \u201cforeignness\u201d\u2014which the traveler or travelers familiarized themselves with and appropriated. In the Anthropocene, where a limitless interweaving of humankind, nature, technology, and economics replaces the white patches of terra incognita, this logic runs into nothingness. But what travel routes, forms of travel, and narratives are suitable for the new planetary realities? And how could travel be understood as a cultural technique of relating to something rather than as a process of appropriation?<\/p>\n<p>These are the prerequisites under which students, scientists, artists, journalists, and authors explore the Mississippi in an <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em>. Calling in at the five Field stations along the river, travelers develop and test new types of access to the complexity of the Anthropocene river system in talks, lectures, and excursions. At some stages, they are accompanied by students from Augsburg University, Minneapolis, who, as part of the <em>River Semester<\/em>, are covering the entire length of the Mississippi River\u2014from the source regions in the north to the Gulf of Mexico\u2014in canoes and vans in about eighty days. In experimental seminars on ecology, political science, biology, art, astronomy, and history, they are seeking answers to the challenges of the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Anthropocene River Journey","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"anthropocene-river-journey","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-05 14:50:53","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-05 12:50:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":8,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2775","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":2779,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-20 19:22:53","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-20 17:22:53","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A home-built device travels downstream to explore the limits of digital representation and the possibilities of uncertain knowledge. <\/span><\/p>\n  <p>The Anthropocene highlights the limitations of existing frameworks in terms of data collection and analysis with the suggestion that researchers across disciplinary fields have run up against the limits of the knowable. This has been revealed in a number of ways, including an inadequacy in existing techniques to analyze a changing and uncertain future, challenges to the way in which researchers frame human activities relative to environmental transformation, and the politics that inform how and what questions can be asked. How are the artists and researchers associated with the project <em>Mississippi. An Anthropocene River<\/em> engaged in explorations of the limits of the knowable, and what role does the concept of the Anthropocene have in prompting such questioning? This project tests experimentally how data is collected and gathered using a home-built device that will accompany artist John Kim on his journey downriver.<\/p>\n <p>The Mississippi River is one of the most heavily monitored and studied river systems in the world. The United States Geological Survey, the Army Corps of Engineers, the National Weather Service, along with numerous NGOs contribute to the collection and interpretation of the river across a variety of environmental and hydrologic parameters. This data plays a central role in constructing ways of sensing and understanding the river, the impact of human activities on it, and efforts to manage it. The collection and interpretation of this data sits at the intersection of a number of technoscientific developments, including computational modeling and simulation techniques, quantitative thinking, and disaster prediction, among others.<\/p>\n<p>In light of the changes associated with the Anthropocene, one can also recognize how data exists as a constraint\u2014for it delimits the horizon of the sensible. Data conceals just as it reveals. This project takes the Mississippi River as a case study for these concerns, as many of the projects involved in <em>Mississippi. An Anthropocene River<\/em> concern the collection of data. How do researchers understand the river in relationship to the data collected about it? How does the omission or failure to collect uncertain forms of knowledge constrain what we know about the river? How are researchers engaging in new and expanded modes of data collection in order to challenge prevailing sentiments about the river and its history and future? This project will engage in conversations with the diverse group of researchers, activists, public officials, and artists participating in the project <em>Mississippi. An Anthropocene River<\/em> about their work on the river, focusing on how data is integral to the process of forming knowledge about the river, and examining the limits of digital representations of the environment.<\/p>\n<p>As we make our way down the Mississippi River from Lake Itasca to New Orleans, participants in the <em>River Journey<\/em> will also be collecting and contributing environmental, hydrologic, and travel data, including water quality, flow, kinetics, temperature, and other parameters. This data will not only serve as a chronicle of the changes as we move downstream but will also be shared with a group of researchers who will be using it for basic scientific analysis and teaching. Along the way, we will lure some of these researchers and educators into conversations about this project; this series of conversations and interviews will seek to convey both the process of doing science about the Mississippi River and the construction of its representation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jkim5\/miss-canoe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github repository for the project<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediaculturalstudies.com\/miss-canoe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data sensing CSV archive<\/a><\/p>\n","post_title":"Data Sensing","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"data-sensing","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-07-03 15:31:39","post_modified_gmt":"2020-07-03 13:31:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2775,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2779","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}],"methods":[{"term_id":13,"name":"Monitoring","slug":"monitoring","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":13,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":33,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":2,"name":"Sensing","slug":"sensing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":85,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":10,"name":"Field Work","slug":"field-work","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":10,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":152,"filter":"raw"}],"keywords":[{"term_id":197,"name":"Data","slug":"data","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":197,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":30,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":202,"name":"Ecology","slug":"ecology","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":202,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":75,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":250,"name":"Pollution","slug":"pollution","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":250,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":30,"filter":"raw"}],"folksonomy":[{"term_id":287,"name":"Geochemistry","slug":"geochemistry","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":287,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":7,"filter":"raw"}]},"author_name":"Christoph Rosol","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/12724"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/26"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/12724\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25249,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/12724\/revisions\/25249"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12724"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=12724"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=12724"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=12724"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
