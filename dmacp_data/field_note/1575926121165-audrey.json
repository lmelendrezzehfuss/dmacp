Another one touting the phrase: \u201cNO SMOKING, CONSERVE ENERGY, PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT\u201d. There is obvious irony wrapped up into these mantras that are carried up and down the river for whatever reason. I wondered if they put these onto the ships to cover some legal obligation, or if it was in a genuine self-serving way to remind themselves that if they ruin the environment then there would be no more environment for them to continue to ruin, or if it was just as much of a hilarious contradiction to them as it was to me. I ended up with the conclusion that it made no sense to me no matter which reason they chose, but that it did make a nice post for the Field Notes App.<br \/>\r\n","latitude":"30.104755555555556","longitude":"-90.95641388888889","location":"Aben, Louisiana, USA","media":{"ID":16395,"id":16395,"title":"IMG_2121.jpg","filename":"IMG_2121.jpg","filesize":575600,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/field_note\/1575926121165-audrey\/img_2121-jpg\/","alt":"","author":"47","description":"","caption":"","name":"img_2121-jpg","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":16396,"date":"2019-12-09 21:15:17","modified":"2019-12-09 21:15:22","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2016,"height":1512,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121-768x576.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":576,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121-300x225.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":225,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121-768x576.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":576,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121-1400x1050.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":1050,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1152,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121.jpg","2048x2048-width":2016,"2048x2048-height":1512,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_2121-1600x1200.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1200}},"linked_projects":false,"methods":false,"keywords":false,"folksonomy":false},"author_name":"Audrey","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/16396"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/47"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/16396\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25532,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/16396\/revisions\/25532"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=16396"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=16396"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=16396"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=16396"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
