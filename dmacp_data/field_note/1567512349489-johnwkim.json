We also recognize that the institutions with which we are linked have been complicit in the erasures of history and continue to benefit from and perpetuate processes of colonization, broken treaties, dispossession, and displacement. As a project, Field Station 1, is producing art and scholarship about the Mississippi River with the material resources and in the facilities of institutions of European power and settlement, including land grant universities. We work to educate ourselves, our campuses and communities about this complex history and its contemporary manifestations. Responding to these considerations, Field Station 1 endeavored to work collaboratively and critically with a diverse group of participants from the outset. We also organized a number of activities in the headwaters region of the Mississippi River during the Kickoff (August 27\u201329, 2019) as a practice of land acknowledgement to open the Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project. These conversations continue in the Driftless at Field Station 2 (September 25\u201329, 2019), where issues concerning settler colonialism, racial capitalism, and Indigenous resurgence are engaged. We hope that these practices continue further downriver and throughout the project.<br \/>\r\nAnya Kaplan-Seem and John Kim for Field Station 1<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPhoto caption: Coffee Pot Landing near Lake Itasca with Dawn Goodwin and Jamie Gaither.

This stretch of the Mississippi River marks both its \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201canthropogenic\u201d origin, where a small creek becomes a continental torrent, where the Dakota, Ojibwe, and many other native peoples centered their material and spiritual lives, and where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has pursued its mandate to organize, manage, and direct the river\u2019s flow for almost two centuries.<\/p>\n <p>Along the Upper Mississippi River, engineering has taken the form of extensive infrastructural interventions into the river, including the building of 29 locks and dams and ongoing dredging to maintain a nine-foot deep navigation channel for ships carrying agricultural and industrial products. These interventions have been figured as projects of control, demonstrative of expertise and the power of humans to govern nature. Field Station 1 begins from the premise that past infrastructural interventions into the Mississippi River as well as proposed future projects are better understood as experiments, ones engaged under conditions of uncertainty and therefore inherently speculative.<\/p>\n<p>The region including the headwaters is an expansive tapestry of lakes, marshes, streams and rivers consisting of native lands, state parks, a large urban conglomeration, and rural municipalities. Understanding the Mississippi River as a site of speculations recognizes it to be a space of power. Field Station 1 connects projects and initiatives that conceptualize the Mississippi as a site of experimentation, speculation, and ongoing struggle in order to think about the communities, places, materials, creatures, interventions and imaginations that coalesce or disperse around the river. It asks who gets to experiment with the river; how experimentation figures into larger projects of state-building, social justice, and self-determination; how climate change can affect local decision-making; and how the flow of the river links upriver and downriver in complex and nonlinear ways. Field Station 1 reflects on the region as assemblage, characterized by overlapping experiences of space, time, water, land, precarity, opportunity, and possibility across multispecies relations. In so doing, it invites creative engagement with diverse experiences of the region.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","post_title":"Field Station 1: Sediment, Settlement, Sentiment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"field-station-1-sediment-settlement-sentiment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-02 12:17:15","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-02 11:17:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":579,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=1247","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}],"methods":false,"keywords":false,"folksonomy":false},"author_name":"johnwkim","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/7713"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/7713\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25679,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/7713\/revisions\/25679"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7713"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=7713"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=7713"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=7713"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
