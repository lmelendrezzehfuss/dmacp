Here, the Mississippi River is a hydraulic cleave through a territory that is rife with contradiction: once the meeting point of the tribes of the Osage and the Illinois, the Cahokia and the Missouri; once a boundary between empires; once a line between the free and the enslaved; still a real and conceptual divide to collective imagination and action. Along this river, which troubles the totalizing binaries of corporations and individuals, environmental devastation and renewal, rural and urban geography, distant past and uncertain present, these latent histories and liminal boundaries rise to the surface and resist any form of clean analysis, any easy narrative closure.<\/p>\n <p><em>Anthropocene Vernacular<\/em>\u00a0foregrounds the ways that the rewriting of human geo-logics is not simply something out there\u2014in the spectacularly disturbing landscapes that have come to signify our contemporary anthropocenic epoch\u2014but, rather, is deeply interwoven right here, in the decisions, assumptions, and textures of everyday life. Artists, researchers, and community organizers will share through a series of projects the multigenerational story of how this region\u2019s people have cultivated an embodied, everyday culture in the midst of the intense convergence of social, environmental, and economic crises.

Federal Election Commission<\/em> US Supreme Court ruling, establishing corporate personhood. Ironically, in the midst of acknowledged and visible environmental crisis, and during a political moment upholding the notion that \u201ccorporations are people,\u201d Monsanto operates in an echelon with few placed, individual stories and particulars on which to grasp.<\/p>\n<p>Though its impact is felt globally, the story of Monsanto is a local one. Through archival research and conversations with the community in the village of Sauget, Illinois (initially founded as the industrial suburb of Monsanto in 1926), this project seeks to create the conditions for Sauget residents to tell their side of the story about corporate personhood. Equally, it is an opening up of a space to consider how the Anthropocene is embodied within the everyday activities of the community\u2019s people and landscape; an initial step toward building the platform that will enable the stories and histories of the Anthropocene to be heard and shared in the vernacular across both sides of the Mississippi River. The Monsanto project will culminate in a day of public conversations and a cookout with Sauget residents and their counterparts across the American Bottom.<\/p>\n<p><em>Monsanto Town<\/em> seeks to mark the gaps in these overlays through an attention to the everyday life and cultural landscapes of Sauget, as well as archival research into the labor culture at Monsanto\u2019s facilities before public association with PCB production necessitated the change in name in 1977. By combining research with an engaged, multidisciplinary approach to fieldwork, this project will balance the historical, economic, and environmental account of the past and continuing, hazardous, present, of Monsanto Town with confounding points of dissonance and similarity present in the everyday contemporary cultural landscape of Sauget. Through activating both of these methods, this project will locate how, contrary to the popular mythos of this industrial suburb, a rich narrative of one of the epicenters of the Anthropocene can be powerfully understood through its vernacular practices, people, and places \u2013 as well as its more obvious smoke stacks and Superfund sites.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Monsanto Town","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"monsanto-town","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-09-30 17:21:35","post_modified_gmt":"2019-09-30 15:21:35","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2716","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":3464,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-22 10:20:52","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-22 08:20:52","post_content":"<p>Temporary<em> continent.<\/em> maps the unstable tributaries of contributions and reflections arising from the research procession down the river.<\/p>\n  <p>Temporary <em>continent.<\/em> maps the unstable tributaries of contributions, reflections, and media arising from <em>Mississippi.
