It epitomizes the many vernacular contours of the Anthropocene and, at the same time, reconfigurates them towards a global meshwork of teleconnected consequences. Marking a decisive shift from a tributary to a distributary system, the unique geography of the delta and its \u201cthick\u201d locality represents both the acme of the Anthropocene River, as well as its outflow into the global sphere of open waters. It exemplifies as much a local Anthropocene topography as it draws out a global topology of Anthropocene bearings and relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Synthesizing the findings of the <em>Field Stations<\/em>, the <em>Anthropocene River Campus: The Human Delta<\/em> unfolds key themes\u2014ranging from the flow of commodities, river engineering, and risk and equity to clashing Anthropocene temporalities, claims to property and access, and the stark reality of spiritual and material exhaustion\u2014and investigates them locally in and around the delta.
