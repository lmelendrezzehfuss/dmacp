Students of the Augsburg University\u2019s <em>River Semester <\/em>and twenty-five scholars, artists, and activists from around the world bring together the findings and practices of the individual field stations and collect their own observational research, making connections with local people along the way. Participants will use their <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em> online pages to collect the research and draw it into a common narrative depicting the downstream connections of the river system, engaging ongoing debates on how to react to, cope, and deal with the effects of the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n <p>How do we travel through the Anthropocene? This question is not only an ecologically ethical one\u2014being directly related to processes of resource depletion and fossil fuel extraction\u2014but also has an aesthetically conceptual dimension. Previously, travel anticipated the unknown\u2014a \u201cforeignness\u201d\u2014which the traveler or travelers familiarized themselves with and appropriated. In the Anthropocene, where a limitless interweaving of humankind, nature, technology, and economics replaces the white patches of terra incognita, this logic runs into nothingness. But what travel routes, forms of travel, and narratives are suitable for the new planetary realities? And how could travel be understood as a cultural technique of relating to something rather than as a process of appropriation?<\/p>\n<p>These are the prerequisites under which students, scientists, artists, journalists, and authors explore the Mississippi in an <em>Anthropocene River Journey<\/em>. Calling in at the five Field stations along the river, travelers develop and test new types of access to the complexity of the Anthropocene river system in talks, lectures, and excursions. At some stages, they are accompanied by students from Augsburg University, Minneapolis, who, as part of the <em>River Semester<\/em>, are covering the entire length of the Mississippi River\u2014from the source regions in the north to the Gulf of Mexico\u2014in canoes and vans in about eighty days. In experimental seminars on ecology, political science, biology, art, astronomy, and history, they are seeking answers to the challenges of the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Anthropocene River Journey","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"anthropocene-river-journey","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-05 14:50:53","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-05 12:50:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":8,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2775","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":8887,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2019-09-11 16:49:49","post_date_gmt":"2019-09-11 14:49:49","post_content":"<p>Ancient agricultural practices in the American Bottom were significant in the shaping of the landscapes and foodscapes that exist today.<\/p>\n  <p>The <em>Postnatural Landscapes<\/em> project presents a visible, materially enacted practice that \u201cmakes edible\u201d thousands of years of human intervention and reveals the massive transformation of the Earth.

That is to say, through seeds, we can date the beginning of a preferential system for plant selection and domestication in relation to human settlements in the American Bottom region. Archeologic evidence points to at least five native plants, known as lost crops, as the foundation for unique local agro-ecosystems in the area. Yet \u201czeacentrism\u201d\u2014the focus on maize as the enabler of (North American) civilization\u2014has largely eclipsed this significant period of our agricultural heritage. In fact, these lost crops were likely to have been cultivated alongside maize, some surviving, and developing into landraces we recognize today like sunflowers and squash. During the Mississippian era\u2014over 1,000 years ago, and up to the influence of the colonial-era\u2014most communities in Eastern North America adopted maize agriculture, which experienced a morphological evolution while vigorously integrating into landscape cultivation and cultural consumption. Furthermore, within the last 200 years, we see yet another dominant wave of human-influenced production through the ongoing standardization and ubiquity of monocultures that have come to define our contemporary landscapes of production. Research in this area enables us to chart the changes through time, indexing progressive rhythms of what has been lost and gained through postnatural and human ecologies, and to arrive at the industrialized agricultural landscapes of the present.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Postnatural Landscapes","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"postnatural-landscapes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-06-17 09:58:41","post_modified_gmt":"2020-06-17 07:58:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=8887","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":3418,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-21 16:08:21","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 14:08:21","post_content":"<p>Focusing on the limits\u2014and opportunities\u2014exhaustion engenders, in this seminar the difficulties of being out of energy and out of ideas will be related to the challenges posed by the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n  <p>Ideas, people, and ecosystems all have their limits. In a seminar that confronts the difficulties of being out of energy and out of ideas, participants will negotiate the many limits the Anthropocene confronts us with and how this has a severe effect on how we understand and exist within it. The way that this exhaustion can also mark the cessation of practices and approaches that are no longer fit for purpose will also be explored.<\/p>\n <p>A foundational issue in studying the effects of climate change is the possibility of exhaustion; of resources, of ways of life, of species, the oxygen starved \u201cdead\u201d hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet the exhaustion can also indicate the end point of some practices that have become less useful\u2014or even ways of life that were not so compelling in the first place. It could also account for the effective exhaustion of communities or activist groups trying to battle global issues and sustain ways of living in an increasingly vulnerable state. By visiting multiple sites downriver from Tulane University, this seminar will explore the roles of exhaustion and imagination as pertaining to ongoing ecological, cultural, and historical figurations in the area. Exhaustion and imagination will be viewed as concurrent themes that inform each other by decoding the many layers of anthropogenic behaviors expressed upon and within the landscape.<\/p>\n<p>One site that will be focused on during the seminar is a disappearing parcel of land in Plaquemines Parish, outside the federal levee protection system and south of the soon to be constructed Breton Sound sediment diversion. It is heritage of a legacy of generations connected to this river land, descendants of an ethnic European man and an enslaved woman. Those involved with the seminar will take on differing perspectives concerning this parcel of land and how its geomorphological transformations play into the themes of the seminar while also discussing philosophies of ownership and its relation to place. Other sites of exploration will include geological remnants of deltaic lobe building and sites that reveal current practices surrounding river constriction and diversion measures in the parishes of Orleans and Saint Bernard.<\/p>\n<p>Seminar participants will be in-situ to observe, sense, listen, and interact with a complex accumulation of anthropogenic layers at multiple scales throughout time. These sites will serve as test cases to understand local permutations of macro issues pertaining to planetary changes, commodity chains, infrastructural and ecological metabolism, and the duration and temporality of these systems, with a particular focus on the exhaustion of land, water, and the body.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Exhaustion and Imagination","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-exhaustion-and-imagination","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-05 14:48:15","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-05 12:48:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":3396,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=3418","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}],"methods":[{"term_id":3,"name":"Storytelling","slug":"storytelling","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":143,"filter":"raw"}],"keywords":[{"term_id":200,"name":"Disaster","slug":"disaster","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":200,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":20,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":228,"name":"Imaginary","slug":"imaginary","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":228,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":29,"filter":"raw"}],"folksonomy":[{"term_id":351,"name":"Car","slug":"car","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":351,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"}]},"author_name":"underhil","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14520"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/17"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14520\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25535,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14520\/revisions\/25535"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=14520"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=14520"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=14520"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=14520"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
