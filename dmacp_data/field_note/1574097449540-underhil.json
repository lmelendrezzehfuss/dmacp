An aesthetics of displacement, as it relates to bodies of water, runs through each of the works. The artists participating in the residency were selected on account of their pre-existing practices that entail a critical envisioning of the Mississippi River and\/or an assessment of the environmental impacts of human activities on bodies of water. A common theme in the artists\u2019 work is an aesthetics of displacement.<\/p>\n <p><u>1<\/u><\/p>\n<p>Looking down on St. Anthony Falls from the walls of the lock and dam infrastructure, one can marvel at this feat of technical engineering. The river runs over an artificial concrete platform creating the Falls. The lock with its giant metal gates holds back millions of gallons of water. It is a triumph of modern engineering and architecture, built for commercial river traffic in pursuit of profit and progress.<\/p>\n<p>The lock is now closed; its gates welded shut. Today, when standing atop the lock and dam, one cannot help but reflect critically on its existence as a monument to a different time, a pre-climate change past. During a spring season that has witnessed extensive flooding up and down the Mississippi River, one cannot help but worry about its inadequacy and anticipate failure.<\/p>\n<p><u>2<\/u><\/p>\n<p>In its current obsolescence, the aged lock and dam infrastructure is a monument to a dark history. Built into its hard structures is the historical legacy of a technic for the displacement of material, non-humans, and human communities. Its presence speaks to the violence of forced movement and dislocation. In a material sense, a dam is engineered to displace water, to hold it back and redirect its flow. The concrete walls and embankments are fortified barriers for keeping nature at bay. The dam is a military technology as well. It shares a history with the berm, which acts as a human breakwater, a defensive technology for the displacement and separation of groups of people.<\/p>\n<p><u>3<\/u><\/p>\n<p>Over the past six months, four artists have developed new short films inspired by our field station&#8217;s approach to <em>Mississippi.

They were selected because of pre-existing practices that involved a critical envisioning of the Mississippi River and\/or an assessment of the environmental impacts of human activities on bodies of water. A common theme in the artists&#8217; work is an aesthetics of displacement. Andrea Carlson\u2019s site-specific short film, <em>The Uncompromising Hand <\/em>(2017), revisits Spirit Island, a sacred site to multiple Indigenous communities that was once in the Mississippi River near the current lock and dam. Tia-Simone Gardner\u2019s <em>Reading the River: Yemaya and Oshun<\/em> (2018) is an experimental documentary set in port cities along the Lower Mississippi River and reflects on Blackness in relation to geography, architecture, and a feminist practice of unsettling how we think and know place. Jenny Schmid\u2019s prints, including <em>The Last Tree Huggers <\/em>(2017) and <em>Momento Mare <\/em>(2017) feature monstrous creatures who make an uneasy home in the environmental ruin of a disastrous present. John Kim&#8217;s piece, <em>Dam, Lock, Groyne: The Temporal Architecture of the Mississippi River<\/em> (2019) is a reflection on the hard structures and earthworks found along the entire length of the Mississippi River that displace water, people, and non-human species.

This seminar engages the complicated entanglements of property claims that cut across the social, racial, and ecological landscapes of the Mississippi Delta, while connecting them to upriver struggles, as well as to the meaning of the Anthropocene itself.<\/p>\n <p>The practices of controlling land and water inherent to property ownership are also tools of the Anthropocene, the effects of which intersect historical and contemporary conflicts over land and property down the length of the Mississippi. This is particularly true in the Delta, where flooding, intrusion, and efforts to reclaim land can\u2019t be separated from the attachments, needs, and claims of specific communities. This seminar examines claims to land amid the shifting registers of property within an intertidal landscape, where fluid dynamics of river and tide literally undermine land through processes that necessitate constant engineering and vigilance.<\/p>\n<p>Capital also exerts deterritorializing force on communities throughout the Delta as slow violence: real estate speculation triggers gentrification and displacement; petro-chemicals migrate into marginalized frontline bodies; ecosystems degrade. Such slippages between land, property, capital, and claims result in a contested ground where definitions and designations shift, impacted by tidal cycles of neoliberal governance; buffered by community organizing, agency, and resistance. In this destabilized environment, who claims care for particular lands, on what basis, and how? How do legacies of settler colonialism and slavery live on in property claims, conflicts, and contradictions? What role does (anthropogenic) environmental change play in casting property\/ownership into a different light? Conversely, are there risks in moving \u201cbeyond\u201d property when marginalized communities claim land as property in the face of dispossession? As with any effort to locate an \u201cotherwise\u201d in or to the present, who is empowered to do so is often unequal and how we ask questions is never innocent.<\/p>\n<p>The seminar is structured around critical site visits in and around New Orleans that magnify contestations over the designation, control, or condition of land. It is informed by local researchers and activists, beginning with the Geographies of Black Displacement tour led by convener Shana M. griffin. This brings into view post-Katrina gentrification and black displacement; the paradox of real estate capital flooding into an area threatened by sea-level rise; a perspective aligning climate change, property, race, and class.<\/p>\n<p>Subsequently, a field visit with the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe (PACIT) will take the seminar about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans, deep in the bayous and swamplands of unclear and rapidly changing boundaries between land and water along the coast. Geneva Lebeouf, Christine Verdin, and PACIT members will guide an exploration down Island Road to the thin strip of land where the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe are facing the existential threat and urgency of sea-level rise that is causing them to consider the loaded possibility of relocating from their ancestral lands. Over a meal together, generously prepared by Tribal members at the PACIT Community Center, the region will be reflected together and experiences of rapid land loss, subsidence, the impacts of oil and gas industries, and strategies of adaptation to these changes in the landscape and frequent flooding events will be discussed.<\/p>\n<p>These shifting landscapes of inundation and chemical trespass, as well as zones of multi-species inhabitation, serve as a provocation to (private) property\u2019s political and economic organizing principle and to the liberal sense of self (\u201cproperty in self\u201d). The final session provides opportunity to develop imaginative scenarios and potential forms of resistance rooted in the nuances of situations observed.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Claims\/Property","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-claims-property","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-08-10 12:34:49","post_modified_gmt":"2020-08-10 10:34:49","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":3396,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=3410","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":4959,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2019-08-29 10:53:58","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-29 08:53:58","post_content":" Floating into the Post-Anthropocene <p><em>Aerocene<\/em> is an open-source artistic project initiated by Studio Tom\u00e1s Saraceno.
