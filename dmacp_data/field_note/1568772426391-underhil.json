In a seminar that confronts the difficulties of being out of energy and out of ideas, participants will negotiate the many limits the Anthropocene confronts us with and how this has a severe effect on how we understand and exist within it. The way that this exhaustion can also mark the cessation of practices and approaches that are no longer fit for purpose will also be explored.<\/p>\n <p>A foundational issue in studying the effects of climate change is the possibility of exhaustion; of resources, of ways of life, of species, the oxygen starved \u201cdead\u201d hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet the exhaustion can also indicate the end point of some practices that have become less useful\u2014or even ways of life that were not so compelling in the first place. It could also account for the effective exhaustion of communities or activist groups trying to battle global issues and sustain ways of living in an increasingly vulnerable state. By visiting multiple sites downriver from Tulane University, this seminar will explore the roles of exhaustion and imagination as pertaining to ongoing ecological, cultural, and historical figurations in the area. Exhaustion and imagination will be viewed as concurrent themes that inform each other by decoding the many layers of anthropogenic behaviors expressed upon and within the landscape.<\/p>\n<p>One site that will be focused on during the seminar is a disappearing parcel of land in Plaquemines Parish, outside the federal levee protection system and south of the soon to be constructed Breton Sound sediment diversion. It is heritage of a legacy of generations connected to this river land, descendants of an ethnic European man and an enslaved woman. Those involved with the seminar will take on differing perspectives concerning this parcel of land and how its geomorphological transformations play into the themes of the seminar while also discussing philosophies of ownership and its relation to place. Other sites of exploration will include geological remnants of deltaic lobe building and sites that reveal current practices surrounding river constriction and diversion measures in the parishes of Orleans and Saint Bernard.<\/p>\n<p>Seminar participants will be in-situ to observe, sense, listen, and interact with a complex accumulation of anthropogenic layers at multiple scales throughout time. These sites will serve as test cases to understand local permutations of macro issues pertaining to planetary changes, commodity chains, infrastructural and ecological metabolism, and the duration and temporality of these systems, with a particular focus on the exhaustion of land, water, and the body.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Exhaustion and Imagination","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-exhaustion-and-imagination","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2021-02-08 13:18:09","post_modified_gmt":"2021-02-08 12:18:09","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":3396,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=3418","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":2755,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-20 18:43:01","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-20 16:43:01","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From opioid to the Anthropocene: a video project on addiction as the substantial mode of our existence<\/span><\/p>\n  <p>By placing the contemporary US opioid crisis in the context of overlapping systems\u2014political, material, industrial\u2014Beate Geissler and Oliver Sann\u2019s video practice reveals the complex web of interrelations that underpin individual addiction.

The work traces the origins of the situation beyond simply addiction and dereliction, instead revealing how this cycle of dependency, depression, and despair arises from a nexus of factors playing out over public health systems, rural\/ urban divides, and pharmaceutical industries, encompassing racial tensions, colonialized monopoly and processes of deindustrialization. The project also intends to challenge the way we conceive substance dependencies and their history, by regarding addiction as a substantial mode of our existence, and as the possible core of our relationship to the planet. Taking this notion further, substance dependency can be regarded as not only a metaphor, but the very essence of our incapacity to respond to the demand for changes in the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Hopium Economy","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"hopium-economy","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-09-16 16:43:52","post_modified_gmt":"2019-09-16 14:43:52","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":1393,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2755","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}],"methods":[{"term_id":6,"name":"Modeling","slug":"modeling","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":6,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":17,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":10,"name":"Field Work","slug":"field-work","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":10,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":150,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":13,"name":"Monitoring","slug":"monitoring","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":13,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":33,"filter":"raw"}],"keywords":[{"term_id":322,"name":"Settler Colonialism","slug":"settlercolonialism","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":322,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":45,"filter":"raw"}],"folksonomy":[{"term_id":304,"name":"Overburden","slug":"overburden","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":304,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":315,"name":"Substances","slug":"substances","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":315,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":316,"name":"Colonialism","slug":"colonialism","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":316,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":17,"filter":"raw"}]},"author_name":"underhil","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/11141"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/17"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/11141\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25230,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/11141\/revisions\/25230"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=11141"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=11141"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=11141"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=11141"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
