An Anthropocene River<\/em> aims to make the Mississippi River Basin legible as a zone of ecological, historical, and social interaction between humans and the environment using novel forms of exchange, research, collaboration, and pedagogy.<\/p>\n  <p>The Mississippi region presents a remarkable landscape for understanding the rapid shift into what scientists and humanists are calling the Anthropocene\u2014the geological epoch of humankind. Over the course of a year, <em>Mississippi.

Barely a river but more of a floodplain before, it was massively dredged in the 20th century. Its ecology has evolved as a constantly shifting ecosystem, a catchment of cultures, a dividing line, a water highway for resources and goods, and a sink for pollutants. From the logging and mining zones in the Upper River area to the high technology and petrochemical centers in the Delta; from the industrial agricultural landscapes of the Midwest to the \u201cdead zones\u201d in the Gulf of Mexico; from the historic transportation network enabling the egregious trade of human forced labor to the social injustices of poverty and deindustrialization today\u2014the Mississippi is a symptom and object of investigation for the radical impact humans inflict on the Earth.<\/p>\n<p><em>Mississippi.
