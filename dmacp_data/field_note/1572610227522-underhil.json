This research project sheds light on the lesser known origins and history of the petro-industry.<\/p>\n<div class=\"icons\"><\/div>\n  <p>Hydrocarbons not only play a driving role as an enabler of mobility, but the refineries of the petro-industry, which clusters around Baton Rouge, are also a catalyst of anthropocenic transformation processes of planetary scale. But where lie the origins of petrochemistry and what is its history?<\/p>\n <p>Baton Rouge is home to one of the biggest refineries in the United States and in the world. This chemical complex produces over 300 products, adding up to a general output of more than 500,000 barrels daily. This alone would qualify it as a perfect site to read as a contribution to<em> Mississippi. An Anthropocene River<\/em>, because petrochemistry is one of the most important drivers of anthropocenic change. Furthermore, this particular chemical process landscape is a \u201cNational Historic Chemical Landmark\u201d and a historic site of German\u2013American scientific cooperation.<br \/>\nThe refinement and chemical synthesis of fuels, ammunition, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and plastics have fundamentally altered the human condition and the very functions of the planetary biosphere. Chemistry, the science of processes, has produced substances that have altered the natural and cultural evolution of the planet, resulting in unprecedented mobility, chemically fuelled wars, organismic extinction, and economic and population growth. Raw materials have not driven the \u201cGreat Acceleration,\u201d but as Baton Rouge shows, it was the work of industrial chemistry and the use of catalysts that helped bring about the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n<p>The prehistory of petrochemistry lies in nitrogen chemistry. Since the invention of the Haber-Bosch process in around 1910, the impact of the German chemical industry has had planetary significance. The catalytic synthesis of ammonia has vastly amplified the planet\u2019s metabolism by producing abundant fertilizer and changed warfare by producing abundant ammunition. Furthermore, it provided the technical platform for hydrocarbon synthesis and petrochemistry.<\/p>\n<p>In Baton Rouge, the German chemical company BASF (IG Farben) has closely cooperated with the New Jersey-based Standard Oil Company since the 1920s. German efforts to replace oil with synthetic fuels derived from hydrogenated coal, and advancements on the technical platform brought these companies together. In the late 1920s, when the complexity of the task threatened the German project, the Americans stepped in. Close scientific cooperation began, with asset swaps and joint laboratory work between Germany and America, resulting in important advances in petrochemical research, poignantly just before they became combatants in the Second World War.<\/p>\n<p>The development of the major chemical compounds of modern warfare, from aviation fuel to synthetic rubber and toluene used for explosives, took place on the new industrial platform of catalytic petrochemistry. In particular, the high-octane fuels used in military aircraft depended on new molecular technology derived from German coal chemistry. With considerable irony, Germany lost the war in part as the result of America\u2019s use of German chemistry. Since the conflict, petrochemistry has become a planetary force, enabling unparalleled mobility, whilst the Ziegler-Natta process, also of German origins, enabled the abundance of plastics that now pollute the Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Near the estuary of a vast hydrological basin, the refineries of Baton Rouge are one source of the flood of petrochemical goods that enter the planetary system. Understood as heart chambers of the Anthropocene, refineries drive the outputs of industry and have manifold effects on ecological metabolisms and climatic patterns. The hydrocarbon industries share the same technological basis as nitrogen chemistry and both are grounded in the production of ammunition and fertilizers. Even the soil-enriching side of this dichotomy shows a destructive tendency in Louisiana, as over-fertilization of the Mississippi Valley has created large eutrophic dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>This project will involve interviews with practitioners, historians, and archivists as well as a visit to Baton Rouge, where the site will be approached as a paradigmatic place in which coal chemistry and petrochemistry, as well as German and American science and industry, met, changing not only the flow of political and cultural history but planetary history as well.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Baton Rouge: A Process Landscape at the Confluence of German-American Chemistry","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"baton-rouge-a-process-landscape-at-the-confluence-of-german-american-chemistry","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-08-03 10:24:05","post_modified_gmt":"2020-08-03 08:24:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2775,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=3512","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":3493,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-08-22 11:41:55","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-22 09:41:55","post_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can the history of slavery tell us about the future of the Anthropocene?<\/span><\/p>\n Slavery, Memory and Justice along the Mississippi <p>Jason Ludwig\u2019s Traveler Project draws from the extensive research he has conducted into the history of American slavery as it intersects with the Anthropocene.

This seminar engages the complicated entanglements of property claims that cut across the social, racial, and ecological landscapes of the Mississippi Delta, while connecting them to upriver struggles, as well as to the meaning of the Anthropocene itself.<\/p>\n <p>The practices of controlling land and water inherent to property ownership are also tools of the Anthropocene, the effects of which intersect historical and contemporary conflicts over land and property down the length of the Mississippi. This is particularly true in the Delta, where flooding, intrusion, and efforts to reclaim land can\u2019t be separated from the attachments, needs, and claims of specific communities. This seminar examines claims to land amid the shifting registers of property within an intertidal landscape, where fluid dynamics of river and tide literally undermine land through processes that necessitate constant engineering and vigilance.<\/p>\n<p>Capital also exerts deterritorializing force on communities throughout the Delta as slow violence: real estate speculation triggers gentrification and displacement; petro-chemicals migrate into marginalized frontline bodies; ecosystems degrade. Such slippages between land, property, capital, and claims result in a contested ground where definitions and designations shift, impacted by tidal cycles of neoliberal governance; buffered by community organizing, agency, and resistance. In this destabilized environment, who claims care for particular lands, on what basis, and how? How do legacies of settler colonialism and slavery live on in property claims, conflicts, and contradictions? What role does (anthropogenic) environmental change play in casting property\/ownership into a different light? Conversely, are there risks in moving \u201cbeyond\u201d property when marginalized communities claim land as property in the face of dispossession? As with any effort to locate an \u201cotherwise\u201d in or to the present, who is empowered to do so is often unequal and how we ask questions is never innocent.<\/p>\n<p>The seminar is structured around critical site visits in and around New Orleans that magnify contestations over the designation, control, or condition of land. It is informed by local researchers and activists, beginning with the Geographies of Black Displacement tour led by convener Shana M. griffin. This brings into view post-Katrina gentrification and black displacement; the paradox of real estate capital flooding into an area threatened by sea-level rise; a perspective aligning climate change, property, race, and class.<\/p>\n<p>Subsequently, a field visit with the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe (PACIT) will take the seminar about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans, deep in the bayous and swamplands of unclear and rapidly changing boundaries between land and water along the coast. Geneva Lebeouf, Christine Verdin, and PACIT members will guide an exploration down Island Road to the thin strip of land where the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe are facing the existential threat and urgency of sea-level rise that is causing them to consider the loaded possibility of relocating from their ancestral lands. Over a meal together, generously prepared by Tribal members at the PACIT Community Center, the region will be reflected together and experiences of rapid land loss, subsidence, the impacts of oil and gas industries, and strategies of adaptation to these changes in the landscape and frequent flooding events will be discussed.<\/p>\n<p>These shifting landscapes of inundation and chemical trespass, as well as zones of multi-species inhabitation, serve as a provocation to (private) property\u2019s political and economic organizing principle and to the liberal sense of self (\u201cproperty in self\u201d).

This seminar articulates how risk assessment and management are at the heart of environmental justice.<\/p>\n <p>The adverse risks to climate change and ecological degradation are never shared equally across the globe\u2014or even within a region. This seminar explores the paired concepts of risk and equity as expressed through the lived experiences of residents in the lower Mississippi River region, and the infrastructures of greater New Orleans. It brings the notions of the \u201cQuotidian Anthropocene\u201d and \u201cSlow Disaster\u201d to bear, thinking about industrialization and toxicity not merely as quantifiable events on a timeline, but as exceedingly slow processes of environmental and human stress, locating the effects in the everyday lives and coping strategies of communities that persist and resist. Participants will work with conveners to gain background knowledge about these ideas, and then apply the concepts to field experiences in conjunction with community partners. The conceptual application is only made viable through a commitment to the mutuality of partnership with community members and locally active health and land use experts. We will explore the scale and scope of (anti-)Anthropocene activism and the diverse ways of reacting to risk\/equity issues in Louisiana.<\/p>\n<p>Special care is taken to emphasize that participants will be working within pre-existing channels of mutuality and collaboration, focused on the work of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN) and the Louisiana Landmarks Society (LLS), among others. Rather than foster \u201ctoxic tourism,\u201d participants will deepen their facility with the Quotidian Anthropocene and Slow Disaster through the development of methods of local action\u2014working on a project that was launched in September through the activities of the New Orleans Anthropocene Field Campus. At this time, the project format is open-ended, but will revolve around the formation of a community archive and it is expected that participants may wish to remain active and engaged in the localized work and partnerships after the Campus ends. Two advance call-in seminars will introduce participants to the concepts and the partnered project before the November Campus convenes. In Louisiana, participants will engage in on-site work sessions with LEAN and LLS as well as \u201con-campus\u201d debrief and discussion sessions.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Seminar: Risk\/Equity","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-risk-equity","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2021-02-08 13:08:40","post_modified_gmt":"2021-02-08 12:08:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":3396,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=3412","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}],"methods":[{"term_id":4,"name":"Field Study","slug":"field-study","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":4,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":111,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":12,"name":"Intervention","slug":"intervention","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":12,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":32,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":335,"name":"Engagement","slug":"engagement","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":335,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":92,"filter":"raw"}],"keywords":[{"term_id":186,"name":"Carbon","slug":"carbon","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":186,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":189,"name":"Commodities","slug":"commodities","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":189,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":47,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":190,"name":"Complexity","slug":"complexity","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":190,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":47,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":207,"name":"Energy","slug":"energy","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":207,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":45,"filter":"raw"}],"folksonomy":[{"term_id":294,"name":"River journey","slug":"river-journey","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":294,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":14,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":362,"name":"Embodied research","slug":"embodiedresearch","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":362,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":377,"name":"refinery","slug":"refinery","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":377,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":9,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":378,"name":"Catalysis","slug":"catalysis","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":378,"taxonomy":"folksonomy","description":"","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw"}]},"author_name":"underhil","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14500"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/field_note"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/17"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14500\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25539,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/field_note\/14500\/revisions\/25539"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=14500"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/method?post=14500"},{"taxonomy":"keyword","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/keyword?post=14500"},{"taxonomy":"folksonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/folksonomy?post=14500"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
