We acknowledge the overlapping histories of this region, including the continuing conditions of stolen Indigenous land and power and the ongoing violences of racial slavery. We also recognize that the institutions with which we are linked have been complicit in the erasures of history and continue to benefit from and perpetuate processes of colonization, broken treaties, dispossession, and displacement. As a project, Field Station 1, is producing art and scholarship about the Mississippi River with the material resources and in the facilities of institutions of European power and settlement, including land grant universities. We work to educate ourselves, our campuses and communities about this complex history and its contemporary manifestations. Responding to these considerations, Field Station 1 endeavored to work collaboratively and critically with a diverse group of participants from the outset. We also organized a number of activities in the headwaters region of the Mississippi River during the Kickoff (August 27\u201329, 2019) as a practice of land acknowledgement to open the Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project. These conversations continue in the Driftless at Field Station 2 (September 25\u201329, 2019), where issues concerning settler colonialism, racial capitalism, and Indigenous resurgence are engaged.

St. Anthony Falls was the upper limit of commercial navigation on the Mississippi until two dams and a series of locks were built between 1948 and 1963 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The locks made commercial navigation possible above Minneapolis. At midnight on June 9, 2015, the Upper St. Anthony Falls lock was permanently closed by Section 2010 of \"H.R.3080 - Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014\" which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on June 10, 2014, and was required to be implemented \"Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment\" The closure is intended to stop the spread of invasive species, namely two types of Asian carp: bighead carp and silver carp. Minneapolis is once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.  Photo by Alicia Johnson. Text adapted from Wikipedia."

But to do so robs the millions who suffered in bondage of their full legacy... The expansion of slavery in the first eight decades after American independence drove the evolution and modernization of the United States. In the span of a single lifetime, the South grew from a narrow coastal strip of worn-out tobacco plantations to a continental cotton empire, and the United States grew into a modern, industrial, and capitalist economy.\""

Some of them had come all the way from Standing Rock. \"We're here because your water is in trouble,\" one of them told the crowd.  From that point in Pittsburgh, the Ohio - consistently ranked one of the most polluted rivers in America - meanders its way to the Mississippi. And the river is about to get even more polluted. There's a plastics boom in Appalachia, which depends on fracking, pipelines, and ethane cracker plants.

In the 1890s, the name of Congo Square \u2014 a meeting point in New Orleans where enslaved black people were granted the freedom to congregate, sing and drum \u2014 was changed to Beauregard Square as part of a large-scale campaign to enforce racial hierarchy, by valorizing those who fought for slavery. Local New Orleans author and historian Freddi Williams Evans successfully advocated to change the name of the area back to Congo Square in 2011."

        "text": "Anthropocene Bodies::Disability Justice::Crip Leadership  One of the frameworks that's been absent in our gathering is that of disability justice, and it impacts how we function as a community of inquiry--the questions we do and don't ask, the ways we interpret and digest information, and how we do or don't take our own and each other's physical and emotional needs (which capitalism/all related oppressions have taught us to view as irrelevant) into account.   I'm a survivor of a lot of harmful chemical exposures, including early childhood pesticides, and most recently the toxic orange smoke of the 2017 California wildfires, which left me with injured lungs. Yesterday, Tuesday, I spent the afternoon with my group in Cancer Alley, breathing extremely polluted air. Although I didn't feel sick at the time, I know it taxed my system. Today, when at least three members of our seminar lit up cigarettes within a few feet of me in the first moments of our walking tour, my body reacted with burning lung pain, difficulty breathing, nausea and headache. I had to go home.    Many hours later, my body is still in a flare up of symptoms, a common event for people with environmental illness, so I won't be able to make my group's journey to tribal lands tomorrow.  But I will participate from afar. I will follow the field notes threads (pictures, please!) but I think my most useful contribution will be to write about why disability justice is an essential framework to include in our collective work. I will also attempt a crash course on access/inclusion and how ablist assumptions about productivity, efficiency, affordability and the individual right to contaminate shared spaces have made the Campus an uneven playing field. My inability to attend tomorow's field trip is not a personal misfortune. It's an illustration. It's an anthropocenic event. Stay tuned.  Aurora  PS. Health is not on the list of keywords!

I find myself a bit stuck tonight. I hope that we can see the lingering and far reaching effects of racial capitalism and its relationship to the Anthropocene. I hope that we see the the racism and ableism within the environmental injustices we witness and participate in. I hope we see that New Orleans is here but that New Orleans is also everywhere."

What we are just passing in our canoes is a planetary reactor: nitrogen from the atmosphere is put together with hydrogen from natural gas from the lithosphere, to make the industrial biosphere grow faster. The production of artificial ammonia from the elements by help of an already artificial iron-kali-potash catalyst was high-tech in 1910. But it is still this process that makes industrial agriculture work.  From Donaldsonville nitrogen products are shipped into the world as we just see at the terminal of the plant. But even if they go upstream to fertilize the soy and corn belts, most of the industrial molecules would see the place of their production in Donaldsonville again, as they are washed from the fields into the rivers and thus into the Mississippi river flowing by."

People live there, just in the middle of what is the most dense collection of petrochemical storage tanks in a single community in the US! Is this a place for an Anthropocene discussion? Or would not just a reasonable state with laws from the Holocene that are just recognized by this Stone age industry, be enough to make this nightmare disappear?"

All the colorful commodities (pharmaceuticals, sugar cane, sediments, food, money\u2026) brought to the seminar are categorized and homogenized. It takes quite a while for everyone to fill out the forms, and it generates resistance. Why shall I write down my name here? Does anyone think, this category here could work?  Great! The more bureaucracy grinds, and the more we feel that, the better. All commodification starts with an imposition like this. There would be no transport of soy or cement or oil on the river without paperwork, and I imagine, real papers are even more crazy that ours!"

Another one touting the phrase: \u201cNO SMOKING, CONSERVE ENERGY, PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT\u201d. There is obvious irony wrapped up into these mantras that are carried up and down the river for whatever reason. I wondered if they put these onto the ships to cover some legal obligation, or if it was in a genuine self-serving way to remind themselves that if they ruin the environment then there would be no more environment for them to continue to ruin, or if it was just as much of a hilarious contradiction to them as it was to me. I ended up with the conclusion that it made no sense to me no matter which reason they chose, but that it did make a nice post for the Field Notes App."

I use a machine that measures the abundance of elements in bulk samples of soils and sediments and during some machine testing this week, I remembered I had this sample. The top figure is for trace elements in units of ppm (parts per million) and the lower one for major elements as % abundance. Major elements usually represent the dominant geology of a catchment (why not colour RWB, I thought) and trace elements the local geology (hence Choctaw flag colours). The size of the rectangles are proportional to the elements abundance. Sediment geochemistry, geopolitics and tribal entities are not very often combined."
