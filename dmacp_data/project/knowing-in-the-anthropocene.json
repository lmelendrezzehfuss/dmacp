Bronislaw Szerszynski opened the seminar by encouraging participants to exploit creative tensions and agonisms between different modes and ontologies of knowing. Melanie Sehgal used the work of Alfred North Whitehead to argue for the importance of challenging the modern \u201cbifurcation\u201d between subjective and objective domains of reality. Sasha Engelmann introduced artist Tom\u00e1s Saraceno\u2019s idea of the Aerocene\u2014a vision of a society with a transformed metabolic and thermodynamic relationship with both the atmosphere and the Sun. Saraceno also attended the seminar and organized a dawn launch of Aerosolar sculptures at Tempelhof airfield during the Campus. Janot Mendler de Suarez organized exercises designed to stimulate new modes of knowledge production, and Zoe Lucia L\u00fcthi introduced a case study on air-pollution movement in the Himalaya\u2012Tibetan Plateau region.<\/p>\n ","post_title":"Seminar Reflection: Knowing (in) the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-reflection","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-12 10:54:17","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-12 09:54:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contribution&#038;p=18269","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contribution","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/seminar-reflection\/","acf":{"thumbnail":false,"teaser_text":"<p>The Anthropocene presents us with a unique set of epistemological challenges.
