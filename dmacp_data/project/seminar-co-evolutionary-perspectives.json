J\u00fcrgen Renn. Renn is Director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin, Germany, and the co-convener of the research seminar \u201cCo-evolutionary Perspectives on the Technosphere,\u201d part of the Anthropocene Curriculum Campus 2016: The Technosphere Issue, at the HKW, Berlin, organized in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, in Berlin.<\/span><\/span> It looks at a specific case evoking Japanese\u2012English translingual encounters on the Pacific Ocean at the very beginning of globalization, from a Japanese point of view: that is, the end of the Edo period in the 1850s. The specific story recalls the first newspaper publisher in Japan, Joseph Heco, aka Hamada Hikoz\u014d, who, having been shipwrecked and rescued by American merchant seamen, misunderstood their English handwritten journal entries as drawings of ocean waves. The artist Toshiaki Hicosaka will discuss his recent artwork based on this anecdote. In response, the curator Eiko Honda will examine questions and possibilities that may unfold from the work in contemporary terms, by contextualizing them within the globalization of knowledge and social systems linked to the emerging notion of the technosphere. Thus, this paper is a result of Hicosaka and Honda\u2019s ongoing dialog in relation to the artist\u2019s latest artwork, created at the NES artist residency in Iceland, as well as Honda\u2019s participation in the Anthropocene Campus 2016: The Technosphere Issue.<\/p>\n ","post_title":"Newspaper Sketches of Ocean

The late Quaternary megafauna extinction was a severe global-scale event. Two factors, climate change and modern humans, have received broad support as the primary drivers, but their absolute and relative importance remains controversial. To date, focus has been on the extinction chronology of individual or small groups of species, specific geographical regions or macroscale studies at very coarse geographical and taxonomic resolution, limiting the possibility of adequately testing the proposed hypotheses. We present, to our knowledge, the first global analysis of this extinction based on comprehensive country-level data on the geographical distribution of all large mammal species (more than, or equal to 10 kg) that have gone globally or continentally extinct between the beginning of the Last Interglacial at 132,000 years BP and the late Holocene 1,000 years BP, testing the relative roles played by glacial\u2013interglacial climate change and humans. We show that the severity of extinction is strongly tied to hominin palaeobiogeography, with at most a weak, Eurasia-specific link to climate change. This first species-level macroscale analysis at relatively high geographical resolution provides strong support for modern humans as the primary driver of the worldwide megafauna losses during the late Quaternary.","name":"anthro_timeline_2016-page-003","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":19646,"date":"2020-02-13 11:36:13","modified":"2020-02-13 11:47:14","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":4500,"height":3000,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ANTHRO_TIMELINE_2016-page-003-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ANTHRO_TIMELINE_2016-page-003-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ANTHRO_TIMELINE_2016-page-003-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ANTHRO_TIMELINE_2016-page-003-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ANTHRO_TIMELINE_2016-page-003.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ANTHRO_TIMELINE_2016-page-003.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ANTHRO_TIMELINE_2016-page-003-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/ANTHRO_TIMELINE_2016-page-003-1600x1067.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}},"teaser_text":"<p>From mega-fauna extinction to atombic bomb: mapping the history of anthropogenic transformations of Earth.<\/p>\n","contributors":[{"ID":3019,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:10","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:10","post_content":"","post_title":"Christopher Reznich","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"christopher-reznich","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:12:23","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:12:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/christopher-reznich\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/christopher-reznich\/","acf":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Reznich"}}],"methods":false,"keywords":[{"term_id":243,"name":"Naturecultures","slug":"naturecultures","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":243,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":46,"filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":198,"name":"Deep time","slug":"deep-time","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":198,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":43,"filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":215,"name":"Extinction","slug":"extinction","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":215,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"folksonomy":false,"location":false}},{"ID":19692,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2016-04-23 13:02:33","post_date_gmt":"2016-04-23 11:02:33","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">A look into the emergence of the technosphere concept and its implications for environmental governance.<\/p>\n A Co-evolutionary Reflection <p>The search for the origin of the Anthropocene and the technosphere is not only a descriptive endeavor: whether we agree on the Neolithic, the Industrial, or the Atomic Revolution as origin points, each has very different consequences on what we perceive as the core problems of the Anthropocene and how to go about solving them.
