Playing creatively with thematics and concepts from history, evolutionary biology, chemistry and resource management, physics, the arts, technology, and complexity theory, the seminar provoked some remarkable conversations, which brought new insight to an understanding of the long-term historical dynamics behind the creation of the Anthropocene, the extent (or absence) of human agency therein, and the power structures behind these developments.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"curatorial-full active\">\n<p>The seminar unfolded in a series of highly stimulating plenary discussions, followed by intermediary sessions in three working groups, and concluding with a brief exercise in creating a timeline for the Anthropocene, which brought into view the different multi-scale and multilayered temporalities embedded in the concept. Highlights from the plenary discussions are available in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/technosphere-co-evolution-a-seminal-seminar-conversation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">edited transcript<\/a>. The working groups revolved around three basic themes: one that explored directly the concept of the technosphere and its level of autonomy; one devoted to applying the concept of co-evolution through storytelling; and a last that was concerned with analyzing and debating the political and economic structures behind the technosphere and the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n<p>Owing to the formidable cross-disciplinary nature of these discussions, the contributions that emerged directly from the seminar aptly reflect a variety of approaches and formats. One contribution consists in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/technostratigraphy-of-a-technological-object\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sheep-shaped measuring tape<\/a>, used as a technological and standardization tool that enables collaboration and communication and scales down the Anthropocene to something more concrete and tangible. Two seminar participants contributed an academic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/the-anthropocene-in-light-of-biological-feedback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paper<\/a> that investigates homeostasis and feedbacks as guiding concepts, in order to compare the Earth in the Anthropocene to a dynamic biological system with its own anthropogenic forms of niche constructions, and to look at the implications between human beings and the planet. The third contribution is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/somewhere-somehow-a-co-evolution-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fictional tale<\/a> exploring the vulnerabilities of the system exposed through a future outbreak of an epidemic in which the distinction between humans and bacteria finally vanishes. Confronted with an undifferentiated anthropocenic nexus in which no boundaries exist, what then remains of the system that is the technosphere, not to speak of an optimized technospheric system?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"center\"><\/div>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"featured","title":"Contributions","display":"grid","items":[{"ID":22580,"post_author":"96","post_date":"2014-11-23 10:58:29","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 09:58:29","post_content":"<p>If dialectical distinctions between humans and bacteria were dissolved into an undifferentiated anthropocenic nexus, what new questions would emerge?

Considering homeostasis as a set of interactions, i.e. biological feedback systems, can help to better understand these mechanisms.<\/p>\n  <p>The robustness of most systems relies on homeostasis, which itself largely depends on redundancy and feedback mechanisms. The Anthropocene, both by definition and in the idea it encapsulates, can be considered as the largest feedback system experienced by human beings: the Anthropocene concept emerged when Earth-related issues started to impact humans in a feedback loop. Here, our main aim is to discuss the concept and implications of feedback, a step that we believe is central to a better understanding of the Anthropocene. To do so, we mainly use biological analogies, because concepts such as robustness, homeostasis, and feedback loops have been studied extensively in that field. Following this viewpoint, Earth\u2019s homeostasis is comparable to that of a dynamic biological system experiencing multiple feedback loops. This naturally leads us to the concept of niche construction, through which our larger habitat becomes part of our own ontology. Last, we discuss frameworks that may help us to understand the interactions between humans and Earth\u2019s homeostasis, and even to question our exact relationship to planet Earth.<\/p>\n ","post_title":"The Anthropocene in Light of Biological Feedback","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"the-anthropocene-in-light-of-biological-feedback","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-03 14:51:27","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-03 12:51:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contribution&#038;p=22614","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contribution","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"pia.lohmann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/the-anthropocene-in-light-of-biological-feedback\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":22649,"id":22649,"title":"The Anthropocene in Light of Biological Feedback","filename":"TC_b5_Feedbacks_image_opt.jpg","filesize":83996,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/TC_b5_Feedbacks_image_opt.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/the-anthropocene-in-light-of-biological-feedback\/tc_b5_feedbacks_image_opt\/","alt":"","author":"96","description":"Graph modified from Wikipedia.org (<a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/3.0\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 3.0<\/a>)","caption":"Figure 1.
