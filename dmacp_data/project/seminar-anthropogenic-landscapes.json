Pertinent for the Anthropocene are large- and small-scale features; an anthropogenic landscape is qualified, at the same time, by its peculiar location, its history, its ecological context, population, and geological substrates, and by the chemical composition of its soil, the altered nitrogen cycle, and the local disappearance of water. Therefore, the investigation of a landscape in the Anthropocene requires a multidimensional and multi-temporal vision, which means the simultaneous activation of dissimilar research perspectives converging to assemble a new way of perceiving. In this seminar, we tried to keep such perspectives both simultaneously activated and open to the possibility of working jointly.<\/p>\n ","post_title":"Seminar Report: Anthropogenic Landscapes","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"seminar-report-anthropogenic-landscapes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-30 15:42:43","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-30 13:42:43","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contribution&#038;p=22778","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contribution","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/seminar-report-anthropogenic-landscapes\/","acf":{"thumbnail":false,"teaser_text":"<p>A reflection on multidimensional and multi-temporal epistemological perspectives required to comprehend and analyze the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n","contributors":false,"methods":[{"term_id":8,"name":"Reflection","slug":"reflection","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":8,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":189,"filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"keywords":[{"term_id":233,"name":"Landscape","slug":"landscape","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":233,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":81,"filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":222,"name":"History","slug":"history","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":222,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":125,"filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":177,"name":"Architecture","slug":"architecture","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":177,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":25,"filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"folksonomy":false,"location":{"address":"Haus der Kulturen der Welt, John-Foster-Dulles-Allee, Berlin, Germany","lat":52.51890849999999,"lng":13.3649115,"zoom":14,"place_id":"ChIJW-9xr7tRqEcRafqpF3pEPEc","name":"Haus der Kulturen der Welt","street_number":"10","street_name":"John-Foster-Dulles-Allee","city":"Berlin","state":"Berlin","post_code":"10557","country":"Germany","country_short":"DE"}}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"featured-children","title":"Subprojects","display":"grid","show_all":true,"ignore":null}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3048,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:11","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:11","post_content":"","post_title":"Elena Bougleux","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"elena-bougleux","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:05:52","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:05:52","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/elena-bougleux\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/elena-bougleux\/","acf":{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"Bougleux"}},{"ID":2977,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:07","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:07","post_content":"","post_title":"Arno Brandlhuber","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"arno-brandlhuber","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-21 18:22:22","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-21 16:22:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/arno-brandlhuber\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/arno-brandlhuber\/","acf":{"first_name":"Arno","last_name":"Brandlhuber"}},{"ID":3061,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:13","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:13","post_content":"","post_title":"Erle C.
