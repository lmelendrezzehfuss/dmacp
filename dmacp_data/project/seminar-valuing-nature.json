In this way a vision of a resource-centered \u201cslow\/soft\u201d Anthropocene is emerging, a practical application for which is appended to the paper. A second exercise executed during the seminar, which focused on Berlin-based actors, sought to understand how society engaged with the transition process. In this context, Herbert Lohner expands on robust mechanisms for effective sustainability strategies in the achievement of sustainable development targets in the city of Berlin.<\/p>\n<p>Environmental responsibility begins with properly quantifying the human impact on ecosystems and then making use of the metrics of nature-valuation to preserve high-quality life-supporting systems in the long term. This is indeed feasible, because quantitative and modeling tools are more available today than they were in the past. Yet, in the past, understanding nature\u2019s value in an economic sense became the common instrument for balancing the human impact. This is illustrated by Sabine H\u00f6hler\u2019s presentation, \u201cTaking Nature into Account\u2014Historical Perspectives and Paradoxes,\u201d which discusses how in the Age of Enlightenment, scientific and economic practices merged to represent the perfect order of nature and state.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, an artistic approach to an alternative \u201ccultural-shift\u201d scenario is presented in Natalie Jeremijenko\u2019s project \u201cTree X Office.\u201d If the human capacity to own property bestows political agency, independence, and even personhood upon the owner, what would happen if a tree is given this same capacity?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"featured-children","title":"Subprojects","display":"grid","show_all":true,"ignore":null},{"acf_fc_layout":"featured","title":"Contributions","display":"grid","items":[{"ID":22711,"post_author":"97","post_date":"2014-11-23 17:28:28","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-23 16:28:28","post_content":"<p class=\"text\">2027 is the year of the first manned space-travel mission to Mars.
