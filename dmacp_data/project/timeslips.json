our first reconnaissance trip in the summer of 2018, we recorded audio and video from the Grand Tower levee road, particularly along the stretch that traverses Grand Tower Island, which is itself noteworthy as an oxbow curve circumscribed by Tower Island Chute. One of the peculiarities of this site is that the island is defined as a portion of the state of Missouri that happens to lie to the east of the Mississippi. Although this is not unique\u2014there are other small crescent-shaped slices of land that disobey the general rule of west-of-the-Mississippi=Missouri and east-of-the-Mississippi=Illinois\u2014it suggests that the mutability of the river\u2019s course has been a factor in legally defining territorial boundaries in the past, and that the literal terraforming program of building levees to fix the river\u2019s course along its length is obviously a contradiction of the true nature of the Mississippi.<\/p>\n<p>This has been dramatized by the way the river has (over the course of several months of high water levels) seeped through the levees to such an extent that even if the water did not overtop the barriers, farmland on the supposedly dry side of levees and roads has been slowly inundated and rendered impossible to cultivate.<\/p>\n<p>We had specifically intended to return to this levee road in summer 2019 to record additional video footage and field audio, but the reality of the situation created by the significant flooding throughout the upper Midwest since January 2019 has resulted in damage to many locations that were accessible to us last year. Consequently, the relevant authorities in Jackson County have denied access to the same roads that we drove on previously. In response, we were compelled to select alternate sites for production recordings. Witnessing the distressed situation prompted us to reflect on the seriousness of the results wrought by such methods of geoengineering; as one local resident later told us, this was the worst flooding he had experienced in his 83 years.<\/p>\n"}]},"contributors":[{"ID":3215,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:27","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:27","post_content":"","post_title":"Marlena Novak","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"marlena-novak","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-10-26 11:06:50","post_modified_gmt":"2020-10-26 10:06:50","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/marlena-novak\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/marlena-novak\/","acf":{"first_name":"Marlena","last_name":"Novak"}},{"ID":3123,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:18","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:18","post_content":"","post_title":"Jay Alan Yim","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"jay-alan-yim","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-25 15:27:37","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-25 13:27:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributor\/jay-alan-yim\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"alan","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/jay-alan-yim\/","acf":{"first_name":"Jay Alan","last_name":"Yim"}},{"ID":4424,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2019-08-26 10:37:26","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-26 08:37:26","post_content":"","post_title":"Joslyn Willauer","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"joslyn-willauer","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-09-10 13:36:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-09-10 11:36:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contributor&#038;p=4424","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contributor","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"anujah.fernando","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contributors\/joslyn-willauer\/","acf":{"first_name":"Joslyn ","last_name":"Willauer"}}],"methods":[{"term_id":4,"name":"Field Study","slug":"field-study","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":4,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":111,"filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"keywords":[{"term_id":219,"name":"Geo-engineering","slug":"geo-engineering","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":219,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":11,"filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":229,"name":"Infrastructure","slug":"infrastructure","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":229,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":82,"filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":216,"name":"Flood","slug":"flood","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":216,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":18,"filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"folksonomy":false,"location":{"address":"","lat":"38.626526838378","lng":"-90.199127197266","zoom":"10","markers":"[]","layers":"[\"Stamen.TonerLite\"]","version":"1.1.0"},"subtitle":"","teaser_text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the difference between a river and a boundary.
