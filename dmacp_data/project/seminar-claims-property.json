From the historic and ongoing systematic dislocation of New Orleans\u2019 Black population to the efforts of the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe, who have lived for generations in kinship with a now threatened landscape, to secure Federal Recognition, the seminar made clear the differences between living with place and making property.
