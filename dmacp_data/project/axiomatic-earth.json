The eye of the algorithm blindly records emerging properties and forecasts tendencies based on large data sets. Such procedures of computation are pretty repetitive and robotic and they generally operate along two main functions: pattern recognition and anomaly detection. The two epistemic poles of pattern and anomaly are two sides of the same coin of algorithmic governance. An unexpected anomaly can be detected only against the background of pattern regularity. And, conversely, a pattern emerges only through the median equalization of different tendencies.

In particular, geology and biology have provided the main tools through which the Earth is axiomatized, allowing it to enter multiple regimes of economic and financial calculation. Even if the classification of nature according to scientific frameworks is not necessarily related to the practice of resource extraction, it carries within itself a propensity for instrumentalization (numbering, classifying). In any case, the problem is not science per se, but the fact that its \u201celiminativist\u201d mobilization\u2014to paraphrase Stengers\u2014has come to constitute \u201ccommon sense\u201d for how nature is to be understood. Thus, today, we are facing the important question: Is it possible to decolonize techno-scientific practices? The well-known case of Yasun\u00ed-ITT in Ecuador provides, in my view, a unique perspective from which we can start to discuss these problems.<\/p>\n ","post_title":"Anomalous

Addressed were the history of the database, the registering abilities of oil slicks as well as the political consequences of heavy-oil classifications in Venezuela, the constitution of the mental as a militarized and financialized object, and the political instrumentality of the Copenhagen Climate Agreement&#8217;s fixation on the 2 degree average temperature increase. A sixth session extended the idea of abstraction to the group itself, by classifying the discussions to reveal subjectivities and power frameworks within the group.
