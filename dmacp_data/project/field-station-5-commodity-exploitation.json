Dialogue Between Anthropologist Jim Barnett and Anthropocene Scholar and Curator Maya K\u00f3vskaya<\/p>\n","start":"10\/23\/2019","end":"10\/23\/2019","description":"<p><em>Etiologies of Anthropocenic Emergence between the Natchez Trace, the Grand Village, and the Mississippi River in Natchez:\u00a0A Dialogue Between Anthropologist Jim Barnett and Anthropocene Scholar and Curator Maya K\u00f3vskaya<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Natchez Indian and Mississippi Indian specialist and anthropologist, Jim Barnett, will be in dialogue with Natchez Field Station curator and Anthropocene scholar, Maya K\u00f3vskaya, about empirical and historical questions pertaining to the research of the Natchez Field Station, focused on the emergence of the Anthropocene in this region, which is a microcosm of what happened in the Americas more generally.<\/p>\n<p>The dialogue will begin with an acknowledgment of the 10,000-year-old Holocene origins of the Natchez Trace, the Mississippi River, and the myriad forms of natural agency in these multispecies terrestrial and riverine landscapes of the pre-colonial era in the region. Barnett will also briefly introduce elements of pre-colonial indigenous ways of life and relationships to the natural world in the area.<\/p>\n<p>We will then discuss etiologies of an emergent Anthropocene, as white European settler-colonialist began to systematically colonize the Americas in the 15<sup>th<\/sup> century. Colonization set in motion the processes characterized as the Anthropocene in many ways, radically transforming the continent, altering its landscapes, its ecosystems, and setting in motion arguably the largest scale genocide in human history\u2014millions upon millions of indigenous peoples across the continent, with up to 90% of the indigenous population dying within the first centuries of colonization\u2014destroying their civilizations, cultures, relationships with the natural world, and ways of life, spreading catastrophic diseases, as well as setting off the Little Ice Age with the Orbis Spike, and initiating massive changes in the global biosphere through the Columbian Exchange.<\/p>\n<p>These widespread colonial processes and outcomes are mirrored in the Natchez context, so Natchez offers a micro-case for a deep dive into the complex causally entangled processes leading out of the Holocene with what is most likely a geological boundary event being problematically dubbed the Anthropocene, or \u201cAge of Man.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Natchez case\u2014which in many ways mirrors the experiences of the colonized world in the Americas, Africa, India, Oceania, and parts of Asia, over the subsequent 500 hundred plus years\u2014reaffirms the many critiques of the over-generalized assumptions implicit in the evocation of\u00a0 \u201c<em>anthropos<\/em>\u201d in Anthropocene, which identifies an artificially universalized, flattened <em>human<\/em> as the global, primary causal force disrupting the life-support systems of the planet, and leaving a geological scar that will last into deep geological time beyond our species\u2019 own extinction.<\/p>\n<p>While it is, indeed, <em>humans<\/em> and <em>not other species <\/em>that have set in motion these processes, like other colonial cases, K\u00f3vskaya argues that\u00a0the Natchez case, demonstrates conclusively that the clearly identifiable causal <em>perpetrators<\/em> of the violence that is the Anthropocene here are a <em>very specific subset of humans,<\/em> with a very specific model of civilization, informed and rationalized by very specific sets of beliefs. These are the Human Exceptionalist (Human Supremacist) ideologies assuming \u201cman\u2019s dominion over nature,\u201d and White Supremacist ideologies claiming a \u201cwhite man\u2019s burden\u201d and a \u201cmanifest destiny,\u201d which putatively entitles white European colonizers to treat radically Othered beings and more-than-human natural entities and agents as mere &#8220;<em>Things&#8221;<\/em>\u2014instruments and\/or material\u2014over which these white men have dominion; &#8220;<em>Things&#8221;<\/em> that are there for the taking; &#8220;<em>Things&#8221;<\/em> that exist for the sole purpose of extraction and exploitation. With the same radical ontological negation of non-extractive, non-instrumental or intrinsic value, these ideologies rationalize both <em>ecocidal<\/em> destruction of ecosystems and planetary life support systems, and also the <em>genocidal<\/em> denial of the humanity of non-white peoples, making possible and palatable (for perpetrators) institutions of industrial-scale chattel slavery, and slave-powered industrial scale monocrop plantations, and practices of casual and intentional indigenous genocide.<\/p>\n<p>This colonizing \u201cwhiteness,\u201d K\u00f3vskaya argues, is constituted as a \u201cresidual category\u201d based on a foundational invidious negation of these designated Others, and White Supremacism entails an assumption of concomitant entitlement to <em>use<\/em> the Othered even to death, depletion, and extinction. This radical Othering at the core of the social construction and cultural constitution of \u201cwhiteness\u201d causally connects genocide with ecocide, and forms the ideational and cultural underpinnings for the specific human activities that set in motion exclusion, exploitation, eradication, extinction, and extraction at an industrial scale, driving the massive planetary-systems disruptions attendant to the \u201cAnthropocene.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jim Barnett will share his rich knowledge of\u00a0the history of the Theloel nation, later known as the Natchez Indians, in the context of how the colonial encounter destroyed their civilization, their political structures, and their intra-tribal relationships, ultimately leading to their enslavement and eradication as a nation and a people.<\/p>\n<p>As we discuss how the first colonial encounters with the Spanish, French, and English unfolded, in the context of the Anthropocene discourse and the claims made in Maya K\u00f3vskaya\u2019s research, Jim Barnett will share his rich, well-researched knowledge about the local context and history of Natchez, its unruly natural systems, millennium plus of stable indigenous civilization, and subsequent, rapid, colonial decimation.<\/p>\n<p>The changing nature of the colonial slave trade will also be a major focus of the conversation. We will look at how the colonizers destroyed the local economy, and how they used the slave trade to destroy intra-nation and intra-tribal relations and internal political structures, and how the introduction of enslaved people trafficked from Africa changed Natchez dramatically, once again. We will also look at relations between indigenous peoples and enslaved or escaped, trafficked Africans\u2014some of whom expressed solidarity and even joined the failed resistance to colonial genocide.<\/p>\n<p>We will continue by examining what happened following the demise of the Theloel (or Thecloel) nation\u2014or Natchez Indians\u2014with Barnett sharing his later research on the nascent United States\u2019 relations with remaining Indigenous people in Mississippi region up through Andrew Jackson&#8217;s brutal policy of Indian Removal and the Trail of Tears.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we will return to a discussion of the agency of nature manifested in the Mississippi river itself,\u00a0the role it has played shaping the histories of the region, flooding, climate change, and Barnett\u2019s latest book on ill-fated human attempts to control it.<\/p>\n","contributors":[{"ID":3227,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:27","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21

ecology.<\/p>\n Reckoning in Search of Regeneration <p>It is time to contend with kudzu, the multifaceted plant that is both a monolithic myth\u2014the \u201cvine that ate the South\u201d\u2014and a rooted, living plurality comprised of at least five species and subspecies of semi-woody climbing vines in the <em>Pueraria<\/em> genus. Transplanted from East Asia in an age of imperial expansion and bioprospecting, <em>Pueraria<\/em> species have become firmly rooted in the natural-cultural landscape of the Southeastern United States over the past 150 years. Meanwhile the myth of kudzu has seeped into the collective consciousness of Americans well beyond the plant\u2019s biological range, becoming a rallying symbol for the \u201cwar on invasive species,\u201d which has claimed the attention and energy of conservation biologists, agrochemical engineers, and weekend \u201cweed warriors\u201d across the United States in recent decades.<\/p>\n <p>In all its forms, kudzu is an archetypal companion plant fitting for an age of mass extinction and climate chaos. Traveling to Natchez to meet kudzu on the contested American terrain it has colonized alongside many other migrants, I too will ground myself there to face our shared complicity in the ecocidal system that has brought us together. The distance between the secondhand stories, tales, and slurs that nourish kudzu, which colonizes our collective consciousness, and the leafy biological reality of the millions of plants that breathe, fix nitrogen, and stretch towards the sun is enormous. In the gap between the abstraction and the earthly reality there is ample space to interrogate the tenacious set of ills that plague the Western, settler-colonial environmental imaginary under late capitalism.<\/p>\n<p><em>Introduction to Multisensorial Encounters with Kudzu<\/em><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/367179473\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>It is here in this gap that <em>Re-patterning with Kudzu<\/em> takes root. Through bodily engagement with this infamous being, <em>Re-patterning with Kudzu<\/em> is an entry point into the intertwining histories of indigenous and precolonial ecologies, global trade and bioprospecting, plantation monocultures, and agrochemical excesses. Video, paint-making, and ecology fieldwork will guide the creation of a multisensorial guide to tangling with this vegetal other, reckoning with nativeness and belonging, the racialized rhetoric of invasion biology, and the imperative for settler-colonial environmentalisms brought to confront the looming specter of white nationalist ecofascism. What does an anti-racist, nonviolent restoration ecology look like in the face of mass migration? How can we actively counter the \u201cMake America Green Again\u201d scenarios that rely on a fallacy of pristine wilderness premised on indigenous erasure?\u00a0 Who benefits and who suffers under schemes to \u201ceradicate\u201d nonhuman lifeforms labeled as invasive? What impact does this rhetoric have on white, settler-colonial attitudes towards the rights of human migrants?<\/p>\n<p>Although kudzu, a misunderstood edge-dweller in an Anthropocene drama, cannot answer these questions, it is a compelling companion with which to contemplate them. Perhaps in doing so, we can re-pattern ourselves to seek the narratives of abundance, regeneration, and flux that are so necessary if we are to replace the tired and dangerous habit of telling tales premised on scarcity, rigidity, and fear.<\/p>\n<p><em><br \/>\nGrounding Exercise for Exploring Vegetal Agency and Soil Awareness<\/em><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/w.soundcloud.com\/player\/?url=https%3A\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/699857815&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","post_title":"Re-Patterning with Kudzu","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"re-patterning-with-kudzu","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2021-02-15 12:10:24","post_modified_gmt":"2021-02-15 11:10:24","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2771,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=8790","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"anujah.fernando","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-5-commodity-exploitation\/natchez-etiologies-of-athropogenic-emergence\/re-patterning-with-kudzu\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":8791,"id":8791,"title":"Irons","filename":"Irons.jpg","filesize":469397,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Irons.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-5-commodity-exploitation\/natchez-etiologies-of-athropogenic-emergence\/re-patterning-with-kudzu\/irons\/","alt":"","author":"9","description":"","caption":"Ellie Irons in collaboration with Angela Dittmar and Pueraria montana, Chattanooga, Tennessee, September 1, 2019.
