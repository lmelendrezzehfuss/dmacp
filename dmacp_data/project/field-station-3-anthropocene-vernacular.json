As a coherent geographic interval stretching from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers down to the confluence with the Kaskaskia River, this flood plain\u2014known to geographers and anthropologists as The American Bottom\u2014is site to the social and spatial aspirations of pre-contact Native Americans, 19th century industrial expansion, 20th century infrastructural consolidation, and 21st century ecological precarity.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this region is currently defined less by its inherent ecological and geological continuities and more by the industrial patterns that have effectively fractured this region into closed parcels of extraction, production, and displacement. It is a territory where the Cahokia Mounds UNESCO heritage site abuts a Superfund site, where French Colonial settlement patterns shape 20th century urban forms, where the first incorporated African-American town in the U.S. abuts the site of this country\u2019s most notorious race riot, and where a powerful Mississippi river flows disconnected from its still-vital flood plane. Through this rather compact region, then, an entire history of North American settlement and aspirations can be told.<\/p>\n<p>The American Bottom Gazette\u00a0tells the story of this region through an attention to the landscape, communities, and histories of its residents. As much description of a once well-defined geography as it is a recovery of that geography, our goal with\u00a0the Gazette is to provide a framework for deciphering the irreducible landscape we find today. This publication is available to readers in public libraries, diners, and all kinds of community spaces in between &#8212; while also having visibility in the larger St. Louis metro area and beyond.\u00a0It is our hope that people familiar and unfamiliar with this region alike will find something instructive in this publication. As a <strong>specific<\/strong> geography, the American Bottom has seen a history of human settlement, ecological transformation, and social convergence that we find truly singular in the American context. At the same time, as a <strong>typical<\/strong> geography, the American Bottom picks up on patterns that might be recognizable at the divided urban periphery of every large American city at the beginning of the 21st century. And it is to both these registers\u2014the specific and the general\u2014that we hope this project speaks.<\/p>\n","contributors":false,"methods":[{"term_id":3,"name":"Storytelling","slug":"storytelling","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":143,"filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"Keywords":[{"term_id":208,"name":"Engagement","slug":"engagement","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":208,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":27,"filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":235,"name":"Local knowledge","slug":"local-knowledge","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":235,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":56,"filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"location":"The Luminary, 2701 Cherokee Street, St. Louis, MO 63118","map":{"address":"The Luminary, 2701 Cherokee Street, St. Louis, MO 63118, USA","lat":"38.5938114","lng":"-90.2278723"}}},{"ID":8109,"post_author":"37","post_date":"2019-09-06 14:30:18","post_date_gmt":"2019-09-06 12:30:18","post_content":"","post_title":"Field Station 3 | Territories, Watersheds, Infrastructures","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"field-station-3-territories-watersheds-infrastructures","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-10-03 18:40:59","post_modified_gmt":"2019-10-03 16:40:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=event&#038;p=8109","menu_order":0,"post_type":"event","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"melissa.canbaz","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/events\/field-station-3-territories-watersheds-infrastructures\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":12419,"id":12419,"title":"CCC_bw_sm (1)","filename":"CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932.jpg","filesize":578235,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/events\/field-station-3-territories-watersheds-infrastructures\/ccc_bw_sm-1-2\/","alt":"","author":"12","description":"by Derek Hoeferlin","caption":"Continental Cement Company, St. Louis","name":"ccc_bw_sm-1-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":8109,"date":"2019-09-24 14:46:34","modified":"2019-09-24 14:50:05","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":3000,"height":1140,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932-768x292.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":292,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932-300x114.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":114,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932-768x292.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":292,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932-1400x532.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":532,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":584,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":778,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/CCC_bw_sm-1-e1569336568932-1600x608.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":608}},"teaser_text":"<p>Barge Opening<\/p>\n","start":"10\/04\/2019","end":"10\/04\/2019","description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/infrastructures\/\">Territories\u2014Watersheds\u2014Infrastructures<\/a> is a multi-scalar field documentation and mapping project that positions the Mississippi, its tributaries, and the St. Louis region within its broader watershed\u2014particularly highlighting the complicated intersections of river management, industry and recreation.

This research project takes a closer look at the interconnected relationship between horses and humans.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n  <p>The arrival of horses on the North American continent has exerted a tremendous influence on land use patterns, societal developments, and cultural practices. But how did early indigenous societies domesticate horses and how has this process, in turn, shaped and changed the landscape and culture of the Mississippi?<\/p>\n <p>The arrival of European horses in the Americas prompted drastic changes to the cultural and ecological landscape of the continent\u2019s interior. Horses changed the way that the peoples of the Mississippi region used the land, allowed them to develop new forms of subsistence, and prompted major socio-cultural changes that reshaped the history of the Americas. Although historical documents partially chronicled this process, the record is incomplete\u2014it offers only tantalizing clues as to when animals were first adopted by people in the region or how they developed techniques for managing, breeding, and controlling horses, donkeys, and mules.<\/p>\n<p>Animal bones from archaeological sites have proven to be a valuable resource for understanding human\u2013horse interactions in the past. Through techniques such as 3D scanning and osteology, researchers can gain a detailed picture of horse health, health care, management, and use by humans (such as bridling and transport), even in the absence of historical records. Unfortunately, these remains are scarce in early historic archaeological sites in central areas of North America. But since 2017, researchers have begun using laser-based mass spectrometry and ancient DNA to help identify horse bones from these contexts, using biomolecular methods to understand factors such as sex, diet, and other information, which it is possible to attain even from tiny or badly fragmented bits of bone. Pairing this approach with radiocarbon dating and Bayesian statistical modeling, incorporating historic and ethnohistoric records, we plan to model the geographic spread of domestic equids into the region. Combining these data with paleoecological and environmental data sets, the role played by these domesticated animals in transforming landscapes and ecologies will be explored.<\/p>\n<p>This research study will involve traveling to archaeofaunal collections in the Mississippi River Valley region and beyond. By conducting both an osteological study as well as a biomolecular study of horse remains, the project will investigate the history of equine management and care in early indigenous societies and map how the introduction and spread of domesticated horses altered the natural and cultural landscape of the ancient Mississippi region.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Horses, Donkeys, and the Anthropocene in the Greater Mississippi","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"horses-donkeys-and-the-anthropocene-in-the-greater-mississippi","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-10-22 14:11:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-10-22 12:11:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=5365","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"thithutrang.tran","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/horses-donkeys-and-the-anthropocene-in-the-greater-mississippi\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":4025,"id":4025,"title":"Taylor_Horses","filename":"Taylor_Horses.jpg","filesize":108785,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?attachment_id=4025","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Courtesy of the American Philosophical Society, APS image 2689.","caption":"Sketch of Oto hunters made by Titian Peale, Major Stephen Long Expedition member, who accompanied the Oto on hunts between 1819 and 1820.","name":"taylor_horses","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":4149,"date":"2019-08-25 12:27:48","modified":"2019-09-03 16:43:03","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1200,"height":769,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-768x492.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":492,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-300x192.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":192,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-768x492.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":492,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-1024x656.jpg","large-width":1024,"large-height":656,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses.jpg","1536x1536-width":1200,"1536x1536-height":769,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses.jpg","2048x2048-width":1200,"2048x2048-height":769,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses.jpg","feature-width":1200,"feature-height":769}},"teaser_text":"<div class=\"col-ms-6 masonry-grid col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"BOXkfBu3G1at62QKeaSvr hkwcontribution teaser-box teaser-debate undefined\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col-ms-6 masonry-grid col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"BOXkfBu3G1at62QKeaSvr hkwcontribution teaser-box teaser-symposium: presentation undefined\">\n<p class=\"title\">What was the impact of the domestication of horses on the natural and cultural landscapes of the Mississippi?

This research project turns to the cultivation of maize to tackle this question.<\/p>\n  <p>The farming of maize, or corn as it is more commonly referred to, plays a fundamental role in today&#8217;s industrial agriculture of the Midwest but the cultivation of this crop dates far back in time. How did maize spread across the North American continent and what influence did it exert on regional ecologies?<\/p>\n <p>The Anthropocene is conventionally associated with two important stages of human intervention, the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and the Great Acceleration in energy and resource use that began in the mid-twentieth century. Yet there is persuasive evidence that this distinctly human epoch has a far older history. Long before the twentieth century, agriculture and domestication fundamentally altered the ecological composition and function of vast tracts of land, and this is a story that can only be told with the tools of archaeology.<\/p>\n<p>Today, maize has become a staple crop, the basis of a sixty-billion-dollar annual industry that imposed a distinct ecology on the former prairie landscape of the Midwest and conditioned the diets of North America and, following the Columbian exchange, the world. This crop\u2019s transformative rise began more than 5,500 years ago, at which time the evidence suggests that a strain of wild grass from Mexico, teosinte, underwent morphological changes because of human cultivation, indicating domestication. The crops eventually went on to dominate farming systems across the Americas before the first Europeans arrived. The rapid dispersal of this semitropical crop into the temperate regions of North America is still not fully understood and has long been a contentious topic. Archaeobotanical remains attest to its presence in the North American Southwest two millennia ago. Yet scholars do not agree upon when it spread across the rest of North America and, more importantly, when cultivation of it intensified to eventually replace the traditional small-seeded crops of North America\u2014causing the disappearance of the ancient \u201cLost Crops.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This project attempts to demonstrate how maize transformed North America\u2019s ecology in a distinct way by linking the extant archaeobotanical record with a new, purpose-built database. Using collagen gathered from fragments of bones and tooth enamel, mapping the timing and location of maize consumption will be possible by tracing specific isotopic forms of carbon that result from its consumption. Collating and analyzing this evidence of human development, hand in hand with extant data on environmental change, this project expects to produce a detailed visualization, revealing the rate, dispersal, and paths taken by this important biostratigraphic indicator.<\/p>\n","post_title":"The Early Rise of North America's Dominant Crop","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"5384-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-01-28 13:36:35","post_modified_gmt":"2020-01-28 12:36:35","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=5384","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"thithutrang.tran","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/5384-2\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":4201,"id":4201,"title":"Corncobs","filename":"Corncobs.jpg","filesize":427360,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/5384-2\/corncobs\/","alt":"","author":"9","description":"by Sam Fentress, <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/2.0\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 2.0<\/a>","caption":"Variegated maize ears","name":"corncobs","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":5384,"date":"2019-08-25 14:48:17","modified":"2020-05-11 21:24:19","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1000,"height":667,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","large-width":1000,"large-height":667,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","1536x1536-width":1000,"1536x1536-height":667,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","2048x2048-width":1000,"2048x2048-height":667,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","feature-width":1000,"feature-height":667}},"teaser_text":"<p class=\"text\">How have early agricultural practices shaped and altered the environment of the Mississippi?

A research project on the influence of animals on human farming practices.<\/p>\n  <p>Vast soy and corn fields dominate the landscape of industrial agriculture in the North American Midwest. Decades ago however, this stretch of land was marked by rich argricultural diversity. But what does the spread of these early domesticated plant species imply about human-animal relations? And how did they influence the emergence of agricultural practices?<\/p>\n <p>The modern agricultural system of the North American Midwest is of unparalleled genetic homogeneity. Its dominant crops are cloned hybrids from a handful of parent lineages. The majority of traits in these maize and soy crops date back only a few decades and are testament to a great acceleration in the use of nitrogen fertilizer and advances in irrigation and mechanized harvesting. Which is to say, the highly curated fields of the American Midwest are the quintessential expression of the Anthropocene, a choreographed display of human environmental engineering which has narrowed down the entire vegetation community to just a few cloned variants within two crop subspecies, bred and\u2014more recently\u2014engineered to maximize productivity under highly regulated growing conditions. Heavy herbicide, pesticide, and fungicide use homogenizes the ecosystem of this landscape further to express an extreme form of human niche construction. It comes at great environmental cost, not least of which is the effect of nitrogen washing downriver to create eutrophic dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>However, for over 250 generations, a diverse array of locally adapted crops\u2014almost entirely unknown today\u2014grew in this same region. Sumpweed, maygrass, little barley, sunflower, goosefoot, and erect knotweed are just some of a cast of ancient \u201cLost Crops\u201d now only present in the archaeobotanical record. Little is known about this early agriculture, but in order to gain greater insight, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History have joined forces with the Lost Crops Garden Network, a network of American scholars concerned with crop reconstruction. This project proposes that the wild ancestors of these, now lost, crops shared a distinct set of traits, which suggest that their seeds were dispersed via consumption by animals (endozoochoric). Their thesis ist that the megafaunal herds of the Pleistocene and bison of the Holocene were the primary dispersal mechanism for these early-domesticated species, and this project plans to test this hypothesis in the Mississippi region, an ideal natural laboratory given the vast herds of bison that continued to thrive there until the 1850s.<\/p>\n<p>Having consumed the wild plants laden with seeds in their thousands, bison would defecate the seeds into a nitrogen-rich bed of fertilizer, thereby playing an essential role in their germination and dispersal. Their diet and ethology would possibly lead to dense patches of annual plants within the tallgrass prairies, similar to cultivated fields. Human beings may have been capable of harvesting and maintaining such convenient sources of nutrition, a practice that could have led to the domestication of these species and informed subsequent farming practices. If confirmed, this would explain why early agriculture focused on these specific plants. At the same time, it is possible to explain how the current rarity of this species is due to hunting, which disrupted their dispersal mechanism and reduced their number to near extinction in the nineteenth century.<\/p>\n<p>The project hopes to test this novel thesis of the emergence of agriculture and subsequent turn toward industrial agriculture. To do so, the project will carry out three sets of studies in the summer of 2019. The first set involves botanical surveys in tallgrass prairies where herds of bison have been reintroduced. Plant communities will be analyzed and compared to bison-free prairies, to gauge whether bison are a concentration factor. Where possible, dung will be collected and the seeds it contains will be quantified; seed morphology will be documented also. Two more studies will involve controlled experiments with captive bison. One will determine the relationship between their digestive tract and seed germination rates.

This research project takes a closer look at the interconnected relationship between horses and humans.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n  <p>The arrival of horses on the North American continent has exerted a tremendous influence on land use patterns, societal developments, and cultural practices. But how did early indigenous societies domesticate horses and how has this process, in turn, shaped and changed the landscape and culture of the Mississippi?<\/p>\n <p>The arrival of European horses in the Americas prompted drastic changes to the cultural and ecological landscape of the continent\u2019s interior. Horses changed the way that the peoples of the Mississippi region used the land, allowed them to develop new forms of subsistence, and prompted major socio-cultural changes that reshaped the history of the Americas. Although historical documents partially chronicled this process, the record is incomplete\u2014it offers only tantalizing clues as to when animals were first adopted by people in the region or how they developed techniques for managing, breeding, and controlling horses, donkeys, and mules.<\/p>\n<p>Animal bones from archaeological sites have proven to be a valuable resource for understanding human\u2013horse interactions in the past. Through techniques such as 3D scanning and osteology, researchers can gain a detailed picture of horse health, health care, management, and use by humans (such as bridling and transport), even in the absence of historical records. Unfortunately, these remains are scarce in early historic archaeological sites in central areas of North America. But since 2017, researchers have begun using laser-based mass spectrometry and ancient DNA to help identify horse bones from these contexts, using biomolecular methods to understand factors such as sex, diet, and other information, which it is possible to attain even from tiny or badly fragmented bits of bone. Pairing this approach with radiocarbon dating and Bayesian statistical modeling, incorporating historic and ethnohistoric records, we plan to model the geographic spread of domestic equids into the region. Combining these data with paleoecological and environmental data sets, the role played by these domesticated animals in transforming landscapes and ecologies will be explored.<\/p>\n<p>This research study will involve traveling to archaeofaunal collections in the Mississippi River Valley region and beyond. By conducting both an osteological study as well as a biomolecular study of horse remains, the project will investigate the history of equine management and care in early indigenous societies and map how the introduction and spread of domesticated horses altered the natural and cultural landscape of the ancient Mississippi region.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Horses, Donkeys, and the Anthropocene in the Greater Mississippi","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"horses-donkeys-and-the-anthropocene-in-the-greater-mississippi","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-10-22 14:11:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-10-22 12:11:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=5365","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"thithutrang.tran","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/horses-donkeys-and-the-anthropocene-in-the-greater-mississippi\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":4025,"id":4025,"title":"Taylor_Horses","filename":"Taylor_Horses.jpg","filesize":108785,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?attachment_id=4025","alt":"","author":"10","description":"Courtesy of the American Philosophical Society, APS image 2689.","caption":"Sketch of Oto hunters made by Titian Peale, Major Stephen Long Expedition member, who accompanied the Oto on hunts between 1819 and 1820.","name":"taylor_horses","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":4149,"date":"2019-08-25 12:27:48","modified":"2019-09-03 16:43:03","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1200,"height":769,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-768x492.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":492,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-300x192.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":192,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-768x492.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":492,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-1024x656.jpg","large-width":1024,"large-height":656,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses.jpg","1536x1536-width":1200,"1536x1536-height":769,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses.jpg","2048x2048-width":1200,"2048x2048-height":769,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Taylor_Horses.jpg","feature-width":1200,"feature-height":769}},"teaser_text":"<div class=\"col-ms-6 masonry-grid col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"BOXkfBu3G1at62QKeaSvr hkwcontribution teaser-box teaser-debate undefined\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col-ms-6 masonry-grid col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"BOXkfBu3G1at62QKeaSvr hkwcontribution teaser-box teaser-symposium: presentation undefined\">\n<p class=\"title\">What was the impact of the domestication of horses on the natural and cultural landscapes of the Mississippi?

This research project turns to the cultivation of maize to tackle this question.<\/p>\n  <p>The farming of maize, or corn as it is more commonly referred to, plays a fundamental role in today&#8217;s industrial agriculture of the Midwest but the cultivation of this crop dates far back in time. How did maize spread across the North American continent and what influence did it exert on regional ecologies?<\/p>\n <p>The Anthropocene is conventionally associated with two important stages of human intervention, the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and the Great Acceleration in energy and resource use that began in the mid-twentieth century. Yet there is persuasive evidence that this distinctly human epoch has a far older history. Long before the twentieth century, agriculture and domestication fundamentally altered the ecological composition and function of vast tracts of land, and this is a story that can only be told with the tools of archaeology.<\/p>\n<p>Today, maize has become a staple crop, the basis of a sixty-billion-dollar annual industry that imposed a distinct ecology on the former prairie landscape of the Midwest and conditioned the diets of North America and, following the Columbian exchange, the world. This crop\u2019s transformative rise began more than 5,500 years ago, at which time the evidence suggests that a strain of wild grass from Mexico, teosinte, underwent morphological changes because of human cultivation, indicating domestication. The crops eventually went on to dominate farming systems across the Americas before the first Europeans arrived. The rapid dispersal of this semitropical crop into the temperate regions of North America is still not fully understood and has long been a contentious topic. Archaeobotanical remains attest to its presence in the North American Southwest two millennia ago. Yet scholars do not agree upon when it spread across the rest of North America and, more importantly, when cultivation of it intensified to eventually replace the traditional small-seeded crops of North America\u2014causing the disappearance of the ancient \u201cLost Crops.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This project attempts to demonstrate how maize transformed North America\u2019s ecology in a distinct way by linking the extant archaeobotanical record with a new, purpose-built database. Using collagen gathered from fragments of bones and tooth enamel, mapping the timing and location of maize consumption will be possible by tracing specific isotopic forms of carbon that result from its consumption. Collating and analyzing this evidence of human development, hand in hand with extant data on environmental change, this project expects to produce a detailed visualization, revealing the rate, dispersal, and paths taken by this important biostratigraphic indicator.<\/p>\n","post_title":"The Early Rise of North America's Dominant Crop","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"5384-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-01-28 13:36:35","post_modified_gmt":"2020-01-28 12:36:35","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=5384","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"thithutrang.tran","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/5384-2\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":4201,"id":4201,"title":"Corncobs","filename":"Corncobs.jpg","filesize":427360,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/5384-2\/corncobs\/","alt":"","author":"9","description":"by Sam Fentress, <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/2.0\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 2.0<\/a>","caption":"Variegated maize ears","name":"corncobs","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":5384,"date":"2019-08-25 14:48:17","modified":"2020-05-11 21:24:19","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1000,"height":667,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","large-width":1000,"large-height":667,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","1536x1536-width":1000,"1536x1536-height":667,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","2048x2048-width":1000,"2048x2048-height":667,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Corncobs.jpg","feature-width":1000,"feature-height":667}},"teaser_text":"<p class=\"text\">How have early agricultural practices shaped and altered the environment of the Mississippi?

A research project on the influence of animals on human farming practices.<\/p>\n  <p>Vast soy and corn fields dominate the landscape of industrial agriculture in the North American Midwest. Decades ago however, this stretch of land was marked by rich argricultural diversity. But what does the spread of these early domesticated plant species imply about human-animal relations? And how did they influence the emergence of agricultural practices?<\/p>\n <p>The modern agricultural system of the North American Midwest is of unparalleled genetic homogeneity. Its dominant crops are cloned hybrids from a handful of parent lineages. The majority of traits in these maize and soy crops date back only a few decades and are testament to a great acceleration in the use of nitrogen fertilizer and advances in irrigation and mechanized harvesting. Which is to say, the highly curated fields of the American Midwest are the quintessential expression of the Anthropocene, a choreographed display of human environmental engineering which has narrowed down the entire vegetation community to just a few cloned variants within two crop subspecies, bred and\u2014more recently\u2014engineered to maximize productivity under highly regulated growing conditions. Heavy herbicide, pesticide, and fungicide use homogenizes the ecosystem of this landscape further to express an extreme form of human niche construction. It comes at great environmental cost, not least of which is the effect of nitrogen washing downriver to create eutrophic dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>However, for over 250 generations, a diverse array of locally adapted crops\u2014almost entirely unknown today\u2014grew in this same region. Sumpweed, maygrass, little barley, sunflower, goosefoot, and erect knotweed are just some of a cast of ancient \u201cLost Crops\u201d now only present in the archaeobotanical record. Little is known about this early agriculture, but in order to gain greater insight, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History have joined forces with the Lost Crops Garden Network, a network of American scholars concerned with crop reconstruction. This project proposes that the wild ancestors of these, now lost, crops shared a distinct set of traits, which suggest that their seeds were dispersed via consumption by animals (endozoochoric). Their thesis ist that the megafaunal herds of the Pleistocene and bison of the Holocene were the primary dispersal mechanism for these early-domesticated species, and this project plans to test this hypothesis in the Mississippi region, an ideal natural laboratory given the vast herds of bison that continued to thrive there until the 1850s.<\/p>\n<p>Having consumed the wild plants laden with seeds in their thousands, bison would defecate the seeds into a nitrogen-rich bed of fertilizer, thereby playing an essential role in their germination and dispersal. Their diet and ethology would possibly lead to dense patches of annual plants within the tallgrass prairies, similar to cultivated fields. Human beings may have been capable of harvesting and maintaining such convenient sources of nutrition, a practice that could have led to the domestication of these species and informed subsequent farming practices. If confirmed, this would explain why early agriculture focused on these specific plants. At the same time, it is possible to explain how the current rarity of this species is due to hunting, which disrupted their dispersal mechanism and reduced their number to near extinction in the nineteenth century.<\/p>\n<p>The project hopes to test this novel thesis of the emergence of agriculture and subsequent turn toward industrial agriculture. To do so, the project will carry out three sets of studies in the summer of 2019. The first set involves botanical surveys in tallgrass prairies where herds of bison have been reintroduced. Plant communities will be analyzed and compared to bison-free prairies, to gauge whether bison are a concentration factor. Where possible, dung will be collected and the seeds it contains will be quantified; seed morphology will be documented also. Two more studies will involve controlled experiments with captive bison. One will determine the relationship between their digestive tract and seed germination rates. Another will use bison dung as a growth matrix to test its effect on yield and morphology of Lost Crop progenitors. The results of these experiments could suggest that grazing animals played a central role in the emergence of agriculture, and that human history is a history of multispecies relationships.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Ancient Bison Herds of the American Midwest and the Domestication of the Lost Crops","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"ancient-bison-herds-of-the-american-midwest-and-the-domestication-of-the-lost-crops","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-01-27 15:11:55","post_modified_gmt":"2020-01-27 14:11:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=5369","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"thithutrang.tran","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/ancient-bison-herds-of-the-american-midwest-and-the-domestication-of-the-lost-crops\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":11019,"id":11019,"title":"Herd_of_Buffalo_highres","filename":"Herd_of_Buffalo_highres.jpg","filesize":848914,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Herd_of_Buffalo_highres.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/ancient-bison-herds-of-the-american-midwest-and-the-domestication-of-the-lost-crops\/herd_of_buffalo_highres\/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY 2.0<\/a>","caption":"A herd of buffalo grazing in a field in the North American Midwest.
