Holling\u2019s concept of adaptive modeling, through which models are understood as tools of self-instruction and collective learning about complex systems and their possible future trajectories. In \u201cLimits to Growth,\u201d Miriam Diamond picks up this most famous publication of 1972 that alerted the world to the likelihood of collapse in both human and natural systems. The final major exercise, introduced by Chris Strashok, allowed students to use the Global Systems Simulator, a sophisticated integrated assessment model, to explore avenues toward achieving sustainability by manipulating a wide range of factors, from population and production to agriculture and pollution.

Indeed, a frequently adopted mental model is that the overall state of segregation merely translates, by aggregation, the racism of individuals. If people actively wanted to live with others of a different color, or did not care at all about their race, then we should find that, globally, neighborhoods mix the different colors.
