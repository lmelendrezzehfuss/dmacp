In order to develop a broader understanding of possible solutions, we need to recognize that there are different economic approaches based on diverging perspectives: on human\u2012nature relationships, the markets, and sustainable development. However, due to the bias in economics education at present, there is a risk that future decision-makers will adopt the narrow worldview of mainstream economics, making them insusceptible to alternative solutions.
