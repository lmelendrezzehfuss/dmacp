At this interdisciplinary conference, scholars gathered to analyze and disentangle these complexities through a focus on the regional specificities of India. In doing so, the aim was to trouble the boundaries between multiple practices and open up a discussion across traditional disciplinary categories of knowledge production.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conference is divided into three broad parts to enable the sharing of diverse ideas by very different practices and includes keynote lectures and moderated panels, along with discussions with the audience.

Rather than merely intervening in the Earth system, human technologies are now bringing about transformations of planetary scale.<\/p>\n<p>As Scherer points out, entire infrastructures, such as complex electricity and data networks, have been built around these technologies, effectively creating a second \u201cnature,\u201d through which not only the environment but human activity itself has become exploitable, commodified, and in that way, naturalized. The availability of social processes in the form of data sets then paves the way for the smooth and seamless control of societal activities. Looking into the future, Scherer therefore stresses the necessity to reclaim the cultural-political space from technological governance.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl mt-12 mb-24\">\n<div class=\"text-block text-xl max-w-3xl mx-auto my-12 px-6 md:px-12\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"max-w-4xl mx-auto my-12 md:px-3 lg:px-0\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n ","post_title":"The Naturalization of Humans in the Anthropocene","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"state-of-nature-in-india","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-30 11:09:59","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-30 09:09:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contribution&#038;p=9620","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contribution","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/state-of-nature-in-india\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":9693,"id":9693,"title":"9M1A9237","filename":"9M1A9237.jpg","filesize":7407110,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/state-of-nature-in-india\/9m1a9237\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"","caption":"","name":"9m1a9237","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":9620,"date":"2019-09-13 15:21:31","modified":"2019-09-13 15:21:31","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":6720,"height":4480,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9237-1600x1067.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}},"teaser_text":"<p class=\"text\">Bernd Scherer discusses the various ways in which technology shapes human society and calls attention to the capacities to which algorithmic software modifies our view of the world.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","contributors":[{"ID":2991,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:08","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:08","post_content":"","post_title":"Bernd M.

Drawing on wider intellectual history, Bilgrami first discusses the connection between the rationality of capitalism, political liberalism, and societal alienation and secondly argues for a complete terminus of capitalist systems.<\/p>\n ","post_title":"State of Nature: Some Philosophical Issues","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"state-of-nature-some-philosophical-issues","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-30 11:11:53","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-30 09:11:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=contribution&#038;p=9692","menu_order":0,"post_type":"contribution","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"astrid.zimmermann","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/state-of-nature-some-philosophical-issues\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":9754,"id":9754,"title":"9M1A9297 - Kopie","filename":"9M1A9297-Kopie.jpg","filesize":7280088,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/contribution\/state-of-nature-some-philosophical-issues\/9m1a9297-kopie\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"","caption":"","name":"9m1a9297-kopie","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":9692,"date":"2019-09-13 15:30:58","modified":"2019-09-13 15:30:58","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":6720,"height":4480,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie-768x512.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":512,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie-1400x933.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":933,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1024,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1365,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/9M1A9297-Kopie-1600x1067.jpg","feature-width":1600,"feature-height":1067}},"teaser_text":"<p class=\"text\">How can the debate on the environmental crisis be re-politicized?
