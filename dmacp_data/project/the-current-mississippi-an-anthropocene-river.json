Through sound-based media, Abb\u00e9y Odunlami and Jared Richardson\u2019s collaborative project explores a series of narratives woven together to illustrate what life is like for many in the Delta. The piece sheds a much-needed spotlight on the ecological factors that shape the region\u2019s urban landscape.<\/p>\n <p><em>Broadcasting Live from Field Station 5 <\/em>uses a narrative-driven podcast to detail the spatial politics of the Mississippi Delta. These episodes examine how the region\u2019s various communities negotiate land and water. Concerning the aquatic, this project highlights the following issues in neoliberalism and waste management: the lack of drinking water in Jackson, Missouri, due to privatization of the reservoir and pollution of the river and swamplands around New Orleans by the petrochemicals industry. Regarding the terrain, the project also analyzes the racially segregated, urban space of Memphis, Tennessee, and Jackson. Scholars, including Dr. Chelsea Frazier, Dr. Justin Hosbey, and Dr. J. T. Roane respectively, shed light on how black artists and activists foreground gender and race in their articulations of environmental justice. In New Orleans, Birthmark Doulas, a midwife collective laboring in the alternative birth movement, reveals how reproductive rights intersect with environmentalism, further fortifying black feminist ecologies and solidarities (e.g. Black women and \u201cfemme\u201d-centered institutions and issues). In Jackson, Cooperation Jackson\u2019s worker-owned economic models represent economic justice. Together, despite industrial pollution, these two organizations expand the bodily and economic autonomy of their communities.<\/p>\n<p>Across academic, artistic, faith-based, and community organizations, <em>Broadcasting Live from Field Station 5<\/em> examines the everyday stories of the Mississippi Delta, material that simultaneously alerts us to the global malaise of environmental

This project contemplates the two sides of geology through the voices of paleo-geologists who read the earth\u2019s layers to construct a history of our planet, and miners who have visited the earth\u2019s ancient records in the process of extraction.The resulting installation asks what we have inherited\u2013and what we bequeath to the future.<\/p>\n <p>Beneath the rolling hills of Southern Illinois lies the fossilized section of a forest that once covered this continent. Stretched for 100 miles along both sides of an ancient river as wide as the Mississippi, this fossil forest cuts across the heart of the Illinois Basin coal seam, forged from peat soils where ferns and giant trees (Arborescent Lycopods) once anchored their roots.<\/p>\n<p>It took over 300 million years to sequester the carbon that lies under Southern Illinois in the form of coal. It has taken a mere 200 years and the labor of thousands of coal miners to extract that carbon destined to fuel the lifestyle that defines our inheritance.<\/p>\n<p>Miners are on the front lines. Many of them have seen the remnants of the fossil forest that remains hidden to those above ground. Coal miners are also the first to personally experience the costs of the industry.<\/p>\n<p>This exhibition will be accompanied by a guided walk with geologists Scott Elrick and Jeremy

The seminar unfolds over five days in the landscape marked physically by the action of glaciers, shaped by the enduring presence of Indigenous nations, and defined politically by the colonization that intensified after the 1832 Black Hawk conflict. Bringing together Native leaders, local residents, scholars, activists, and artists for a series of lectures, tours, and conversations, the seminar aims to understand the origins and effects of the

and Insignificant Mounds<\/em> looks to read two landscapes across one another in order to complicate our understandings of authenticity, meaning, and form.<\/p>\n  <p>We are told that prior to European contact North America was a territory defined by its emptiness: a space without human mark, a fallow continent, devoid of evidence of human occupation and meaning. Yet, beneath the settler-colonial ploughs, pierced by the land surveyors\u2019 monuments and shrouded by cities and fields, a vast network of Native American mounds predate European contact. Standing as silent witnesses to millennia of settlement in North America, as evidence of being and meaning, they put to rest this narrative of absence. However, alongside the burial, effigy, and temple mounds are our present-day forms: The slag heaps, landfills, and sundry detritus of an anthropogenic landscape humans make when we aren\u2019t thinking about making landscapes. <em>Significant and Insignificant Mounds<\/em> looks to read these two landscapes across one another in order to complicate our understandings of authenticity, meaning, and form.<\/p>\n <p>The project looks to the building and un-building of landscapes\u2014the mounds and mines, piles and pits\u2014to define one symptom of the anthropogenic condition we inhabit today. It sets up a flicker of signification between the proximate and the distant, to push back on a narrative of singularity, to position humans within a continental history that long predates contact, and to draw an interpretive arc that crosses through the now and the then and the forever. After all, each of these mounds, on its own terms, is both significant and insignificant. They are all markers of a way of being, a way of shaping the world\u2014where meaning mingles uneasily with form.<\/p>\n<p>As an extension of the three years of research within <em>The American Bottom<\/em> project, this project extends the research to Missouri and St. Louis in order to tell a more complete story of pre-contact landscape transformation in the region. While Cahokia remains the signal mound site in the public imagination\u2014if such an imaginary exists\u2014its visibility also works in many ways to conceal the hundreds of other mound sites in the region. As such, this project will connect these sites with a broader history of indigenous inhabitation, and ask questions about commemoration, narrative meaning, and municipal priorities. It focuses on three sites: the Big Mound site in North St. Louis (erased by a small stone monument), the Sugarloaf Mound site in South St. Louis (a single-family house built atop a Native American mound), and the Forest Park Mound Group in the west of the city (with the entire Group leveled for the 1904 World\u2019s Fair). Each of these sites carries with it the many layers of inhabitation and erasure expected in a region with an aggressive pairing of settler-colonial histories and erased indigenous histories set in stark relief.<\/p>\n<p><em>Significant and Insignificant Mounds<\/em> approaches the topic of mounds through writing, an exhibition, and embodied experience. Alongside an essay that historicizes and reads across millennia of material accumulation, this project will also take form as a billboard installation at the Big Mounds site and a bus tour\u2014beginning at the Cahokia Mounds archeological site and ending at the Weldon Spring disposal site. Arguably the area\u2019s most defining mound sites, both installation and tour provide material substance and meaning to the anthropogenic epoch of the region.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Significant and Insignificant Mounds","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"significant-and-insignificant-mounds","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-10-22 17:03:27","post_modified_gmt":"2019-10-22 15:03:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":2712,"guid":"http:\/\/cms.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=project&#038;p=2718","menu_order":0,"post_type":"project","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"mira.witte_admin","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/significant-and-insignificant-mounds\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":8290,"id":8290,"title":"BigMound","filename":"BigMound.jpg","filesize":2375610,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/BigMound.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-3-anthropocene-vernacular\/significant-and-insignificant-mounds\/bigmound\/","alt":"","author":"9","description":"Daguerreotype by Thomas M.

Residency <p>Over the past six months, four artists\u2014Andrea Carlson, Tia-Simone Gardner, John Kim, and Jenny Schmid\u2014have developed new short films inspired by the Headwaters field station. An aesthetics of displacement, as it relates to bodies of water, runs through each of the works. The artists participating in the residency were selected on account of their pre-existing practices that entail a critical envisioning of the Mississippi River and\/or an assessment of the environmental impacts of human activities on bodies of water. A common theme in the artists\u2019 work is an aesthetics of displacement.<\/p>\n <p><u>1<\/u><\/p>\n<p>Looking down on St. Anthony Falls from the walls of the lock and dam infrastructure, one can marvel at this feat of technical engineering. The river runs over an artificial concrete platform creating the Falls. The lock with its giant metal gates holds back millions of gallons of water. It is a triumph of modern engineering and architecture, built for commercial river traffic in pursuit of profit and progress.<\/p>\n<p>The lock is now closed; its gates welded shut. Today, when standing atop the lock and dam, one cannot help but reflect critically on its existence as a monument to a different time, a pre-climate change past. During a spring season that has witnessed extensive flooding up and down the Mississippi River, one cannot help but worry about its inadequacy and anticipate failure.<\/p>\n<p><u>2<\/u><\/p>\n<p>In its current obsolescence, the aged lock and dam infrastructure is a monument to a dark history. Built into its hard structures is the historical legacy of a technic for the displacement of material, non-humans, and human communities. Its presence speaks to the violence of forced movement and dislocation. In a material sense, a dam is engineered to displace water, to hold it back and redirect its flow. The concrete walls and embankments are fortified barriers for keeping nature at bay. The dam is a military technology as well. It shares a history with the berm, which acts as a human breakwater, a defensive technology for the displacement and separation of groups of people.<\/p>\n<p><u>3<\/u><\/p>\n<p>Over the past six months, four artists have developed new short films inspired by our field station&#8217;s approach to <em>Mississippi. An Anthropocene River<\/em>. They were selected because of pre-existing practices that involved a critical envisioning of the Mississippi River and\/or an assessment of the environmental impacts of human activities on bodies of water. A common theme in the artists&#8217; work is an aesthetics of displacement. Andrea Carlson\u2019s site-specific short film, <em>The Uncompromising Hand <\/em>(2017), revisits Spirit Island, a sacred site to multiple Indigenous communities that was once in the Mississippi River near the current lock and dam. Tia-Simone Gardner\u2019s <em>Reading the River: Yemaya and Oshun<\/em> (2018) is an experimental documentary set in port cities along the Lower Mississippi River and reflects on Blackness in relation to geography, architecture, and a feminist practice of unsettling how we think and know place. Jenny Schmid\u2019s prints, including <em>The Last Tree Huggers <\/em>(2017) and <em>Momento Mare <\/em>(2017) feature monstrous creatures who make an uneasy home in the environmental ruin of a disastrous present. John Kim&#8217;s piece, <em>Dam, Lock, Groyne: The Temporal Architecture of the Mississippi River<\/em> (2019) is a reflection on the hard structures and earthworks found along the entire length of the Mississippi River that displace water, people, and non-human species.

Tracing the postnatural expansion of the Asian Carp.<\/span><\/p>\n Embodiment, Ecology, and Culture of a Postnatural Carp <p>There are some species that have been bolstered rather than hampered by the era of the Anthropocene. Through their work, Sarah Lewison and Andrew Yang trace the postnatural expansion of one such species, seeking modes of convivial coexistence as opposed to eradication.<\/p>\n <p>The Asian Carp is a creature of the Anthropocene par excellence. Reviled for its invasiveness in the Mississippi and its tributaries, it has become part of the river\u2019s second nature. By exploring the entangled cultural and natural history of the carp fundamental questions arise concerning how humans, non-humans, and landscapes reshape each other. <em>Reshaping the Shape<\/em> seeks to follow the stories and forms through which the Asian Carp might be reimagined and transformed from public enemy to a mascot of a global commons.<\/p>\n<p>In following the fish\u2019s journey through the economic and cultural landscape, viewers are invited to consider how humans have made the rivers more habitable for the carp. Through interviews and research, the project asks how we might adapt to living together with these fish. It suggests answers through a series of interventions such as informational placemats and billboards that tell the carp\u2019s story, and convivial meals of artisanal fish cakes created with local chefs. Reshaping the Shape debuts on Earth Day with a festoon of carp banners at Carbondale\u2019s \u201cAll Species Parade,\u201d event where people dressed as animals march together through the streets. A public workshop for making Carp Kite windsocks will take place earlier in the month, as part of bringing the image of Hypophthalmichthys fish into the cultural life of Southern Illinois.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","post_title":"Reshaping the

First, the project identifies the site of the river as crucial for investigating representations of the Anthropocene\u2019s impact. Second, it proposes experimental documentary film as\u00a0 an embodied, sensorial approach for capturing the human and nonhuman practices of world-making cataloged by rivers such as the Mississippi. Through a range of shooting methods, the project attempts to (re)visualize the histories\u2014and environmental violence\u2014the river harbors.<\/p>\n <p>As meandering givers of life and arteries of the earth, rivers bridge land and water, and are crucial for life to flourish. Yet so many rivers have become wretched waters: sites of extensive mining waste, hydroextraction, oil refineries, pulp mills, radiation poisoning, and other irreversible environmental disasters.<\/p>\n<p>This applies not just to the great Mississippi, but to all rivers. Once poison courses through an artery it spreads exponentially, uncontainable and unknowable. Rivers are a fractal connector, tying together entire continents, civilizations past and present, human with nonhuman, sediment with atoms. Rivers represent a different type of world-making practice, where the assemblage of a lotic ecosystem \u201cgenerates not a singular knowledge of the world but a world multiple.\u201d<span class=\"annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-target\"><\/span><span class=\"relative\"><span class=\"annotation-ring\"><\/span><\/span><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner\"><\/span><span class=\"annotation-content hidden xl:inline leading-tight\"><span class=\"annotation-counter annotation-counter-outer\"><\/span>Keiichi Omura, Grant Jun Otsuki, Shiho Satsuka, Atsuro Morita, eds., <em>The World Multiple: The Quotidian Politics of Knowing and Generating Entangled Worlds.<\/em> Oxford: Routledge, 2018.<\/span><\/span> Rivers are thus a prime site to investigate representations of what Rob Nixon has termed \u201cslow violence\u201d in the so-called Anthropocene.<\/p>\n<p>In asking how slow violence has been visualized, sonified, and <em>per<\/em>sonified, what kinds of tropes arise, and how might media methods engage more fully with a different type of representation? Ecocinema is capable of addressing complex systems and lifeworlds that contain historical junctures and multiple entanglements between humans and nonhumans. How can we think critically through a type of embodied sensorial practice that takes seriously encounters between humans and nonhumans? In doing so, what possibilities emerge for taking on complex space-time assemblages in the Mississippi that connect history, colonialism, slavery, waterscapes, chemical legacies, invisible harm, and other long-lasting effects of various disasters?<\/p>\n<p><em>The Panesthetic River<\/em>, affirms that filmmaking allows a non-linguistic attunement to the world that opens new speculative possibilities of creating multiple future worlds in the time of deep ecological crisis. Against the backdrop of the <em>Mississippi: An Anthropocene River<\/em> project, my work challenges anthropocentric representations of the Mississippi through several speculative nonfiction film methods in an attempt to seek different ways of making visible and audible the slow violence of the anthropocene and open new worlds beyond the long-now of \u201csavage capitalism,\u201d as suggested by Sven Beckert.<\/p>\n<p>These methods all encompass an approach I call \u201cpanesthesia,\u201d which I define as a layering and accounting of all the senses at once. It is inspired in part by Donna Haraway\u2019s situated knowledge, Anna Tsing\u2019s arts of noticing, and Karen Barad\u2019s agential realism. I may tie myself, through a wireless lavalier microphone, to a person for the duration of the day, performing a type of expanded interview and attuning myself to a new rhythm. I may listen to the river through a hydrophone. I may use various camera mounts to be either inside, on top of, or below the river or other living beings. I may use time-lapse as a durational tool to see processes happening on a different timescale. I may use endoscopes to follow a snail\u2019s path along an embankment. I may use electromagnetic microphones to pick up on electromagnetic frequencies from towers, windmills, and industrial plants. Each of these methods attempts to enter another world without pretending to understand, while within the limits of our cinematic and sensorial realms.<\/p>\n<p>This layering of different embodied, sensorial approaches stretches the meaning of interviewing, listening, and seeing in an attempt to refocus our attention on the slower crisis of attritional environmental violence. In thinking through\u00a0decentering the human and taking seriously more-than-human realities in the \u201canthropo\u201dcene, what role can experimental documentary film play?<\/p>\n","post_title":"The Panesthetic
