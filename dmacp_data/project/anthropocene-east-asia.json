That it is the name of the geological time means that time of the Anthropocene covers the entire globe. But how can the whole Earth be covered by one epoch? Even if so, how is human subjectivity and experience measured and evaluated in this time duration? The way how human subjectivity and self exists differs from culture to culture. On the one hand, the concept of the Anthropocene is hallmarked by the concept of nature\/culture divide developed in western civilization. Seen under the light of the East Asian experience, however, it can be defined in another way. There might (or must) be another (or plural) environmental subjectivity in this globe ; To think about the Anthropocene is to re-think about \u201cour\u201d idea of environment in multiple

11th International Symposium<\/p>\n","start":"03\/10\/2017","end":"03\/11\/2017","description":"<p>During the last fifty years Asia has gone through a remarkable transformation from a largely rural, agricultural and protoindustrial region underpinned by Monsoon Asia\u2019s resource and ecosystem characteristics, to the global center of economic growth driven by massive imports of fossil fuels and the policy directives of the developmental states. Beginning from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and diffusing to Southeast Asia, China and to some extent even to South Asia, a series of industrial clusters were created along the coasts of Pacific and Indian Oceans. Political and economic forces reorganized Asia\u2019s resource base by combining locally available endowments of labour, land, water and eco-system services with imported capital, oil, natural gas and mineral resources. Manufacturing labour productivity rapidly rose, and urbanization was accelerated. A 1983 World Bank Survey The Energy Transition in Developing Countries spoke confidently of the transition from biosphere-based to fossil-fuel-based energy as a global trend.<\/p>\n<p>Today the energy transition refers to a transition from fossil-fuels to cleaner and renewable energy. The term Anthropocene is used to express deep concerns for human impact on the planet. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a UN initiative, include a number of indicators relating to sustainability and resilience to disasters, along with socio-economic ones such as poverty reduction and inequality. Thus the entire \u2018economic miracle\u2019 projects, which dominated Asia and were underpinned by growth ideology, are under serious scrutiny. Yet how to absorb the legacy of such a history back into the more natural and sustainable resource base of Monsoon Asia is not in sight.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016 the Research Institute of Humanity and Nature (RIHN) started its third term research program (2016-2023) with a new organizational design under three programs of social transformations under climate change, resource management and the creation of the &#8220;lifeworlds&#8221; beyond the &#8220;economic miracle&#8221; perspective. In this symposium, we present frontier knowledge directing these programs, to discuss the future of Asia\u2019s transformations to sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Further information at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chikyu.ac.jp\/rihn_e\/events\/symposiums\/no11.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chikyu.ac<\/a><\/p>\n","contributors":false,"methods":[{"term_id":2,"name":"Sensing","slug":"sensing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2,"taxonomy":"method","description":"","parent":0,"count":86,"filter":"raw","author_name":"anujah.fernando","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"Keywords":[{"term_id":174,"name":"Agriculture","slug":"agriculture","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":174,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":59,"filter":"raw","author_name":"anujah.fernando","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":204,"name":"Economy","slug":"economy","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":204,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":42,"filter":"raw","author_name":"anujah.fernando","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"location":"Research Institute for Humanity and Nature 457-4 Kamigamo Motoyama Kita-ku, Kyoto, 603-8047 Japan","map":{"address":"Research Institute for Humanity and Nature 457-4 Kamigamo Motoyama Kita-ku, Kyoto, 603-8047 Japan","lat":35.0725093,"lng":135.7644767,"zoom":14,"place_id":"ChIJg5LYY8KnAWARsJviEAMBpFg","city":"Kyoto","state":"Kyoto","post_code":"603-8047","country":"Japan","country_short":"JP"}}},{"ID":13320,"post_author":"37","post_date":"2018-01-25 16:15:25","post_date_gmt":"2018-01-25 15:15:25","post_content":"","post_title":"Global Environment and Democracy","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"global-environment-and-democracy","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-04-28 12:08:08","post_modified_gmt":"2020-04-28 10:08:08","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/?post_type=event&#038;p=13320","menu_order":0,"post_type":"event","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","author_name":"melissa.canbaz","permalink":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/events\/global-environment-and-democracy\/","acf":{"thumbnail":{"ID":13321,"id":13321,"title":"0001","filename":"0001.jpg","filesize":949358,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/events\/global-environment-and-democracy\/attachment\/0001\/","alt":"","author":"37","description":"","caption":"","name":"0001","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":13320,"date":"2019-10-07 14:09:27","modified":"2019-10-07 14:09:27","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2481,"height":3508,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001-543x768.jpg","thumbnail-width":543,"thumbnail-height":768,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001-212x300.jpg","medium-width":212,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001-768x1086.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":1086,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001-990x1400.jpg","large-width":990,"large-height":1400,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001.jpg","1536x1536-width":1086,"1536x1536-height":1536,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001.jpg","2048x2048-width":1448,"2048x2048-height":2048,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/0001-849x1200.jpg","feature-width":849,"feature-height":1200}},"teaser_text":"<p>This colloquium and workshop will rethink how to define the democracy in the Anthropocene and seek a new way to the future-planning which overcomes this &#8220;Anthropocenic&#8221; difficulty.<\/p>\n","start":"01\/27\/2018","end":"01\/27\/2018","description":"<p>Who is we and what is justice in the epoch of the Anthropocene?

workshop on the interlinkage of the production of knowledge of Japan to new forms of engagement with contemporary ecological concerns.<\/p>\n","start":"10\/27\/2017","end":"10\/28\/2017","description":"<p>How does research on Japan inform ecological practice that is pertinent beyond the framework of area studies, and vice versa? If we were to place nature at the core of our studies of human activities, what new kinds of interdisciplinarity and knowledge would be possible, and how would we reorganize our academic disciplines? Initiated by Eiko Honda and Alice Freeman, this workshop invites individual papers from UK-based Postgraduates and Early Career Researchers within the Humanities for an inter-disciplinary discussion with guidance from established scholars and practitioners.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s world of planetary-scale environmental crises, intellectuals are increasingly urged to cultivate a symbiosis between knowledge and practice and to engage with each other beyond disciplinary divides. Historically, Japan has claimed a uniquely harmonious relationship with nature. Yet this cultural rhetoric of ecology has faced challenges for its apparent discordance with the reality of environmental destruction in Japan.<\/p>\n<p>The field of Japanese Studies outside Japan has also been criticised: on the one hand, for exoticising Japan as a unique \u201cother\u201d, yet conversely, for forcing Japan into a hegemonic model of universal (Western) modernity. While such ideological controversies are ongoing, the study of Japan in the twenty-first century is becoming increasingly and inescapably intertwined with the rise of global environmental problems such as climate change, nuclear catastrophe, deforestation and threats to marine life. The challenges of ecocriticism follow hot on the heels of the politics of still-prevailing Orientalism.<\/p>\n<p>In the rapidly changing academic and atmospheric climates of the twenty-first century, the career paths of current graduates and early career researchers are likely to follow very different trajectories to those of our seniors. The workshop seeks to open a dialogue among this emerging generation of Japan scholars in the UK concerning how the production of knowledge of Japan may be linked to new forms of engagement with contemporary ecological concerns.

Especially in the modern period of dramatic human-environmental change, it distinguishes the Earth as a grand collective project and problematic, so appearing to justify and legitimize a new round of techno-scientific management of the \u201cEarth System\u201d. At the same time, the \u201cenvironmental crisis\u201d has also been called a crisis of culture, and thus of imagination. In this sense, it begs the attention of the humanities, which have always been concerned with the human experience, even as it challenges their underlying assumptions and practices.<\/p>\n<p>This symposium engages the tripartite challenge facing humanities scholarship today: the need to expand beyond Western narrative\/disciplinary super-structures\u2014in which human separation from nature is a fundamental component\u2014and to simultaneously address \u201calternative\u201d subjects and societal experience and the role of environment and nature itself as constituent element in this experience.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense the Anthropocene concept\u2014useful now as it encapsulates in a single word the grand theoretical tradition that has so defined Western understandings of modernity and nature itself\u2014must be taken down to the ground, to the lived experience that composes the long cultural-ecological histories of Asia. The Anthropocene therefore presents an epistemological problem that, if taken seriously, is also ultimately an ontological opportunity. The question of the knowledge that is considered legitimate and relevant now as human societies face rapid social-ecological change is linked so closely to particular cultural understandings of the agencies that constitute the known world. How to see such knowledge, cultures and ecologies in themselves as agents that indeed have also created the Earth?<\/p>\n<p>This symposium asks humanities and interdisciplinary scholars how to re-conceptualize the significance of the humanities now, in light of the history and modern day contexts of Asia, in which humankind\u2019s inevitable experience has formed part of an always dynamic, yet changeable nature.<\/p>\n<p>Further information at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chikyu.ac.jp\/rihn_e\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chikyu.ac<\/a><\/p>\n","contributors":false,"methods":false,"Keywords":[{"term_id":232,"name":"Knowledge transformation","slug":"knowledge-transformation","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":232,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":35,"filter":"raw","author_name":"anujah.fernando","permalink":false,"acf":[]},{"term_id":243,"name":"Naturecultures","slug":"naturecultures","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":243,"taxonomy":"keyword","description":"","parent":0,"count":46,"filter":"raw","author_name":"anujah.fernando","permalink":false,"acf":[]}],"location":"Research Institute for Humanity and Nature 457-4 Kamigamo Motoyama Kita-ku, Kyoto, 603-8047 Japan","map":{"address":"Research Institute for Humanity and Nature 457-4 Kamigamo Motoyama Kita-ku, Kyoto, 603-8047 Japan","lat":35.0725093,"lng":135.7644767,"zoom":14,"place_id":"ChIJg5LYY8KnAWARsJviEAMBpFg","city":"Kyoto","state":"Kyoto","post_code":"603-8047","country":"Japan","country_short":"JP"}}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"featured","title":"Contributions","display":"grid","items":[{"ID":12774,"post_author":"37","post_date":"2017-01-01 17:44:23","post_date_gmt":"2017-01-01 16:44:23","post_content":"<p>As a term \u201cAnthropocene\u201d is linguistic, cultural, and supposedly natural all at the same time what are its possibilities and limits?<\/p>\n  <p>&#8220;How might our conception of the Earth in geological time influence media, and in turn, how might media directly impact our planet?
