In the face of institutionalized dispossession, industrial and residential expansion, and the growth of public and private conservation, Native Americans are protecting these places and resources with an innovative combination of public and private conservation tools. This work at the intersections of Native American Studies, Environmental Policy, and Environmental and Federal Indian law focuses on the tools that tribes (federally recognized and unrecognized) and Native non-profits are using to protect, access, acquire, and steward lands that were\\\/are out of Native jurisdiction. Such tools include land trusts and conservancies, new market tax credits, carbon offsets, co-management, consultation and mitigation, and inter-tribal conservation organizations. Tribal applications of these tools represent the integration of tribal priorities, traditional perspectives, and the exercise of inherent sovereignty to steward homelands.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Dr. Beth Rose Middleton Manning<\\\/strong> is Associate Professor of Native American Studies at UC Davis.

traveling seminar considers the ongoing geological, biological, and social formation of the Midwest in order to locate the historical, political and philosophical roots of the environmental crisis as it manifests in this territory. The seminar unfolds over five days in the landscape marked physically by the action of glaciers, shaped by the enduring presence of Indigenous nations, and defined politically by the colonization that intensified after the 1832 Black Hawk conflict. Bringing together Native leaders, local residents, scholars, activists, and artists for a series of lectures, tours, and conversations, the seminar aims to understand the origins and effects of the present engineered landscape and build alliances for more just and sustainable futures.<\/p>\n<p>The seminar concludes in Saukenuk, the center of the Sauk homelands and the largest city in Illinois for the first decades of the 19th century. It was the need to plant the fields around Saukenuk that led Black Hawk&#8217;s band to ignore the provisions of a fraudulent treaty and cross the Mississippi in April 1832, triggering the events culminating in the Bad Axe Massacre. Three years later, John Deere began manufacturing the eponymous plow that would transform the prairie into commodity agriculture. Yet the catastrophic environmental transformations wrought by settlement have not exterminated Indigenous political and ecological practices, which have persisted and adapted to what Kyle Powys White calls the post-apocalyptic conditions of the present. Concluding events celebrate and share practices of Indigenous sovereignty\u00a0and culminate with community cookout at the Black Hawk State Historic Site.<\/p>\n","contributors":[{"ID":3249,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-21 12:37:28","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-21 10:37:28","post_content":"","post_title":"Nicholas
