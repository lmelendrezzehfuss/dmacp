Cycles of human cultural or industrial processes often fail to synchronize with the layers and rhythmic cycles of many other biological, geological, and ecological processes, including the temporality of the flow of the river itself. Mis-matching rhythms of human practices also cause political tension and conflict over ways of life.

Pierre Part residents live near the path of one of the river\u2019s main release valves, the Morganza Spillway. When opened, it threatens the town with waterborne sediment. Guided by local experts Bruce Barnes and Amy Lesen, the seminar will meet citizens from Pierre Part and discuss the effects of River Basin movements on people\u2019s lives in the area. We will weave music and song into our experience throughout the day.

Amy and Bruce will narrate a history of environmental and cultural change as we re-approach the city. Traveling on Day 2 to Baton Rouge, participants will visit the Louisiana State University\u2019s Lower Mississippi River model, which will demonstrate the dynamic river system and sedimentation processes there.

From a fishing township in the Atchafalaya basin that has seen the ecosystems it has relied upon for generations change at an alarming pace, to the mis-memorialization of history and omission of the stories of those who were enslaved at a former plantation, to a scientific model of the river that both chronicled a past and focused upon a future narrative centered around human control, the seminar evidenced the troubling myriad of temporal clashes at play in the region.
