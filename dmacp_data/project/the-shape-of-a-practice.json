Each seminar explored one of four practices: archiving, sensing, communicating, and consensus building. The seminar program\u2019s focus on method and context aimed to reflect, share, and shape the ideas and means by which the <em>Anthropocene Curriculum<\/em> project has been operating while developing an outlook for the future of each practice and the project at large.<\/p>\n <p>The seminar program provided a space for various AC initiatives, as well as those new to the network, to share the projects they have been working on in recent years\u2014from, e.g., the role of language in proposing alternative understandings of and access to the very concept of the Anthropocene itself; to the implications dissolving notions of nature and the non-human have on the politics of planetary futures; to alternative ways of governance and sensing in the Anthropocene; to new strategies of resistance and protest as an answer to large-scale industrial infrastructures and their ecological and social impacts\u2014and use these experiences as case studies for understanding how challenges, approaches, and practices can be translated across contexts. During the seminars, these case studies were brought into dialogue with each other in order to reflect on the topological relationships and tools employed by the <em>Anthropocene Curriculum<\/em> project with the help of the four practices.<\/p>\n<p>The case studies also provided the source material for the discursive program and will be published and developed further after the event on anthropocene\u2013curriculum.org, entering into the wider research pool and the AC\u2019s ongoing digital publishing program. Through these different forms of exchange, similarities, differences, and the relations between various contexts and scales can be traced to see in which way the methods employed in each case are
