It took a mere 300 years to deform this vital habitat. In 2007, the US State Department\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration removed the names of thirty-one water bodies from maps of Louisiana\u2019s Plaquemines Parish, noting that the erosion of the bays, bayous, and lakes was due to the saltwater of the Gulf encroaching on the \u00a0freshwater vegetation and compacted sediment that defined their perimeters.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the riverside wetlands were drained\u2013\u2013\u201creclaimed\u201d said the Army Corps of Engineers\u2013\u2013for the seeding of plantations. As intensive agriculture increased and vegetation cover was reduced, the \u00a0banks of the river eroded into the waters, doubling its pre-colonial suspended sediment load.

At the same time, the oil and gas industry began to dredge a network of canals to access the wetlands\u2019 subterranean riches. Forming a fraying latticework of uncoordinated and largely \u201corphaned\u201d throughways, this 10,000-mile network of canals and over 75,000 wells has contributed significantly to Louisiana\u2019s coastal erosion crisis.
