The conflict erupted over agriculture: Sauk leader Black Hawk had lead the group across the Mississippi in May to replant their traditional agricultural fields in defiance of a fraudulent treaty. And the conflict resulted in agriculture: the \u201cwar\u201d provided the cover to remove the Indigenous communities that paved the way to settler farms and statehood for Wisconsin and Iowa. This convocation will honor those who lost their lives and lifeways to the settler-colonial violence that unleashed the Anthropocene and examine the responsibilities this inheritance demands.<\/p>\n","thumbnail":{"ID":3384,"id":3384,"title":"Ryan Griffis_PrairieSoy","filename":"Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy.jpg","filesize":208420,"url":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy.jpg","link":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/events\/restoring-the-land\/ryan-griffis_prairiesoy\/","alt":"","author":"10","description":"by Ryan Griffis","caption":"","name":"ryan-griffis_prairiesoy","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":633,"date":"2019-08-21 13:33:21","modified":"2019-09-03 17:08:06","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":1500,"height":500,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy-768x256.jpg","thumbnail-width":768,"thumbnail-height":256,"medium":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy-300x100.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":100,"medium_large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy-768x256.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":256,"large":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy-1400x467.jpg","large-width":1400,"large-height":467,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy.jpg","1536x1536-width":1500,"1536x1536-height":500,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy.jpg","2048x2048-width":1500,"2048x2048-height":500,"tiny-preview":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy-48x48.jpg","tiny-preview-width":48,"tiny-preview-height":48,"feature":"https:\/\/content.anthropocene-curriculum.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ryan-Griffis_PrairieSoy.jpg","feature-width":1500,"feature-height":500}},"teaser_text":"<p>Opening day of the traveling seminar <em>Over the Levee, Under the Plow<\/em>, which situates the escalating environmental crisis of the Anthropocene Midwest within settler colonial histories and narratives.<\/p>\n"}},{"ID":633,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-08-09 12:06:48","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-09 10:06:48","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The first full day of the seminar takes place at the Kickapoo Valley Reserve in La Farge, WI.

In the face of institutionalized dispossession, industrial and residential expansion, and the growth of public and private conservation, Native Americans are protecting these places and resources with an innovative combination of public and private conservation tools. This work at the intersections of Native American Studies, Environmental Policy, and Environmental and Federal Indian law focuses on the tools that tribes (federally recognized and unrecognized) and Native non-profits are using to protect, access, acquire, and steward lands that were\\\/are out of Native jurisdiction. Such tools include land trusts and conservancies, new market tax credits, carbon offsets, co-management, consultation and mitigation, and inter-tribal conservation organizations. Tribal applications of these tools represent the integration of tribal priorities, traditional perspectives, and the exercise of inherent sovereignty to steward homelands.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Dr. Beth Rose Middleton Manning<\\\/strong> is Associate Professor of Native American Studies at UC Davis.

It was the need to plant the fields around Saukenuk that led Black Hawk&#8217;s band to ignore the provisions of a fraudulent treaty and cross the Mississippi in April 1832, triggering the events culminating in the Bad Axe Massacre. Three years later, John Deere began manufacturing the eponymous plow that would transform the prairie into commodity agriculture. Yet the catastrophic environmental transformations wrought by settlement have not exterminated Indigenous political and ecological practices, which have persisted and adapted to what Kyle Powys White calls the post-apocalyptic conditions of the present. Concluding events celebrate and share practices of Indigenous sovereignty\u00a0and culminate with community cookout at the Black Hawk State Historic

Thirteen tan-and-green banners integrate medicinal and edible plants juxtaposed with fragmented text taken from a speech by Ogama Mdew\u00e9 (Chief Metea, Potawatomi) against signing the Treaty of Chicago. This particular treaty was signed in Chicago (1821) and ceded nearly all remaining land south of the Chi-ziibing\/Grand River, including the Land on which Kalamazoo College resides. Ogama Mdew\u00e9\u2019s recorded oratory, which would have been given in Neshnab\u00e9mwen, the Potawatomi language, demonstrates a fervent disagreement with ceding additional Land, as the Anishinaabe (Potawatomi, Odawa, and Ojibwe) had signed three previous treaties in 1807, 1817, and 1819.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Dylan AT Miner includes five horizontal text-based banners, which direct us to think about ongoing Indigenous presence and sovereignty, as well as gesture towards decolonized relationships with the Land. As we approach the 200th anniversary of the 1821 Treaty of Chicago, Miner\u2019s artwork reminds us to critically reflect and act in ways that recognize how treaties and Indigenous sovereignties are both seen and not seen as living and ongoing relationships between Indigenous peoples, settlers, and arrivants.\u00a0<em>This Land is Always<\/em>\u00a0asks that we critically reflect upon Land use and historic, contemporary, and future relationships with the Land and with settler-colonial institutions.<\/p>\n<p>Ryan Griffis\u2019s <em>Beyond Extraction: A Fluid Story<\/em> complements his <em><a href=\"https:\/\/anthropocene-curriculum.org\/project\/mississippi\/field-stations\/field-station-2-anthropocene-drift\/field-guides-to-the-anthropocene-drift\/\">Anthropocene Drift field guide<\/a><\/em>.\u00a0 A selection of water samples from the territory known in settler terminology as the Illinois Headwaters. The Illinois Headwaters is a region where rivers, streams, and agricultural ditches cut through commodity cropland before delivering waters laced with nitrates, atrazine, and glyphosate to the Mississippi River system. These waters have passed through the horrors of extraction while carrying the stories of human and other-than-human resistance to the logics of settler-capitalist extraction. These water samples are a small material artifact of the narrative project represented in Ryan Griffis\u2019 booklet Beyond Extraction: A Partial Political Ecology of Central

along the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the upper Midwest.<\/p>\n <p>This traveling seminar considers the ongoing geological, biological, and social formation of the Midwest in order to locate the historical, political and philosophical roots of the environmental crisis as it manifests in this territory. The seminar unfolds over five days in the landscape marked physically by the action of glaciers, shaped by the enduring presence of Indigenous nations, and defined politically by the colonization that intensified after the 1832 Black Hawk conflict. Bringing together Native leaders, local residents, scholars, activists, and artists for a series of lectures, tours, and conversations, the seminar aims to understand the origins and effects of the present engineered landscape and build alliances for more just and sustainable futures.<\/p>\n","post_title":"Over the Levee, Under the
